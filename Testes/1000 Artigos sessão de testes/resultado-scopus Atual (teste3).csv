Here, we report the 96-week data for the study. Methods: This randomised, open-label, non-inferiority phase 3 trial, was done at two research sites in Johannesburg, South Africa, after participant recruitment from 11 public health clinics also in Johannesburg. Eligible participants were aged 12 years or older with HIV-1 infection, who weighed at least 40 kg, had no antiretroviral exposure in the previous 6 months, with a creatinine clearance of more than 60 mL/min (>80 mL per min in individuals aged <19 years), and a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of 500 copies per mL or higher. Individuals who were pregnant or had tuberculosis were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by study staff using a computerised randomisation system. Randomisation was stratified by age (12 and <19 years and 19 years). Participants were randomly assigned to once-daily oral fixed-dose combination tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg, and once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg; once-daily oral fixed-dose combination tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg, and once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg; or once-daily oral fixed-dose combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and efavirenz 600 mg. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants who had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of less than 50 copies per mL at week 48, which has been reported previously. Here, we report the key secondary efficacy endpoint of the proportion of participants who had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of less than 50 copies per mL at the week 96 visit, assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of any study drug, with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%. Safety data, including clinical, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and laboratory data, are also reported. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03122262. Findings: Between Jan 17, 2017, and May 14, 2018, we screened 1453 individuals, of whom 1053 were enrolled: 351 participants were randomly assigned to the tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, 351 to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, and 351 to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz group. All participants received at least one dose of study medication and were included in the primary analysis. At week 96, 276 (79%) of 351 participants in the tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, 275 (78%) of 351 participants in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, and 258 (74%) of 351 participants in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz group had achieved a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of less than 50 copies per mL. Non-inferiority was established in all three comparisons. The proportion of patients with protocol-defined virological failure at week 96 was low in all treatment groups. Participants in the tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group had fewer changes in bone density than the two other treatment groups. Mean weight gain was substantial (7·1 kg [SD 7·4] in the tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group; 4·3 kg [6·7] in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, and 2·3 kg [7·0] in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz group), and was greater among women than men. Ten (3%) of 351 participants in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz group discontinued due to treatment-related adverse events, of which liver dysfunction (n=4) and rash (n=4) were most common. Interpretation: Medium-term and long-term metabolic and clinical consequences of the considerable increase in bodyweight observed in participants given these antiretroviral regimens and the trajectory of this weight gain over time, especially among women, require further study.

One strategy proposes to eliminate these viral reservoirs by pharmacologically reactivating the latently infected T cells. We show here that a 4-deoxyphorbol ester derivative isolated from Euphorbia amygdaloides ssp. semiperfoliata, 4-dPE A, reactivates HIV-1 from latency and could potentially contribute to decrease the viral reservoir. 4-dPE A shows two effects in the HIV replication cycle, infection inhibition and HIV transactivation, similarly to other phorboids PKC agonists such PMA and prostratin and to other diterpene esters such SJ23B. Our data suggest 4-dPE A is non-tumorigenic, unlike the related compound PMA. As the compounds are highly similar, the lack of tumorigenicity by 4-dPE A could be due to the lack of a long side lipophilic chain that is present in PMA. 4-dPE activates HIV transcription at nanomolar concentrations, lower than the concentration needed by other latency reversing agents (LRAs) such as prostratin and similar to bryostatin. PKC/MEK activation is required for the transcriptional activity, and thus, anti-latency activity of 4-dPE A. However, CD4, CXCR4 and CCR5 receptors down-regulation effect seems to be independent of PCK/MEK, suggesting the existence of at least two different targets for 4-dPE A. Furthermore, NF-b transcription factor is involved in 4-dPE HIV reactivation, as previously shown for other PKCs agonists. We also studied the effects of 4-dPE A in combination with other LRAs. When 4-dPE A was combined with another PKC agonists such as prostratin an antagonic effect was achieved, while, when combined with an HDAC inhibitor such as vorinostat, a strong synergistic effect was obtained. Interestingly, the latency reversing effect of the combination was synergistically diminishing the EC50 value but also increasing the efficacy showed by the drugs alone. In addition, combinations of 4-dPE A with antiretroviral drugs as CCR5 antagonist, NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs, showed a consistent synergistic effect, suggesting that the combination would not interefer with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Finally, 4-dPE A induced latent HIV reactivation in CD4 + T cells of infected patients under ART at similar levels than the tumorigenic phorbol derivative PMA, showing a clear reactivation effect. In summary, we describe here the mechanism of action of a new potent deoxyphorbol derivative as a latency reversing agent candidate to decrease the size of HIV reservoirs.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006295220301659;8.4;6.2;7.5;00062952;113937;;

To determine whether differential rates of clonal proliferation or HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) pressure shape the provirus landscape, we performed an intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) and obtained 661 near-full-length provirus sequences from 8 individuals with suppressed viral loads on ART at time points 7 years apart. We observed slow decay of intact proviruses but no changes in the proportions of various types of defective proviruses. The proportion of intact proviruses in expanded clones was similar to that of defective proviruses in clones. Intact proviruses observed in clones did not have more escaped CTL epitopes than intact proviruses observed as singlets. Concordantly, total proviruses at later time points or observed in clones were not enriched in escaped or unrecognized epitopes. Three individuals with natural control of HIV-1 infection (controllers) on ART, included because controllers have strong HIV-1-specific CTL responses, had a smaller proportion of intact proviruses but a distribution of defective provirus types and escaped or unrecognized epitopes similar to that of the other individuals. This work suggests that CTL selection does not significantly check clonal proliferation of infected cells or greatly alter the provirus landscape in people on ART.;https://www.jci.org/articles/view/135953;21.2;19.0;17.0;00219738;;;

HIV Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British HIV AssociationObjectives: Although outcomes of antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials, experiences from subpopulations defined by age, CD4 count or viral load (VL) in heterogeneous real-world settings are limited. Methods: The study design was an international multicohort collaboration. Logistic regression was used to compare virological and immunological outcomes at 12 ± 3 months after starting ART with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), contemporary nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or boosted protease inhibitor (PI/b) with two nucleos(t)ides after 1 January 2012. The composite treatment outcome (cTO) defined success as VL ' 200 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL with no regimen change and no AIDS/death events. Immunological success was defined as a CD4 count ' 750 cells/L or a 33% increase where the baseline CD4 count was  500 cells/L. Poisson regression compared clinical failures (AIDS/death  14 days after starting ART). Interactions between ART class and age, CD4 count, and VL were determined for each endpoint. Results: Of 5198 ART-naïve persons in the International Cohort Consortium of Infectious Diseases (RESPOND), 45.4% started INSTIs, 26.0% PI/b and 28.7% NNRTIs; 880 (17.4%) were aged ' 50 years, 2539 (49.4%) had CD4 counts ' 350 cells/L and 1891 (36.8%) had VL ' 100 000 copies/mL. Differences in virological and immunological success and clinical failure among ART classes were similar across age groups ( 40, 40–50 and ' 50 years), CD4 count categories ( 350 vs. ' 350 cells/L) and VL categories at ART initiation ( 100 000 vs. ' 100 000 copies/mL), with all investigated interactions being nonsignificant (P ' 0.05). Conclusions: Differences among ART classes in virological, immunological and clinical outcomes in ART-naïve participants were consistent irrespective of age, immune suppression or VL at ART initiation. While confounding by indication cannot be excluded, this provides reassuring evidence that such subpopulations will equally benefit from contemporary ART.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hiv.12888;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;

In this study, we assess the influence of TLR7 and TLR8 gene polymorphisms on HIV-1 susceptibility, AIDS development, and treatment outcomes. The TLR7 and TLR8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped through real-time PCR in 222 patients living with HIV-1 and 141 healthy controls. Frequencies of the TLR7-IVS2-151 G/A and TLR7-IVS1 + 1817 G/T genotypes and alleles were not significantly increased in patients with HIV-1 infection compared to healthy controls both in males and females. Whereas, males carrying TLR8 Met allele were twice susceptible to HIV-1 infection compared to subjects with A allele (OR = 2.04, 95 % CI 1.103.76; p = 0.021). Interestingly, for TLR8-129 G/C, both males and females carrying G allele and GG genotype, respectively were significantly associated with HIV-1 infection (p < 0.0001). Moreover, the TLR7 IVS1 + 1817 G/T and the TLR8 rs3764880 were associated with protection to progress the AIDS stage in male and female, respectively (p < 0.05). Males carrying TLR7 IVS2-151-A allele showed a significant increased level of HIV-1 viral load pre-treatment, in comparison with individuals carrying the G allele (p-value = 0.036). Additionally, males carrying TLR8 Met allele showed statistically higher HIV viral load at baseline (p-value = 0.04) and after treatment (p-value = 0.013). Regarding CD4 + T cell counts, no significant association was found with TLR7 and TLR8 SNPs before and after antiretroviral treatment. This data demonstrates that TLR8 polymorphisms could affect HIV-1 infection. Moreover, an association between TLR7 IVS2-151-A and TLR8 Met alleles and plasma HIV viral load level was found.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165247820303783;5.0;4.5;5.1;01652478;;;

Objective: To investigate the characteristics of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and the extent of changes in drug susceptibility among ART-experienced CRF55_01B-infected adults of Guangdong. Methods: ADR was tested for immediately in CRF55_01B-infected patients with virological failure. Demographic and epidemiological information was collected. DRMs and antiretroviral susceptibility were interpreted using the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database HIVdb program. Results: Overall, 162 (4.78%) CRF55_01B isolates were identified from 2013 to 2018. Among DRMs, M184V (43.83%) was the most frequent NRTI DRM, followed by K65R (23.46%), and V179E (98.77%) was the most frequent NNRTI DRM, followed by K103N (47.53%) and Y181C (14.81%). According to the HIVdb program, 79.01% of the CRF55_01B-infected patients carried mutations conferring low-level or higher drug resistance to any of the three classes of ART drugs. Among PI DRMs, only one mutation affording low-level resistance to nelfinavir was found (0.62%). Among NRTI DRMs, a high proportion of high-level resistance to lamivudine (58.64%) and emtricitabine (58.02%) was found. As regards NNRTIs, more than 75% of patients carried efavirenz and nevirapine DRMs. The percentages of high-level resistance were 70.99%, 63.58%, 22.22%, 17.90% and 4.32% for nevirapine, efavirenz, rilpivirine, doravirine and etravirine, respectively. Conclusions: High frequencies of DRMs and resistance were observed among CRF55_01B-infected patients failing ART in Guangdong, and interventions may be considered to minimize ecological contributions to ART.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/7/1925/5821043;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

Since both cardiovascular and renal disease, and polypharmacy, are common in ageing people with HIV, there is a need for alternative efficacious regimens. bPI-based regimens are often the treatment of choice for individuals with pre-treatment or treatment-acquired resistance but it is plausible that carefully selected HIV-positive individuals with drug resistance, who are virologically suppressed on their current bPI regimen, could maintain virological efficacy when switched to bictegravir, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) fixed dose combination (FDC). Methods/design: A phase IV, investigator-initiated, multicentre, open label pilot, randomised two-arm study to assess the safety and efficacy of switching from bPI regimen to B/F/TAF single tablet regimen in integrase inhibitor-naïve, virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1 infection harbouring drug resistance mutations. Eligible individuals will either continue on their bPI regimen or switch to B/F/TAF FDC. After 24 weeks, all participants in the bPI arm will be switched to B/F/TAF and followed for a further 24 weeks and all participants will be followed for 48 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at week 24 using pure virologic response whilst the secondary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48. Other secondary outcome measures include between arm comparisons of drug resistance at virological failure, safety and tolerability and patient-reported outcome measures. Discussion: We aim to provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy of switching to B/F/TAF in patients with virological suppression on a bPI-based regimen who harbour select drug resistance mutations.

A total of 261 HIV-1-positive plasma samples, confirmed by the Suzhou CDC, were collected and evaluated to detect HIV-1 drug resistance genotypes using an in-house method. The pol gene fragment was amplified, and its nucleic acid sequence was determined by Sanger sequencing. Drug resistance mutations were then analyzed using the Stanford University HIV resistance database (https://hivdb.stanford.edu). A total of 216 pol gene fragments were amplified and sequenced with 16.7% (36/216) of sequences revealing these mutations. The drug resistance rates of protease, nucleoside reverse transcriptase, and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) were 4/36 (11.1%), 2/36 (5.6%), and 30/36 (83.3%), respectively. Five surveillance drug resistance mutations were found in 36 sequences, of which, three were found among specimens of men who have sex with men. Potential low-level resistance accounted for 33% of amino acid mutations associated with NNRTIs. Two of the mutations, M230L and L100I, which confer a high level of resistance efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP) used as NNRTIs for first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART), were detected in this study. Therefore, when HIV-1 patients in Suzhou are administered fist-line ART, much attention should be paid to the status of these mutations that cause resistance to EVP, EFV, and NVP.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11262-020-01774-0;3.0;3.1;3.4;09208569;;;

Methods: All newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases at Beijing YouAn Hospital from January 2012 to December 2013 were selected as the control group, while all newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients from January 2015 to December 2016 were selected as the intervention group, receiving the comprehensive case management model. Results: 4906 patients were enrolled, of which 1549 were in the control group and 3357 in the intervention group. The median time from confirming HIV infection to ART initiation in the intervention group was 35 (18-133) days, much shorter than the control group (56 (26-253) days, P < 0.001). Participants in the intervention group had better ART adherence compared to those in the control group (intervention: 95.3%; control: 89.2%; p < 0.001). During the 2 years' follow-up, those receiving case management were at decreased odds of experiencing virological failure (OR: 0.27, 95%CI: 0.17-0.42, P < 0.001). Observed mortality was 0.4 deaths per 100 patient-years of follow-up for patients in the control group compared with 0.2 deaths per 100 patient-years of follow-up in the intervention group. Conclusions: People living with HIV engaged in the comprehensive case management model were more likely to initiate ART sooner and maintained better treatment compliance and improved clinical outcomes compared to those who received routine care. A comprehensive case management program could be implemented in hospitals across China in order to reduce the HIV disease burden in the country.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05219-9;4.5;4.3;4.1;;489;;

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of reduced doses of both tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and efavirenz for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. In this open-label, non-inferiority trial, HIV-1-infected antiretroviral-naive adults were randomly assigned to receive either a lower dose anti-retroviral regimen comprised of TDF (200 mg), efavirenz (400 mg), and standard dose lamivudine (300 mg) or the standard dose regimen. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA 50 copies/mL at week 48 using a non-inferiority margin of -10%. At week 48, 79 of 92 (85.9%) participants in the lower dose regimen group and 78 of 92 (84.8%) in the standard dose regimen group achieved HIV-1 RNA 50 copies/mL (treatment difference 1.1%, 95% CI -9.1 to 11.3) in the intention-to-treat analysis. Drug-related adverse events occurred more frequently in the participants receiving the standard dose regimen compared with the lower dose one (63.0% vs 80.4%). Changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate and bone mineral density were comparable between the two groups. The non-inferior efficacy and better safety profile of the lower dose ARV regimen support its use as alternative initial therapy for HIV-1 infected patients.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2020.1752609;7.3;4.9;6.9;;;;

We aimed to measure alterations in microbial translocation, monocyte activation, gut immune recovery, and intestinal epithelial cell damage in HAART treated individuals. Methods: A prospective, single-arm, longitudinal, cohort study was conducted among antiretroviral naïve HIV-1 infected Thai participants. All participants were in chronic stage of HIV-1 infection before starting HAART. Data and samples were collected prior to initiation of HAART and then after 24 and 48 weeks of HAART. Plasma biomarkers for microbial translocation (16S rDNA and LBP), monocyte activation (sCD14) and intestinal epithelial cell damage (I-FABP) were evaluated. We measured circulating gut-homing CD4+ T cells and circulating gut-homing Th17 cells to assess recoveries of gut immunity and gut immunity to microbial pathogens. Results: The kinetic studies showed no reduction in the levels of plasma 16S rDNA, sCD14 or I-FABP, significant decrease of plasma LBP level, and slow but significant increases in the frequencies of circulating gut-homing CD4+ T cells and circulating gut-homing Th17 cells during 48 weeks of HAART. Dividing participants into low and high microbial translocation (low and high MT) groups at baseline, both groups showed persistent plasma levels of 16S rDNA, sCD14 and I-FABP, and significantly decreased plasma level of LBP. The low MT group had significantly increased frequencies of circulating gut-homing CD4+ T cells and circulating gut-homing Th17 cells during 48 weeks of HAART but this was not observed in the high MT group. Conclusions: We demonstrated persistent high microbial translocation, monocyte activation and intestinal epithelial cell damage with slow gut immune recovery during successful short-term HAART. Additionally, gut immune recovery was apparently limited by high microbial translocation. Our findings emphasize the adverse impact of high microbial translocation on gut immune recovery and the necessity of establishing a novel therapeutic intervention to inhibit microbial translocation.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1043466620302738;5.8;6.1;5.0;10434666;155257;;

HIV Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British HIV AssociationObjectives: As per National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) estimates, there are 2.1 million people living with HIV (PWH) in India, of whom 1.2 million are on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study explored the use of a single-tablet regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg + lamivudine 300 mg + efavirenz 400 mg (TLE400 STR) as a first-line switch strategy in PWH in Pune, India. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in private sector ART clinics in three tertiary-level hospitals in Pune, India. PWH > 12 years of age (n = 502) who initiated first-line ART (predominantly TLE600 STR), completed  6 months of follow-up and achieved virological suppression [plasma viral load (VL) < 1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL] were identified and switched to TLE400 STR. The virological and immunological efficacy of TLE400 STR at 6 and 12 months of follow-up were noted. Grade 3/4 adverse events (especially efavirenz-related neuropsychiatric adverse events) leading to regimen discontinuation were also noted. Results: Of 502 PWH who switched to TLE400 STR, complete virological suppression (VL < 20 copies/mL) was maintained in more than 97% of patients at follow-up. TLE400 STR was successful in maintaining CD4 counts within the range observed at the start of the regimen. Grade 3/4 adverse events leading to TLE400 STR discontinuation were seen in 11 (2.2%) patients. Virological failure (VL > 1000 copies/mL) and treatment regimen failure were seen in six (1.2%) and 49 (9.8%) subjects, respectively. Conclusions: TLE400 STR exhibits excellent efficacy and safety as a switch strategy and should be introduced in the Indian National ART Program, especially for PWH who are virologically suppressed on TLE600 STR.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hiv.12912;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;

All rights reserved.Background:Bictegravir, coformulated with emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide as a fixed-dose combination (B/F/TAF), is recommended for treatment of HIV-1-infection. Multiple studies of B/F/TAF in treatment-naive and virologically suppressed cohorts have shown high efficacy and tolerability with no treatment-emergent resistance through 48 weeks. Participants in these studies have been predominantly men. We report 48-week results from a phase 3 study evaluating switching to B/F/TAF, specifically in a globally distributed trial population of women.Methods:In this multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, noninferiority trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02652624), women living with HIV who were virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA levels <50 copies/mL) on a regimen containing either TAF or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were randomly assigned (1:1) to switch to B/F/TAF (50/200/25 mg) or stay on baseline regimen (SBR) once daily for 48 weeks. Primary endpoint was proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA 50 copies/mL at week 48 (U.S. Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm); prespecified noninferiority margin was 4%.Findings:We randomized 472 participants and treated 470 (234 B/F/TAF, 236 SBR). Switching to B/F/TAF was noninferior to SBR for the primary outcome, as 1.7% (4/234) vs 1.7% (4/236) had HIV-1 RNA 50 copies/mL at week 48 (difference 0.0%, 95.001% confidence interval: -2.9% to 2.9%). No individual receiving B/F/TAF developed treatment-emergent resistance. Both treatments were well-tolerated; no participant discontinued treatment because of an adverse event.Interpretation:Fixed-dose combination B/F/TAF provides a safe and efficacious option for ongoing treatment of HIV in women.

Here, we report HIV-1 genetic diversity and DRMs in blood samples from 42 HIV-positive pregnant women naive to antiretroviral therapy (ART), in Luanda. The samples were subjected to nested-PCR, followed by sequencing of HIV-1 pol gene, targeting the protease and reverse transcriptase fragments. HIV-1 diversity was analyzed using the REGA HIV-1 subtyping tool and DRMs were identified using the Calibrated Population Resistance tool. A total of 34 sequences were obtained. The data revealed wide HIV-1 subtypes heterogeneity, with subtype C (38%, 13/34) the most frequent, followed by the subtypes F1 (18%, 6/34), A1 (9%, 3/34), G (9%, 3/34), D (6%, 2/34) and H (3%, 1/34). In addition, recombinants strains were detected, with CRF02_AG (6%, 2/34) the most frequent, followed by CRF37_cpx, F1/C, A1/G and H/G, all with 3% (1/34). A total of 6/34 (18%) of the sequences presented DRMs. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors presented 15% (5/34) of resistance. Moreover, 1/34 (3%) sequence presented resistance against both non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, simultaneously. Despite the small sample size, our results suggest the need to update currently used ART regimens. Surveillance of HIV-1 subtypes and DRMs are necessary to understand HIV epidemiology and to guide modification of ART guidelines in Angola.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225251;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0225251;;

In this study, we used a standardised algorithm including a wide range of adherence-enhancing interventions followed by a new viral load measurement to decide whether to switch to third-line therapy in this situation. The decision, made on the basis of effectiveness of the adherence reinforcement to drive viral resuppression, did not use genotypic resistance testing. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, adults in four west African countries with treatment failure of a boosted protease inhibitor ART regimen were offered nine adherence reinforcement interventions, and followed up for 64 weeks. We measured viral load at week 12 and used the results to decide ART treatment at week 16: if successful resuppression (plasma HIV-1 RNA <400 copies per mL or had decreased by 2 log10 copies per mL compared with baseline), patients continued the same second-line regimen; otherwise they switched to a third-line regimen based on ritonavir-boosted darunavir and raltegravir. The primary endpoint was virological success at week 64 (plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL). After study termination we did genotypic resistance testing on frozen plasma samples collected at baseline, and retrospectively determined the appropriateness of the week 16 decision on the basis of the baseline genotypic susceptibility score. Findings: Between March 28, 2013, and May 11, 2015, of the 198 eligible participants, five died before week 16. Of the 193 remaining, 130 (67%) reached viral resuppression and continued with second-line ART, and 63 (33%) switched to third-line ART at week 16. Post-study genotypic resistance testing showed that the baseline genotypic susceptibility score was calculable in 166 patients, of whom 57 (34%) had a score less than 2. We retrospectively concluded that the week 16 decision was appropriate in 145 (75%) patients. At week 64, four patients (2%) were lost to follow-up, ten (5%) had died, and 101 (52%) had a viral load less than 50 copies per mL. Interpretation: Poor adherence is the first problem to tackle in patients for whom second-line ART is failing when resistance tests are not routinely available and is effectively a manageable problem.

However, rapid scale-up of ART and the high HIV-1 genetic variability, has greatly influenced the emergence of drug-resistant strains. This constitutes a potential threat to achieving the UNAIDS’ 90-90-90 goals by 2020. We investigated the prevalent HIV-1 genotypes, drug resistance-associated mutations and assessed some predictors of the occurrence of these mutations. Methods This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study conducted between October 2010 and June 2012. Participants were consecutively enrolled from selected HIV treatment centers of the Southwest and Northwest regions of Cameroon. Viral load was determined with the automated Abbott Real-time HIV-1 m2000rt System. HIV genotyping and antiretroviral resistance mutations analysis were performed using Bayer’s HIV-1 TRUGENE™ Genotyping Kit and OpenGene DNA Sequencing system. The drug resistance mutation was interpreted with the Stanford HIV database. Epidemiological data were obtained using pretested semi-structured questionnaires. Results Of the 387 participants, 239 were successfully genotyped. The median age of these participants was 33 years (interquartile range, IQR: 28–40 years), and a majority (65.7%) were female. A total of 29.3% of the participants were receiving ART. The median duration of ART was 10.5 months (IQR: 4–17.25 months). The median CD4 count and log10 viral load of study participants were 353.5 cells/ml (IQR:145–471) and 4.89 copies/ml (IQR: 3.91–5.55) respectively. CRF02 (A/G) (69%) was the most prevalent subtype followed by G (8.2%) and F (6.7%). Overall, resistance mutations were present in 37.1% of ART-experienced and 10.7% of ART-naive patients. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) mutations occurred in 30% of ART-experienced and 2.4% of ART-naïve patients, while non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) mutations occurred in 34.2% of ART-experienced and 10.1% of -naïve patients. M184V (8.4%, 20/239) and K103N (5.4%, 13/ 239) were the most prevalent mutations. Major protease inhibitor mutations occurred in 3 (1.3%) out of the 239 sequences. The duration of ART independently predicted the occurrence of resistance mutation among ART-experienced patients. Conclusion The high resistance to NNRTIs, which are the main support to the backbone (NRTIs) first-line antiretroviral regimen in Cameroon, has prompted the need to rollout an integrase strand transfer inhibitor regimen (containing Dolutegravir) with a higher genetic barrier to resistance as the preferred first line regimen.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225575;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0225575;;

In Peru, genotypic resistance testing is not routinely performed before ART initiation, and estimated PDR prevalence prior to 2012 ranged from 1.0% to 4.7%. We aimed to update estimates of PDR prevalence in men who have sex with men (cis-MSM) and transgender women (TW). Methods: We obtained HIV sequences from three studies of ART-naïve cisgender-MSM and TW (n = 470) in Lima, Peru from 2013 to 2017, almost two-thirds of whom had acute or recent infections. Sanger sequences of HIV pol were interrogated for surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRM) using the Stanford Calibrated Population Resistance (CPR) tool and scored for resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) with the HIVdb programme. We calculated binomial proportions and 95% confidence intervals. 2 and exact or trend tests were used to examine predictors of PDR. Results: Seventy-seven (16.4%) individuals had PDR (95% CI: 13.2 to 20.0); most resistance was likely TDR since 63% were incident infections. SDRM were present in 9.8% (7.3 to 12.9). Resistance to any NRTI was present in <1% of individuals, while efavirenz resistance was present in 10% (6.9% to 12.4%). TW were not statistically more likely than cis-MSM to have PDR (11.4% vs. 9.1%, p = 0.54). Age, incident versus prevalent infection, or residence district did not predict PDR. Prevalence of SDRM increased from 3% in 2013 to 21% 2017 within incident infections (p = 0.04), but not when including prevalent infections. Conclusions: Prevalence of NNRTI resistance in three studies of ART-naïve MSM and TW in Lima, Peru reaches 10%. Because our study reports PDR in a population in which most acquired HIV recently, the overall prevalence of PDR, including previously treated persons, is likely underestimated. These results underscore the need for a nationally representative survey of PDR in Peru and consideration of non-NNRTI anchored first-line ART options. This study also represents the first evaluation of PDR in cis-MSM versus TW in South America, and demonstrates that, although TW are at higher risk of acquiring HIV, they are at similar risk of acquiring a virus with resistance mutations.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jia2.25411;5.5;6.7;7.1;;e25411;;

We aimed to report the non-inferior efficacy of dolutegravir compared with efavirenz 400 mg at week 96. Methods: We did a multicentre, randomised, open label, phase 3 trial in in three hospitals in Yaoundé, Cameroon, in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral-naive adults with an HIV RNA viral load of greater than 1000 copies per mL to compare dolutegravir 50 mg with efavirenz 400 mg (reference treatment), both combined with lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. The primary endpoint was the proportion with a viral load of less than 50 copies per mL at week 48 (10% non-inferiority margin). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02777229 and is ongoing. Findings: Between July, 2016, and August, 2019, of 820 patients assessed, 613 were randomly assigned to receive at least one dose of study medication, with 310 in the dolutegravir group and 303 in the efavirenz 400 mg group. At week 96 in the intention-to-treat analysis, 229 (74%) of 310 patients receiving dolutegravir and 219 (72%) of 303 patients receiving efavirenz, achieved plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL (difference 1·6%, 95% CI 5·4 to 8·6; p=0.66). Viral load suppression was reached significantly more rapidly in the dolutegravir group (p<0·001). Virological failure (>1000 copies per mL) was observed in 27 patients (eight in the dolutegravir group, among which, three women switched to efavirenz 600 mg because of the dolutegravir teratogeneicity signal, and 19 in the efavirenz 400 mg group). No acquired resistance mutations to dolutegravir were observed against 17 mutations to efavirenz with or without mutations to lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate among the 19 efavirenz 400 mg participants with virological failure. Weight gain was greater in the dolutegravir group (median weight gain, 5·0 kg in the dolutegravir group and 3·0 kg in the efavirenz 400 mg group, p<0·001, and incidence of obesity, 22% in the dolutegravir group and 16% in the efavirenz 400 mg group, p=0·043). The incidence of new WHO HIV-related stage 3 and 4 events was similar in each group (12 [4%] in each group). The two groups had similar rates of serious adverse events (28 [9%] of 310 in the dolutegravir group and 21 [7%] of 303 in the efavirenz 400 mg group). 18 deaths were observed during the 96-week follow-up (eight in the dolutegravir group and ten in the efavirenz 400 mg group). Interpretation: The non-inferior efficacy of the dolutegravir-based regimen and non-emergence of dolutegravir resistance at 96 weeks supports its use as a first-line regimen for antiretroviral-naive adults with HIV-1 infection. Viral load suppression was reached more quickly in the dolutegravir group and weight gain was significantly higher.

Methods: HIV/AIDS patients met the criteria were all enrolled in a 1-year cohort study, in which patients receiving HAART alone were designated as Group A, those receiving HAART in combination with SLFZC were designated as Group B, and those receiving HAART in combination with QDC were designated as Group C, 100 cases in each group. The dose of SLFZC was 1.48 g (4 capsules), 3 times daily, and QDC 1.56 g (4 capsules), 3 times daily. T cell subsets, HIV RNA and HIV-1 drug resistance were detected at enrollment and 1 year after treatment. Patients were followed up every 3 months, during which side-effects and other clinical data were recorded. Results: After 1-year treatment, the median increment in CD4 counts was 165.0, 178.0 and 145.0 cells/L for Group A, B and C, respectively. HIV RNA was undetectable in 94% of patients in Group A, 96% in Group B and 92% in Group C. There were no differences regarding the increment in CD4 counts, HIV RNA and frequency of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations. Two of the 14 suspected side-effect symptoms, i.e. fatigue and dizziness, were lower in Groups B and C than in Group A (P<0.05, respectively) Conclusions: SLFZC and QDC do not have a negative impact on immunological and virological response to HAART; however, these preparations are not as potent in reducing HAART-associated side-effects as anticipated.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11655-019-3156-x;1.9;1.9;2.2;16720415;;;

Methods: ECOVIR was a prospective study aiming to assess whether in patients on combination ART with 4 antiretrovirals for 24 weeks and virally suppressed for 48 weeks, a drug-reduced (DR) regimen could be proposed. The intervention consisted of discontinuing genotypically less susceptible drugs to reach a DR regimen with 3 antiretrovirals. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients maintaining viral suppression at week (W) 24. Results: From 89 eligible individuals for the study, a DR regimen was proposed in 86 (97%) patients, of whom 71 were switched to a DR regimen. Baseline characteristics [median (IQR)] were: age 58 (53-65) years, duration of treatment 24 (21-26) years and viral suppression 8 (6-11) years. The cumulative resistance profile showed full resistance to lamivudine/emtricitabine (91%), abacavir (74%), efavirenz/nevirapine (70%), rilpivirine (56%), darunavir (q24h/q12h) (42%/29%), lopinavir (69%), atazanavir (71%) and raltegravir (24%). The final DR regimen consisted of a two-drug or three-drug regimen in 54 patients (76%) and in 17 patients (24%), respectively. The success rate of a DR regimen at W24 was 93.9% (95% CI 84.4-97.6, Kaplan-Meier estimate). Four patients experienced virological failure (at W4, W8 and W12), all with plasma viral load (pVL) <600 copies/mL and no emergence of resistance mutations. The DR strategy allowed a monthly cost saving of 36%. Conclusions: In experienced patients with high-level resistance, individualized strategies based on expert advice can offer DR regimen options with fewer drug-drug interactions and a significant economic impact while ensuring virological success.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/74/9/2716/5528379;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

Methods: Using data collected in a multicenter clinical trial in Thailand and proportional hazard regression models, we compared the risk of a >25% estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reduction in HIV naïve patients initiating TDF or zidovudine (AZT) containing non-PI regimen. Results: Of 640 patients included in the analysis, 461 (72%) received a TDF-containing regimen for a median 6.7 years and 179 (28%) an AZT-containing regimen for 6.5 years. The risk of a >25% eGFR reduction was not associated with treatment (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84–1.47, P = 0.46). In multivariate analysis, the risk of >25% eGFR reduction form baseline was associated with body weight at baseline (HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.48–3.02 for <48 kg patients and HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.20–2.25 for 48–59.9 kg patients, compared to those with >60 kg, P < 0.001) and hypertension (HR 4.03, 95% CI 2.0–8.0, P < 0.001). The effect of baseline weight on >25% eGFR reduction did not significantly vary with treatment (P = 0.27). Conclusions: The risk of eGFR reduction was not higher on TDF- versus AZT-based non-PI regimens. Although the risk of eGFR reduction was greater for patients of lower body weight, this risk was not significantly increased by TDF.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0163445319302452;8.1;7.5;8.0;01634453;;;

As such, there is strong interest in long-acting antiretroviral (ARV) agents that can be administered less frequently4. Herein, we report GS-CA1, a new archetypal small-molecule HIV capsid inhibitor with exceptional potency against HIV-2 and all major HIV-1 types, including viral variants resistant to the ARVs currently in clinical use. Mechanism-of-action studies indicate that GS-CA1 binds directly to the HIV-1 capsid and interferes with capsid-mediated nuclear import of viral DNA, HIV particle production and ordered capsid assembly. GS-CA1 selects in vitro for unfit GS-CA1-resistant capsid variants that remain fully susceptible to other classes of ARVs. Its high metabolic stability and low solubility enabled sustained drug release in mice following a single subcutaneous dosing. GS-CA1 showed high antiviral efficacy as a long-acting injectable monotherapy in a humanized mouse model of HIV-1 infection, outperforming long-acting rilpivirine. Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential of ultrapotent capsid inhibitors as new long-acting agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0560-x;47.5;48.3;45.9;10788956;;;

Here, we report provincial estimates of undetectable and suppressed viral load among pregnant or breastfeeding women in HIV care in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and associated risk factors. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted as part of a baseline assessment for the CQI-PMTCT study: an ongoing cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effect of continuous quality interventions (CQI) on long-term ART outcomes among pregnant and breastfeeding women (NCT03048669). From November 2016 to June 2018, in each of the 35 Kinshasa provincial health zones (HZ), study teams visited the three busiest maternal and child health clinics, enrolled all HIV-positive pregnant or breastfeeding women (1 year post-delivery) receiving ART, and performed viral load testing. Log binomial models with generalized estimating equations to account for clustering at the HZ level, were used to estimate prevalence ratios comparing participants with undetected (<40 copies/mL) or suppressed (<1000 copies/mL) viral load across levels of individual and site characteristics. Results: Of the 1752 eligible women, 1623 had viral load results available, including 38% who had been on ART for <6 months and 74% were on tenofovir-lamivudine-efavirenz. Viral load was undetectable in 53% of women and suppressed in 62%. Among women who were on ART for 12 months, only 60% and 67% respectively, had undetectable or suppressed viral load. Viral load was undetectable in 53%, 48% and 58% of women testing during pregnancy, at delivery, and in postpartum respectively. In multivariable log binomial models, duration of ART >12 months, older age, being married, disclosure of HIV status, receiving care in an urban health zone or one supported by PEPFAR were all positively associated with viral suppression. Conclusions: The observed high level of detectable viral load suggests that high ART coverage alone without substantial efforts to improve the quality of care for pregnant and breastfeeding women, will not be enough to achieve the goal of virtual elimination of vertical HIV transmission in high-burden and limited resources settings like DRC.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jia2.25376;5.5;6.7;7.1;;e25376;;

We determined drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and evaluated the predictive efficacy of a TLD containing regimen for viremic adolescents and young adults in Harare, Zimbabwe.Methods:We sequenced plasma viral RNA from HIV-1-infected adolescents and young adults on 1st and 2nd-line ART with confirmed virologic failure (viral load >1000 copies/ml) and calculated total genotypic susceptibility scores to current 2nd, 3rd line and DTG regimens.Results:A total of 160 participants were genotyped; 112 (70%) on 1st line and 48 (30%) on 2nd line, median (interquartile range) age 18 (15-19) and duration of ART (interquartile range) was 6 (4-8) years. Major DRMs were present in 94 and 67% of 1st and 2nd-line failures, respectively (P < 0.001). Dual class resistance to nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nonnucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors was detected in 96 (60%) of 1st-line failures; protease inhibitor DRMs were detected in a minority (10%) of 2nd-line failures. A total genotypic susceptibility score of 2 or less may risk protease inhibitor or DTG monotherapy in 11 and 42% of 1st-line failures switching to 2nd-line protease inhibitor and TLD respectively.Conclusion:Among adolescents and young adults, current protease inhibitor-based 2nd-line therapies are poorly tolerated, more expensive and adherence is poor. In 1st-line failure, implementation of TLD for many adolescents and young adults on long-term ART may require additional active drug(s). Drug resistance surveillance and susceptibility scores may inform strategies for the implementation of TLD.";http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201909010-00007;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

Published by BMJ.Objectives We assessed the prevalence and risk factors associated with virological failure among female sex workers living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Kampala, Uganda. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study between January 2015 and December 2016 using routinely collected data at a research clinic providing services to women at high risk of STIs including HIV. Plasma samples were tested for viral load from HIV-seropositive women aged 18 years who had been on ART for at least 6 months and had received adherence counselling. Samples from women with virological failure (1000 copies/mL) were tested for HIV drug resistance by population-based sequencing. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with virological failure. Results Of 584 women, 432 (74%) with a mean age of 32 (SD 6.5) were assessed, and 38 (9%) were found to have virological failure. HIV resistance testing was available for 78% (28/38), of whom 82.1% (23/28) had at least one major drug resistance mutation (DRM), most frequently M184V (70%, 16/23) and K103N (65%, 15/23). In multivariable analysis, virological failure was associated with participant age 18-24 (adjusted OR (aOR)=5.3, 95% CI 1.6 to 17.9), self-reported ART non-adherence (aOR=2.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.8) and baseline CD4+ T-cell count 350 cells/mm 3 (aOR=3.1, 95% CI 1.4 to 7.0). Conclusions A relatively low prevalence of virological failure but high rate of DRM was found in this population at high risk of transmission. Younger age, self-reported ART non-adherence and low CD4+ T-cell count on ART initiation were associated with increased risk of virological failure.;https://sti.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/sextrans-2018-053854;6.0;5.5;6.1;13684973;;;

While variation between subtype C and others has been extensively explored, there has been less emphasis on subtypes common to West Africa. We examined a previously described national survey of pretreatment drug resistance in HIV-1-infected Nigerian children aged ,18months, to explore the association between subtypes and patterns of resistance. Methods: Five hundred and forty-nine dried blood spots, from 15 early infant diagnostic facilities in Nigeria, were amplified and HIV-1 polymerase was sequenced. Four hundred and twenty-four were analysed for surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs). Associations between subtype and SDRMs were evaluated by Fisher's exact test and logistic regression analysis, controlling for geographical region and exposure. Results: Using the sub-subtypes of HIV-1 G defined by Delatorre et al. (PLoS One 2014; 9: e98908) the most common subtypes were CRF02-AG (174, 41.0%), GWA-I (128, 30.2%), GWA-II (24, 5.7%), GCA (11, 2.6%), A (21, 5.0%) and CRF06-cpx (18, 4.2%). One hundred and ninety infants (44.8%) had 1 NNRTI mutation, 92 infants (21.7%) had 1 NRTI mutation and 6 infants (1.4%) had 1 PI mutation. By logistic regression, 67N was more common in GWA-II/GCA than CRF02-AG (OR 12.0, P0.006), as was 70R (OR 23.1, P0.007), 184I/V (OR 2.92, P0.020), the presence of 1 thymidine analoguemutation (TAM) (OR 3.87, P0.014), 1 type 2 TAM (OR 7.61, P0.001) and1 NRTI mutation (OR 3.26, P0.005). Conclusions: This dataset reveals differences among SDRMs by subtype; in particular, between the GWA-II and GCA subclades, compared with CRF02-AG and GWA-I.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/74/1/172/5107801;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

ART was not initiated at this time. Case 2 had a single positive NAAT result at 1 month of age that prompted initiation of ART. Subsequent results were negative and ART was discontinued. Repeat negative NAAT with viral load below the limit of quantification or undetectable continued to be obtained. Shortly after and around weaning, positive NAAT results with high viral load (7.1 and 6.03 log10 copies/ml for Cases 1 and 2, respectively) were observed in both children. Both mothers were treated with tenofovir, emtricitabine and efavirenz during breastfeeding. Testing with ultrasensitive assays on early samples conclusively revealed HIV-1 proviral DNA in Case 1. Testing with ultrasensitive assays after the early period but prior to weaning did not detect HIV in either infant.Conclusion:We hypothesize that breast milk from the mothers of these two rare cases had HIV-specific or nonspecific factors that led to the undetectable results in already infected infants until breastfeeding ended. Our results raise the importance of repeat testing of HIV-exposed breast-fed infants after complete cessation of all breastfeeding.";http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201909010-00009;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

Data Sources: A search using PubMed was conducted (2004 through May 2018) using the following keywords: single tablet regimen AND HIV. Additionally, a PubMed search was conducted for each individual STR using the generic names of the agents. For specific STRs, additional search terms were added to narrow results. Articles were evaluated for content, and additional references were identified from a review of literature citations. Conference abstracts from national and international HIV conferences were also searched. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Studies included were published randomized controlled trials and observational studies that evaluated STR approved since September 2016. Relevant conference abstracts were included if the study design was a randomized controlled trial or observational study pertaining to the STRs included. Data Synthesis: Four new STRs are available, including the first dual antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen for virologically suppressed patients. Of the STRs, only 1 is a new molecular entity, and others include new combinations of existing agents that result in distinct advantages and disadvantages. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: The treatment of HIV-1 continues to improve with new agents developed rapidly. These agents should be analyzed in regard to efficacy, safety, DDIs, and appropriateness for specific patients on an individual basis. Conclusions: STRs and agents in the pipeline continue to simplify ART regimens, increase medication adherence, and minimize toxicities.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1060028018793252;5.7;5.2;4.3;10600280;;;

The goal of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is to suppress HIV-1 replication and reconstitute CD4+ T cells. Here, we report on HIV-infected individuals who had a paradoxical decline in CD4+ T cells despite ART-mediated suppression of plasma HIV-1 load (pVL). We defined such an immunological outcome as extreme immune decline (EXID). METHODS. EXID's clinical and immunological characteristics were compared to immunological responders (IRs), immunological nonresponders (INRs), healthy controls (HCs), and idiopathic CD4+ lymphopenia (ICL) patients. T cell immunophenotyping and assembly/activation of inflammasomes were evaluated by flow cytometry. PBMC transcriptome analysis and genetic screening for pathogenic variants were performed. Levels of cytokines/chemokines were measured by electrochemiluminescence. Luciferase immunoprecipitation system and NK-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays were used to identify anti-lymphocyte autoantibodies. RESULTS. EXIDs were infected with non-B HIV-1 subtypes and after 192 weeks of consistent ART-mediated pVL suppression had a median CD4+ decrease of 157 cells/l, compared with CD4+ increases of 193 cells/l and 427 cells/l in INR and IR, respectively. EXID had reduced naive CD4+ T cells, but similar proportions of cycling CD4+ T cells and HLA-DR+CD38+CD8+ T cells compared with IR and INR. Levels of inflammatory cytokines were also similar in EXID and INR, but the IL-7 axis was profoundly perturbed compared with HC, IR, INR, and ICL. Genes involved in T cell and monocyte/macrophage function, autophagy, and cell migration were differentially expressed in EXID. Two of the 5 EXIDs had autoantibodies causing ADCC, while 2 different EXIDs had an increased inflammasome/caspase-1 activation despite consistently ART-suppressed pVL. CONCLUSIONS. EXID is a distinct immunological outcome compared with previously described INR. Anti-CD4+ T cell autoantibodies and aberrant inflammasome/caspase-1 activation despite suppressed HIV-1 viremia are among the mechanisms responsible for EXID.;https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/127113;0;2.6;5.8;;e127113;;

Objectives: To evaluate the immunovirological response after 12months of ART in newly HIV-1-diagnosed people in Bamako, Mali; to determine primary and acquired resistance rates to antiretroviral drugs; and to evaluate the impact of primary resistance on the efficacy of ART. Patients and methods: One hundred and nineteen HIV-1-infected people (88.2% women; median age 34 years) were enrolled between January and June 2014. HIV-1 RNA loads (Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay) were tested in the blood before and at months 3, 6 and 12 after initiation of ART. Primary and acquired resistances to ART were evaluated by the ViroseqTM HIV-1 genotyping assay. Results: During the study, 8.4% of people died and 37% were lost to follow-up. After 1 year of ART, an undetectable HIV-1 RNA viral load was found in 87.7%of cases. The overall rate of primary drug resistance mutations was 17.5% (3.2%, 15.9% and 0% for NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs, respectively). These mutations were not associated with either higher mortality rates or larger numbers of virological failures. The acquired resistance rate was estimated at 3.1%. Conclusions: Our study showed a high primary resistance level and a huge proportion of people non-adherent to the treatment programme. Reassuringly, almost 90% virological success and a low level of acquired mutations were observed in adherent people at month 12. Reinforced education, regular virological monitoring and early HIV-1 diagnosis may help to improve retention in the care system.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/74/1/165/5115408;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

Viral rebound may be induced from several cellular subsets; however, the majority of proviral DNA has been found in antigen experienced resting CD4+ T cells. To achieve a cure for HIV-1, eradication strategies depend upon both understanding mechanisms that drive HIV-1 persistence as well as sensitive assays to measure the frequency of infected cells after therapeutic interventions. Assays such as the quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) measure HIV-1 persistence during ART by ex vivo activation of resting CD4+ T cells to induce latency reversal; however, recent studies have shown that only a fraction of replication-competent viruses are inducible by primary mitogen stimulation. Previous studies have shown a correlation between the acquisition of effector memory phenotype and HIV-1 latency reversal in quiescent CD4+ T cell subsets that harbor the reservoir. Here, we apply our mechanistic understanding that differentiation into effector memory CD4+ T cells more effectively promotes HIV-1 latency reversal to significantly improve proviral measurements in the QVOA, termed differentiation QVOA (dQVOA), which reveals a significantly higher frequency of the inducible HIV-1 replication-competent reservoir in resting CD4+ T cells.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008074;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;e1008074;;

Methods: We analysed 1710 subjects who started a PI/b in combination with tenofovir or abacavir plus emtricitabine or lamivudine, and compared their virological outcomes with those of 4889 patients who started an NNRTI (predominantly efavirenz), according to the presence of 1 TAM as the sole form of transmitted drug resistance. Results: Participants with 1 TAM comprised predominantly MSM (213 of 269, 79.2%), subjects of white ethnicity (206 of 269, 76.6%) and HIV-1 subtype B infections (234 of 269, 87.0%).

We evaluated the effect of long-term TDF exposure on renal function in a cohort of HIV-1-infected Nigerians between 2006 and 2015. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of renal impairment at different time over 144 weeks of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Results: Data of 4897 patients, median age 42 years (interquartile range: 36-49), and 61% females were analyzed. The prevalence of renal impairment increased from 10% at week 24 to 45% at 144 weeks in TDF-exposed participants compared to an increase from 8% at 24 weeks to 14% at 144 weeks in TDF-unexposed participants. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate exposure predicted the risk of renal impairment at 144 weeks of ART (odds ratio: 2.36; 95% confidence interval: 1.28-4.34). Conclusion: Long-term exposure to TDF-based ART significantly increases the likelihood of renal impairment. The continued use of TDF-based regimen in our setting should be reviewed.

Efforts to characterize the response to first-line treatments in other HIV-1 subtypes have been hindered by the availability of large study cohorts in resource-limited settings. To maximize our statistical power, we combined HIV-1 sequence and clinical data from every available study population associated with the Joint Clinical Research Centre (JCRC) in Uganda. These records were combined with contemporaneous ART-naive records from Uganda in the Stanford HIVdb database. Methods: Treatment failures were defined by the presence of HIV genotype records with sample collection dates after the ART start dates in the JCRC database. Drug resistances were predicted by the Stanford HIVdb algorithm, and HIV subtype classification and recombination detection was performed with SCUEAL. We used Bayesian network analysis to evaluate associations between drug exposures and subtypes, and binomial regression for associations with recombination. Results: This is the largest database of first-line treatment failures ( $$n=1724$$ n = 1724 ) in Uganda to date, with a predicted statistical power of 80% to detect subtype associations at an odds ratio of $$\ge 1.2$$  1.2. In the subset where drug regimen data were available, we observed that use of 3TC was associated with a higher rate of first line treatment failure, whereas regimens containing AZT and TDF were associated with reduced rates of failure. In the complete database, we found limited evidence of associations between HIV-1 subtypes and treatment failure, with the exception of a significantly lower frequency of failures among A/D recombinants that comprised about 7% of the population. First-line treatment failure was significantly associated with reduced numbers of recombination breakpoints across subtypes. Conclusions: Expanding access to first-line ART should confer the anticipated public health benefits in Uganda, despite known differences in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 subtypes. Furthermore, the impact of ART may actually be enhanced by frequent inter-subtype recombination in this region.;https://aidsrestherapy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12981-019-0218-2;3.2;3.8;4.4;;3;;

Since the beginning of HIV-1 virus, several antiviral therapeutic agents have been developed at various stages to combat HIV-1 infection. But, many of antiviral drugs are on the platform of drug resistance and toxicology issues, needs an urgent constructive investigation for the development of productive and protective therapeutics to make an improvement of individual life suffering with viral infection. As developing a novel agent is very costly, challenging and time taking route in the recent times. Methods: The review summarized about the modern approaches of computational aided drug discovery to developing a novel inhibitor within a short period of time and less cost. Results: The outcome suggests on the premise of reported information that the computational drug discovery is a powerful technology to design a defensive and fruitful therapeutic agents to combat HIV-1 infection and recover the lifespan of suffering one. Conclusion: Based on survey of the reported information, we concluded that the current computational approaches is highly supportive in the progress of drug discovery and controlling the viral infection.;http://www.eurekaselect.com/174816/article;5.8;5.3;5.1;13816128;;;

Here We provide a basis for understanding the occurrence and development of HIV-1 resistance in Yunnan and a theoretical foundational for strategy to delay HIV-1 drug resistance and achieve successful individualized treatment. Methods: Plasma samples from different cities/prefectures were collected at Yunnan Provincial Hospital of Infectious Disease from January 2010 to September 2016, and those from drug-resistant individuals were genotyped using in-house assays, 88 patients were selected for the study who had been on treatment for 6 months (and for whom drug resistance was then measured), and each patient had at least 3 genotype resistance tests and who were enrolled to analyze mutation and evolution of HIV resistance. Results: 264 Pol sequences of 88 patients were obtained. Drug resistance levels to eight drugs increased to varying degrees with prolonged treatment. Resistance to efavirenz (EFV) and etravirine (ETR) showed the highest change, comparisons of resistant changes to second and first and to third and second agents showed altered level of drug resistance were 25 and 20 cases, 28 and 18 cases, respectively. The smallest change was Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) present 2 and 3 cases; Resistance to lamivudine (3TC) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) was high among patients detected thrice, whereas other drugs were distributed in all resistance levels. M184 V/I (26.14%), T69S (11.36%), and T215Y/I (10.23%) mutations were the most common in nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and K103 N/R/S (21.59%), V179D/E (20.45%) in Non-NRTIs (NNRTIs). Furthermore, L10 V/F/I (6.82%), A71V (4.55%), and I54V (4.55%) mutations were common in protease inhibitors (PIs). Conclusions: We found dynamic genotypic changes in HIV-1 drug-resistance in Yunnan, with prolonged treatment, and drug resistance was inevitable. However, resistance to different drugs occurred at varying times, and mutation site emergence was the main cause. These findings enhance our understanding of evolution and regulation, and are valuable for developing HIV-1 DR prevention strategies in Yunnan.";https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12985-018-1112-6;4.0;4.2;4.5;;5;;

The primary outcome was sustained HIV-1 viral load (VL) <400 copies/mL at 48 weeks. Results: Of 30 enrolled patients, 28 (93%) achieved viral suppression on LPV/r, while 29 (96%) experienced low-level viremia.

The 48-week efficacy and safety of D/C/F/TAF versus darunavir/cobicistat + emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (control) in treatment-naïve adults were demonstrated in the phase 3 AMBER study. Objective: To describe AMBER outcomes across patient subgroups based on demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline. Methods: AMBER patients had viral load (VL) 1000 copies/mL, CD4+ cell count >50 cells/µL, and genotypic susceptibility to darunavir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with virologic response (VL <50 copies/mL; FDA snapshot). Safety was assessed by adverse events, estimated glomerular filtration rate (cystatin C; eGFRcystC), and bone mineral density. Outcomes were assessed by age (/>50 years), gender, race (black/non-black), baseline VL (/>100,000 copies/mL), baseline CD4+ cell count (</200 cells/µL), and baseline WHO clinical stage of HIV infection (1/2). Results: For the 725 AMBER patients (D/C/F/TAF: 362; control: 363), virologic response rates at week 48 were similar with D/C/F/TAF (91%) and control (88%), and this was consistent across all subgroups. Adverse event rates were similar in both arms, although numerically higher among patients >50 years and women, relative to their comparator groups, regardless of treatment arm (notably, sample sizes were small for patients >50 years and women). Improvements in eGFRcystC and stable bone mineral density were observed with D/C/F/TAF overall, and results were generally consistent across subgroups. Conclusions: For treatment-naïve patients in AMBER, initiating therapy with the D/C/F/TAF single-tablet regimen was an effective and well-tolerated option, regardless of demographic or clinical characteristics.";https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15284336.2019.1608714;0;0;0.1;25787489;;;

All Rights Reserved.There is currently no specific therapeutics for the HIV-1-related central nervous system (CNS) complications. Here we report that three newly designed CNS-targeting HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs), GRL-083-13, GRL-084-13, and GRL-087-13, which contain a P1-3,5-bis-fluorophenyl or P1-para-monofluorophenyl ring, and P2-bis-tetrahydrofuran (bis-THF) or P2-tetrahydropyrano-tetrahydrofuran (Tp-THF), with a sulfonamide isostere, are highly active against wild-type HIV-1 strains and primary clinical isolates (50% effective concentration [EC50], 0.0002 to 0.003 M), with minimal cytotoxicity. These CNS-targeting PIs efficiently suppressed the replication of HIV-1 variants (EC50, 0.002 to 0.047 M) that had been selected to propagate at high concentrations of conventional HIV-1 PIs. Such CNS-targeting PIs maintained their antiviral activity against HIV-2ROD as well as multidrug-resistant clinical HIV-1 variants isolated from AIDS patients who no longer responded to existing antiviral regimens after long-term therapy. Long-term drug selection experiments revealed that the emergence of resistant-HIV-1 against these CNS-targeting PIs was substantially delayed. In addition, the CNS-targeting PIs showed the most favorable CNS penetration properties among the tested compounds, including various FDA-approved anti-HIV-1 drugs, as assessed with the in vitro blood-brain barrier reconstruction system. Crystallographic analysis demonstrated that the bicyclic rings at the P2 moiety of the CNS-targeting PIs form strong hydrogen-bond interactions with HIV-1 protease (PR) active site. Moreover, both the P1-3,5-bis-fluorophenyl and P1-para-monofluorophenyl rings sustain greater van der Waals contacts with PR than in the case of darunavir (DRV). The data suggest that the present CNS-targeting PIs have desirable features for treating patients infected with wild-type and/or multidrug-resistant HIV-1 strains and might serve as promising preventive and/or therapeutic candidates for HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) and other CNS complications.;https://aac.asm.org/content/63/7/e00466-19;7.8;7.9;8.3;00664804;e00466-19;;

We investigated the efficacy of NRTI backbones (tenofovir or abacavir with a cytosine analogue) in low- and middle-income countries where there is significant prior exposure to antiretrovirals and drug resistance to NRTIs. Methods Within the treatment-as-prevention study in South Africa, we selected participants with available next-generation sequencing (NGS) data for the HIV-1 pol gene at trial entry; they were either ART initiators (n = 1193) or already established on ART (n = 94). NGS of the HIV-1 pol gene was carried out using MiSeq technology; reverse transcriptase drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were detected at 5% (DRM 5%) and 20% (DRM 20%) for all 1287 participants. Genotypic susceptibility was assessed using the Stanford HIVDB resistance interpretation algorithm. Results NRTI DRM 20% and DRM 5% were detected among 5/1193 (0.4%) and 9/1193 (0.8%) of ART initiators, respectively. There was tenofovir exposure in 73/94 (77.7%) of those established on ART, with full susceptibility to abacavir in 57/94 (60.6%) and 56/94 (59.6%) for DRM 20% and DRM 5%, respectively, while 67/94 (71.3%) and 64/94 (68.1%) were fully susceptible to tenofovir, respectively. The differences between tenofovir and abacavir were not statistically significant at the 20% or 5% variant level (P = 0.16 and 0.29, respectively). NGS detection of variants at the 5% level increased detection of K65R in both naive and treated groups. One of 607 integrase sequences carried a DRM 20% (Q148R). Conclusions Dolutegravir with a cytosine analogue plus tenofovir or abacavir appears to have similar efficacy in South Africans naive to ART. NGS should be considered in HIV drug resistance surveillance.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/74/2/473/5150591;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

This case series presents the safety and efficacy of ABC/3TC/DTG STR in patients with HIV and ESRD on HD. Patients were included if they were HIV-positive, maintained on intermittent HD for ESRD, switched to an ARV regimen containing ABC/3TC/DTG, and had at least one set of virologic data before and after the switch. Average age (±standard deviation) was 59 (±8) years. The majority of patients were cis-gender male and non-Hispanic Black. Only one demonstrated clinically significant resistance at baseline. All were on multiple-tablet regimens prior to the switch. Five patients (83%) achieved undetectable HIV-RNA after the switch while only four patients (46%) were undetectable immediately prior. No decline in immune function was noted. ABC/3TC/DTG STR was well tolerated. Only one patient self-reported an adverse event (nausea), which resolved without drug discontinuation. Based on these data, it appears that ABC/3TC/DTG may be a safe and effective ARV-STR option for patients with HIV and ESRD on HD. A larger trial including a PK analysis is needed to confirm these findings.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956462418800865;2.5;2.5;2.7;09564624;;;

Background: In Senegal in 2015, an estimated 4800 children were living with HIV, with 1200 receiving ARV treatment, of whom half had follow-up care in decentralized sites outside Dakar. However, until now no studies have determined the efficacy of pediatric treatment in decentralized settings, even though the emergence of viral resistance, particularly among children in Africa, is a well-known phenomenon. This study aimed to assess the virological status of HIV-infected children in all decentralized facilities to help improve access to quality care. Methods: A cross-sectional epidemiological and virological study was conducted in all of Senegal's regions, except Dakar, between March and June 2015 and sought to include all HIV-infected children and adolescents (0-19 years), treated or not with ARVs. Socio-demographic and clinical data and a blood sample on blotting paper were collected for children from treatment sites. Samples were routed on public transportation, assisted by a network of community health workers. A viral load (VL) assay was performed for each child, followed by genotyping when it exceeded 1000 copies/mL (3 log 10 ). Results: Of the 851 identified children, 666 (78%) were enrolled in the study. Half of the children were girls, and the average age was 8 years (6 months-19 years). Most of the children (96.7%) were infected with HIV-1, and 90% were treated with ART, primarily with AZT + 3TC + NVP/EFV therapeutic regimen. The median duration of time on ART was 21 months (1-129). VL was measured for 2% of children before this study. Almost two-thirds (64%) of the children are experiencing virological failure. Among them, there was resistance to at least one drug for 86.5% of cases. Also, 25% children presented resistance to one drug and 40% to two out of three. For nearly one-third of the children presenting resistance, none of the three drugs of the treatment was active. Factors associated with virological failure were male sex, follow-up by a generalist rather than a specialist, and treatment interruptions. Conclusions: We observed a high level of virological failure and a high percentage of viral resistance among children receiving health care in decentralized facilities in Senegal.;https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-019-1420-z;4.1;3.1;2.5;;47;;

Doravirine (DOR), a novel non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), is active against wild-type Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 and the most common NNRTI-resistant variants, and has a favorable and unique in vitro resistance profile. Methods. DRIVE-AHEAD is a phase 3, double-blind, non-inferiority trial. Antiretroviral treatment.naive adults with .1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL were randomized (1:1) to once-daily, fixed-dose DOR at 100 mg, lamivudine at 300 mg, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) at 300 mg (DOR/3TC/TDF) or to efavirenz at 600 mg, emtricitabine at 200 mg, and TDF at 300 mg (EFV/ FTC/TDF) for 96 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants with 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL at week 48 (Food and Drug Administration snapshot approach; non-inferiority margin 10%). Results. Of the 734 participants randomized, 728 were treated (364 per group) and included in the analyses. At week 48, 84.3% (307/364) of DOR/3TC/TDF recipients and 80.8% (294/364) of EFV/FTC/TDF recipients achieved 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL (difference 3.5%, 95% CI, -2.0, 9.0). DOR/3TC/TDF recipients had significantly lower rates of dizziness (8.8% vs 37.1%), sleep disorders/disturbances (12.1% vs 25.2%), and altered sensorium (4.4% vs 8.2%) than EFV/FTC/TDF recipients. Mean changes in fasting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) were significantly different between DOR/3TC/TDF and EFV/FTC/TDF (.1.6 vs +8.7 mg/dL and .3.8 vs +13.3 mg/dL, respectively). Conclusions. In HIV-1 treatment-naive adults, DOR/3TC/TDF demonstrated non-inferior efficacy to EFV/FTC/TDF at week 48 and was well tolerated, with significantly fewer neuropsychiatric events and minimal changes in LDL-C and non.HDL-C compared with EFV/FTC/TDF.

We assessed safety and efficacy of dolutegravir compared with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in adults in whom previous first-line antiretroviral therapy with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) plus two NRTIs has failed. Methods: DAWNING is a phase 3b, open-label, parallel-group, non-inferiority, active-controlled trial done at 58 sites in 13 countries. Eligible adults were aged at least 18 years and, during at least 6 months of treatment with a first-line treatment containing an NNRTI and two NRTIs, had virological failure (confirmed HIV-1 RNA 400 copies per mL). Participants were randomly assigned by a central randomisation system to receive oral dolutegravir (50 mg once daily) or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (800 mg lopinavir plus 200 mg ritonavir once daily or 400 mg plus 100 mg twice daily), plus two investigator-selected NRTIs (at least one fully active based on resistance testing at screening). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants achieving viral suppression (defined as plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) at week 48 using the snapshot algorithm and a non-inferiority margin of 12%. The primary analysis was done in an intention-to-treat-exposed (ITT-E) population of participants who received at least one dose of study medication, according to original group assignment. Safety was analysed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug, according to which drug was received. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02227238, and viiv-studyregister.com, number 200304. Findings: Between Dec 11, 2014, and June 27, 2016, 968 adults were screened and 627 were randomly assigned to the dolutegravir group (n=312) or the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group (n=315). Three patients in the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group did not receive study medication and so 624 were included in the ITT-E population. At week 48, 261 (84%) of 312 participants in the dolutegravir group achieved viral suppression compared with 219 (70%) of 312 in the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group (adjusted difference 13·8%; 95% CI 7·3–20·3). Non-inferiority was achieved on the basis of the 95% CI of the adjusted treatment difference having a lower bound greater than 12% (prespecified non-inferiority margin). Because the lower bound of the 95% CI is greater than zero (7·3%), superiority of dolutegravir was also concluded (p<0·0001). The safety profile for dolutegravir was favourable compared with that of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir. More grade 2–4 drug-related adverse events occurred with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir than dolutegravir (44 [14%] of 310 with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir vs 11 [4%] of 314 with dolutegravir), mainly driven by gastrointestinal disorders. Interpretation: When administered with two NRTIs, dolutegravir was superior to ritonavir-boosted lopinavir at 48 weeks and can be considered a suitable option for second-line treatment.

The objective of this study was to investigate the noninferiority of the TDF/FTC/EFV fixed-dose combination on alternate-days versus standard regimen in virologically suppressed patients.Design:A randomized-controlled open-label noninferiority trial enrolling HIV-1-infected patients treated for at least 6 months with TDF/FTC/EFV fixed-dose combination, virologically suppressed (<40 HIV-RNA copies/ml) with EFV plasma concentrations greater than 1000ng/ml, were randomized to maintain TDF/FTC/EFV standard-of-care regimen (SOC, Arm A) or to switch to TDF/FTC/EFV on AlTernAte Days (ATAD, Arm B).Methods:Primary end-point was the proportion of patients with less than 40 HIV-RNA copies/ml at week 48.Results:One hundred and ninety-seven patients were randomized (98 in the SOC and 99 in the ATAD arm). One hundred and seventy-nine (90.3%) were men, median age 43.2 years, 133 (67.5%) MSM. CD4+ T-cell count at baseline was 706 cells/l in SOC and 632 cells/l in ATAD arm. At week 48, 95 (96.9%) patients in SOC and 93 (93.9%) in ATAD had a virological response (-3.0% overall risk difference, 95% CI: -8.86%/2.86%). Median change from baseline at week 48 in CD4+ T-cell count was 29.4 cells/l (95% CI: 2.5/56.4) in SOC (P=0.008) and 61.0 cells/l (95% CI: 32.1/89.9) in ATAD (P<0.001). Median change of EFV concentration at week 48 from baseline was -6.5ng/ml (95% CI: -103/55) in SOC (P=0.877) and -1124ng/ml (95% CI: -1375/-928) in ATAD arm (P<0.001).Conclusion:Despite a significant decrease of EFV exposure, TDF/FTC/EFV on ATAD was noninferior to SOC regimen through 48 weeks.;http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201903010-00017;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

Data sources PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature from March 2001 to December 2016 (updated search in PubMed and EMBASE up to June 2018); and reference lists of eligible studies and related reviews. Study selection Randomised controlled trials comparing quadruple with triple combination antiretroviral therapies in treatment naive people with HIV and evaluating at least one effectiveness or safety outcome. Review methods Outcomes of interest included undetectable HIV-1 RNA, CD4 T cell count, virological failure, new AIDS defining events, death, and severe adverse effects. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted. Results Twelve trials (including 4251 people with HIV) were eligible. Quadruple and triple combination antiretroviral therapies had similar effects on all relevant effectiveness and safety outcomes, with no point estimates favouring quadruple therapy. With the triple therapy as the reference group, the risk ratio was 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.05) for undetectable HIV-1 RNA, 1.00 (0.90 to 1.11) for virological failure, 1.17 (0.84 to 1.63) for new AIDS defining events, 1.23 (0.74 to 2.05) for death, and 1.09 (0.89 to 1.33) for severe adverse effects. The mean difference in CD4 T cell count increase between the two groups was -19.55 cells/L (-43.02 to 3.92). In general, the results were similar, regardless of the specific regimens of combination antiretroviral therapies, and were robust in all subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Conclusion In this study, effects of quadruple combination antiretroviral therapy were not better than triple combination antiretroviral therapy in treatment naive people with HIV. This finding lends support to current guidelines recommending the triple regimen as first line treatment. Further trials on this topic should be conducted only when new research is justified by adequate systematic reviews of the existing evidence. However, this study cannot exclude the possibility that quadruple cART would be better than triple cART when new classes of antiretroviral drugs are made available.";https://www.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmj.l4179;10.6;8.7;6.5;09598146;l4179;;

All rights reserved.There are no standardized criteria to characterize confirmed protocol-defined virological failure (PDVF) nor the inclusion criteria for the resistance analysis population (RAP) in Phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of initial antiretroviral therapy (ART). We assessed the clinical impact of mismatching between virological non-response (HIV-1 RNA 50 copies/mL), confirmed PDVF (48 weeks), and RAP definition in studies with the newest first-line ART. A systematic review of all Phase III RCTs was performed, including preferred once-daily ART (EACS European AIDS guidelines) or recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. We identified 16 treatment arms (14 RCTs) with 6175 participants treated with dolutegravir, bictegravir, elvitegravir/cobicistat, raltegravir, darunavir/cobicistat, rilpivirine, or doravirine. Plasma HIV-1 RNA thresholds for PDVF or RAP ranged from 40 to 50, 200, 400, and 500 copies/mL. This led to discrepancies between trials regarding the participants defined as virological non-responders, PDVF, or included in RAP. Overall, 85/296 (29%) patients with PDVF were not genotyped. There was a linear correlation between the threshold of HIV RNA chosen to perform genotyping and rates of participants with PDVF but not genotyped. Only eight treatment arms genotyped all participants with PDVF. Most of the remaining eight arms genotyped roughly < 50% of those with PDVF. In summary, the absence of standardized definitions of VF and criteria for resistance testing in pivotal Phase III RCTs of the first-line ART leads to the possibility of underreporting of resistance mutations when genotypes are only performed at higher viral load cutoffs. Stringent homogeneous criteria should be defined to ensure that all participants with PDVF (e.g., confirmed HIV RNA  50 copies/mL and the second > 200 copies/mL) undergo genotyping.;http://www.aidsreviews.com/resumen.php?id=1440;4.0;3.4;3.1;11396121;;;

We hypothesized that these options would have similar efficacy to triple ART. Methods: We used an open-label non-inferiority randomized controlled trial comprising two phases: phase A was established to test that experimental arms did not have an unacceptable (5%) failure rate; phase B was intended to include the full number of patients followed for 48 weeks. Treated HIV-1-infected adults with viral load, 50 copies/mL for 12months, no prior viral failure or resistance mutations to study drugs, nadir CD4.200 cells/mm3, and hepatitis B virus surface antigen negative were randomized 1:1:1 to maintain triple therapy (control arm), or to switch to dolutegravir/lamivudine, or to dolutegravir monotherapy stratifying by anchor drug. Premature discontinuation was considered if viral failure or therapy interruption due to adverse events, concurrent illness, protocol deviation or patient's wish occurred. Blips were registered. Planned phase A results at 24 weeks are reported here. The study is registered at EudraCT: 201500027435. Results: Ninety-one (control, n=31; dual therapy, n=29; monotherapy, n=31) patients were randomized. Three patients (none previously exposed to integrase inhibitors) prematurely discontinued treatment due to viral failure: dolutegravir/lamivudine (n=1), no resistance mutations (subject A); dolutegravir (n=2), N155H, S147G and Q148R resistance mutations (subject B), and E138K, G140S and N155H resistance mutations (subject C). There were no discontinuations for other reasons. One patient (dolutegravir/lamivudine) experienced a blip in viral load. The Data Safety Monitoring Board recommended stopping the dolutegravir monotherapy arm. Conclusions: In contrast to dolutegravir/lamivudine, a higher than expected risk of viral failure with development of cross-resistance integrase mutations occurred with dolutegravir maintenance monotherapy.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/73/7/1965/4955975;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

We therefore analysed baseline predictors of first-line ART outcome after 6 and 12 months. Material and methods 874 HIV-infected patients, who started first-line ART, were enrolled in a countrywide prospective cohort. Two outcomes were defined: i) treatment failure: detectable viremia or lost-to-follow-up (LTFU) (confirmed death, moved from study sites or similar reasons); ii) LTFU only. Using stepwise logistic regression, four multivariable models identified baseline predictors for odds of treatment failure and LTFU. Results The treatment failure rates were 23.3% and 33.9% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Opportunistic infections (OI), tuberculosis (TB), CD4 cells <50/l, and viral load >5 log10 copies/ ml increased the odds of treatment failure both at 6 and 12 months. The odds of LTFU at month 6 increased with baseline functional disabilities, WHO stage III/IV, and CD4 cells <50/l. TB also increased the odds at month 12. Importantly, ART outcome differed across hospitals. Compared to the national hospital in Addis Ababa, patients from most regional sites had higher odds of treatment failure and/or LTFU at month 6 and/or 12, with the exception of one clinic (Jimma), which had lower odds of failure at month 6. Conclusions In this first countrywide Ethiopian HIV cohort, a high ART failure rate was identified, to the largest extent due to LTFU, including death. The geographical region where the patients were treated was a strong baseline predictor of ART failure. The difference in ART outcome across hospitals calls the need for provision of more national support at regional level.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200505;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0200505;;

However, there is limited information about the roles of the brain and its cell types as a potential sanctuary for this subtype and how the sanctuary may be affected by the administration of anti-retroviral therapy (ART). To address this issue, we collected postmortem brain tissues from ART treated HIV-1 infected Zambian individuals who experienced complete viral suppression and those who did not. Tissues from various brain compartments were collected from each individual as frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded brain specimens, for detection and quantification of HIV-1 genomes and identification of the infected cell type. Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted from frozen brain tissues. The extracted DNA and RNA were then subjected to droplet digital PCR for HIV-1 quantification. RNA/DNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) for HIV-1 was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded brain tissues in conjugation with immunohistochemistry to identify the infected cell types. Droplet digital PCR revealed that HIV-1 gag DNA and RNA were detectable in half of the cases studied regardless of ART success or failure. The presence of HIV-1 lacked specific tissue compartmentalization since detection was random among various brain tissues. When combined with immunohistochemistry, RNA/DNAscope ISH demonstrated co-localization of HIV-1 DNA with CD68 expressing cells indicative of microglia or peripheral macrophage. Our study showed that brain is a potential sanctuary for subtype C HIV-1, as HIV-1 can be detected in the brain of infected individuals irrespective of ART treatment outcome and no compartmentalization of HIV-1 to specific brain compartments was evident.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0201325;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0201325;;

We aimed to develop and validate a predictive model to evaluate in-hospital mortality risk in HIV/AIDS patients with PCP in China. 1001 HIV/AIDS patients with PCP admitted in the Beijing Ditan hospital from August 2009 to January 2018 were included in this study. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify independent risk factors of death, and a predictive model was devised based on risk factors. The overall in-hospital mortality was 17.3%. The patients were randomly assigned into derivation cohort (801cases) and validation cohort (200 cases) in 8:2 ratio, respectively, in which in derivation cohort we found that 7 predictors, including LDH >350U/L, HR>130 times/min, room air PaO 2 <70mmHg, later admission to ICU, Anemia (HGB90g/L), CD4<50cells/ul, and development of a pneumothorax, were associated with poor prognosis in HIV/AIDS patients with PCP and were included in the predictive model. The model had excellent discrimination with AUC of 0.904 and 0.921 in derivation and validation cohort, respectively. The predicted scores were divided into two groups to assess the in-hospital mortality risk: low-risk group (0-11 points with mortality with 2.15-12.77%) and high-risk group (12-21 points with mortality with 38.78%-81.63%). The cumulative mortality rate also indicated significant difference between two groups with Kaplan-Meier curve (p<0.001). A predictive model to evaluate mortality in HIV/AIDS patients with PCP was constructed based on routine laboratory and clinical parameters, which may be a simple tool for physicians to assess the prognosis in HIV/AIDS patients with PCP in China.;https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/6057028/;5.1;4.3;3.6;23146133;6057028;;

Patients and methods: A large PDR survey was implemented in Mexico (September 2017-March 2018) across eight sub-regions. All larger clinics (which provide ART to 90% of all initiators) were included, allocating sample size using the probability-proportional-to-size method. Both antiretroviral-naive and prior antiretroviral-exposed persons were included. HIV PDR levels were estimated from pol Sanger sequences obtained at a WHOdesignated laboratory. Results: A total of 2006 participants were enrolled from 74 clinics. PDR to NNRTIs was higher than to other drug classes (P <0.0001), crossing the 10% threshold in the North-East, East, South-West and South-East. NNRTI PDR was higher in the South-West (P=0.02), coinciding with the highest proportion of restarters in this sub-region (14%). We observed higher PDR prevalence to any drug in women compared with men (16.5% versus 12.2%, P=0.04). After multivariable adjustment, higher NNRTI PDR remained significantly associated with previous antiretroviral exposure in the Centre-North, North-West, South-West and South- East [adjusted OR (aOR): 21, 5, 8 and 25, respectively; P<0.05]. Genetic network analyses showed high assortativity by sub-region (P <0.0001), with evidence of drug resistance mutation transmission within local clusters. Conclusions: Diversification of the public health response to HIV drug resistance based on sub-regional characteristics could be considered in Mexico. Higher NNRTI PDR levels were associated with poorer regions, suggesting opportunities to strengthen local HIV programmes.

We sought to describe correlates of PDR and evaluate effects of PDR on clinical outcomes in rural Uganda. We analyzed data from the Uganda AIDS Rural Treatment Outcomes study, a cohort of antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive adults with HIV (2005-2015). We performed resistance testing on pre-ART specimens. We defined PDR as any World Health Organization (WHO) 2009 surveillance drug resistance mutation and classified PDR level using the Stanford algorithm. We fit unadjusted and sex-stratified log binomial regression and Cox proportional hazard models to identify correlates of PDR and the impact of PDR on viral suppression, loss to follow-up (LTFU), and death. We analyzed data from 738 participants (median age 33 years, 69% female). Overall, prevalence of PDR was 3.5% (n = 26), owing mostly to resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. PDR increased over time in women (1.8% in those enrolling in clinic in 2001-2006, vs. 7.0% in 2007-2013; p = 0.006), but not in men (1.15% vs. 0.72%, p = 0.737). Lower pre-ART log10 HIV RNA was also associated with higher prevalence of PDR. We identified longer time to viral suppression among those with PDR compared with without PDR (0.5 and 0.3 years, respectively, p = 0.023), but there was no significant relationship with mortality or LTFU (p = 0.139). We observed increasing rates of PDR in women in southwestern Uganda. Implications of this trend, particularly to prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs in the region, require attention due to delayed viral suppression among those with PDR.";http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/apc.2018.0020;6.2;6.6;6.0;10872914;;;

WHO guidelines for these regions define failure of ART with a lenient threshold of viraemia (HIV RNA viral load 1000 copies per mL). We investigated the occurrence of detectable viraemia during ART below this threshold and its effect on treatment outcomes in a large South African cohort. Methods: In this observational cohort study, we included HIV-positive adults registered between Jan 1, 2007, and May 1, 2016, at 57 clinical sites in South Africa, who were receiving WHO-recommended ART regimens and viral load monitoring. Low-level viraemia was defined as the occurrence of at least one viral load measurement of 51–999 copies per mL during ART. Outcomes were WHO-defined virological failure (one or more viral load measurement of 1000 copies per mL) and switch to second-line ART. Risks were estimated with Cox proportional hazard models. Findings: 70 930 patients were included in the analysis, of whom 67 644 received first-line ART, 1476 received second-line ART, and 1810 received both. Median duration of follow-up was 124 weeks (IQR 56–221) for patients on first-line ART and 101 weeks (IQR 51–178) for patients on second-line ART. Low-level viraemia occurred in 16 013 (23%) of 69 454 patients, with an incidence of 11·5 per 100 person-years of follow-up (95% CI 11·4–11·7), during first-line ART. Virological failure during follow-up occurred in 14 380 (22%) of 69 454 patients on first-line ART. Low-level viraemia was associated with increased hazards of virological failure (hazard ratio [HR] 2·6, 95% CI 2·5–2·8; p<0·0001) and switch to second-line ART (HR 5·2, 4·4–6·1; p<0·0001]) compared with virological suppression of less than 50 copies per mL. Risk of virological failure increased further with higher ranges and persistence of low-level viraemia. Interpretation: In this large cohort, low-level viraemia occurred frequently and increased the risk of virological failure and switch to second-line ART. Strategies for management of low-level viraemia need to be incorporated into WHO guidelines to meet UNAIDS-defined targets aimed at halting the global HIV epidemic.

The median HIV viral load and CD4 cell count were 65 210 copies/mL (IQR, 8728-208 920 copies/mL) and 201 cells/mm3 (IQR, 49-333 cells/mm3). Major PI resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) were demonstrated in 44 (51%) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor RAMs in 72 patients (83%) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors RAMs in 62 patients (72%). PI resistance was associated with age >24 years (P = .003) and CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm3 (P = .007). In multivariable analysis, only age >24 years was significantly associated (adjusted odds ratio, 4.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.69-13.38; P = .003) with major PI mutations. Third-line DRV/r- and InSTI-based therapy achieved virologic suppression in 29/36 patients (81%) after 6 months. Conclusions. The prevelance of PI mutations was high. Adolescents and young adults had a lower risk of acquiring major PI resistance mutations, possibly due to poor adherence to ART. Third-line treatment with a regimen of Darunavir/r, Raltegravir/ Dolutegravir, and optimized nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was effective.";https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofy005/4835575;3.5;4.6;3.8;;ofy005;;

However, combining fixed-dose combination tablets such as tenofovir–disoproxil–fumarate, emtricitabine, and cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir (TDF/FTC/EVG/cobi) with darunavir (DRV) can provide a simple, once-daily (QD), 2-tablet regimen for patients with drug-resistant HIV. Primary objective was to determine the percentage of patients with HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL at 48 weeks. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients initiated on TDF/FTC/EVG/cobi plus DRV. Results: Among the 21 included patients, prior resistance showed a median of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations, 1 nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase mutation, and 1 protease inhibitor mutation. At week 48, 14 (67%) patients achieved HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL, 1 patient experienced viral rebound, and 6 (29%) had missing data or discontinued therapy. No patient discontinued for adverse events. Conclusion: According to this observational study, QD TDF/FTC/EVG/cobi plus DRV is considered safe, well tolerated, and generally effective in suppressing HIV drug-resistant virus.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2325957417752260;2.3;2.3;1.8;23259574;;;

Persistence of plasma HIV-1 RNA during seemingly effective antiretroviral thereapy (ART) is incompletely understood. Using an ultrasensitive assay, this cross-sectional study investigated residual plasma HIV-1 RNA in subjects maintained on firstline ART with continuous viral load suppression < 50 copies/mL for 15 years without recognized viral load blips or treatment interruptions and explored its relationship with the duration of suppressive ART, efavirenz concentrations in plasma, 2-LTR circular HIV-1 DNA (2-LTRc DNA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and cellular (CD4 plus CD26/CD38/CD69; CD8 plus CD38/ HLA-DR/DP/DQ) and soluble (sCD14, sCD27, sCD30, IL-6) markers of immune activation in peripheral blood. Methods. Residual plasma HIV-1 RNA, total HIV-1 DNA and 2-LTRc DNA were quantified by real-time and digital droplet PCR. Cellular (CD4 plus CD26/CD38/CD69; CD8 plus CD38/HLA-DR/DP/DQ) and soluble (sCD14, sCD27, sCD30, IL-6) markers of immune activation were measured by flow cytometry and ELISA. Results. Residual plasma HIV-1 RNA and 2-LTRc DNA were detected in 52/104 (50%) and 24/104 (23%) subjects, respectively. Among subjects with detectable HIV-1 RNA, 50/52 showed levels 11 copies/mL. In adjusted analyses, HIV-1 RNA levels were 0.37 log10 copies/mL higher with each log10 U/mL increase in sCD27 (95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.73; P = .02). No significant association was found between residual plasma HIV-1 RNA and other explored parameters. Conclusions. These findings point to an ongoing relationship between plasma HIV-1 RNA and selected markers of immune activation during continuously suppressive ART. The novel direct association with levels of sCD27 warrants further investigation.";https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofy032/4837293;3.5;4.6;3.8;;ofy032;;

In Thailand, data regarding the prevalence of non-AIDS comorbidities and factors associated with metabolic complications in HIV-infected patients have not been well-documented. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2011 and included 874 HIV-infected patients. Results: The age of patients was 45(8) years represented as mean (standard deviation [SD]). The current CD4 count was 502(247) cells/mm3. In all, 388 (44%) of the included patients had at least 1non-AIDS comorbidity. The most frequently documented comorbidities were hyperlipidemia in 271 (70%) patients. Using multivariate analysis, older age(odds ratio [OR] = 1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.51-2.19), male sex (OR = 1.55, 95%CI = 1.14-2.11), high current CD4 count(OR = 1.00, 95%CI = 1.00-1.00), and taking abacavir (ABC)-containing(OR = 2.59, 95%CI = 1.16-5.78)and didanosine (ddI)-containing antiretroviral regimens (OR = 4.16, 95%CI = 1.09-15.84)were associated with the presence of metabolic complications (all Ps<.05). Conclusion: The prevalence of comorbidities is substantially high. Clinical monitoring and effective management of these comorbidities and metabolic complications are recommended, especially in HIV-infected patients who present with these associated factors.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2325957417752256;2.3;2.3;1.8;23259574;;;

Despite the remarkable worldwide progress for universal access to antiretroviral during the last decade, the pediatric population remains fragile due to lack of randomized studies, inappropriate antiretroviral formulations, adherence difficulties, drug toxicity and development of resistance. Areas covered: This review summarizes the latest recommendations and advances for the treatment of HIV-infected children and highlights the potential complications of a lifelong antiretroviral treatment initiated early in life. Expert opinion: International guidelines recommend to start combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) as fast as possible in all children diagnosed with HIV-1. The principal goal is to improve survival and reduce mortality as well as rapidly decrease HIV reservoirs. This remains a challenge in resource-limited settings were diagnostic tools and treatment access may be limited. Different new strategies are in the pipeline such as immunotherapy in combination with very early cART initiation to seek remission or functional cure. For the time being and awaiting for long term remission or cure, there is a need for further pharmacokinetics studies, more pediatric formulations with improved palatability and implementation of randomized trials for the newer antiretroviral drugs.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14656566.2017.1377181;5.7;5.6;4.9;14656566;;;

In the present study, we determined prevalence of MS and its association with oxidative deoxy nucleic acid (DNA) damage in HIV-1 infected patients with different ART status. We used plasma level of the oxidized base, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), as a biomarker of oxidative DNA damage. To measure plasma 8-OHdG we used 8-OHdG enzyme-linked, immunosorbent assay. The biomarkers of MS were insulin resistance, Cholesterol/HDL ratio, Waist circumference and Hypertension. MS and oxidative DNA damage were significantly higher in HIV-positive patients with second line ART and first line ART than ART-naive patients. In a logistic regression analysis, increased MS was positively associated with the increased DNA damage (OR: 29.68, 95%:13.47, CI: 65.40) P = 0.0001. ART plays a significant role in the development of MS and oxidative DNA damage in HIV-positive patients taking antiretroviral therapy. Awareness and knowledge of MS and DNA damage in HIV/AIDS patients may prove helpful to clinicians to manage non-AIDS diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. To determine exact role of ART in induction of MS and DNA damage larger studies are warranted.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12291-017-0670-5;2.2;2.4;2.1;09701915;;;

All rights reserved.Purpose of review In an era when virological efficacy approaches 100%, novel antiretroviral (ARV) therapies must deliver better tolerability, safety, and convenient coformulated regimens. We review the phase II and III clinical data on the fixed dose combination (FDC) darunavir (DRV) 800mg / cobicistat (COBI/C) 150 mg / emtricitabine (F/FTC) 200 mg / tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) 10mg (D/C/F/TAF) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Recent findings In an exploratory phase II study, D/C/F/TAF FDC demonstrated similar virological efficacy to darunavir/cobicistat FDC+F /tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) FDC in treatment-naive HIV-1-infected individuals with favorable bone and renal outcomes. These findings led to two subsequent international phase III double-blind randomized controlled trials; AMBER and EMERALD. In the (treatment naïve) AMBER study, D/C/F/TAF FDC was noninferior to component regimen F/TDF+darunavir/cobicistat with favorable bone and renal outcomes at week 48. In the EMERALD study (switch study for virologically suppressed patients), D/C/F/TAF showed noninferior efficacy to F/TDF and boosted protease inhibitor (bPI) regimen at week 48 also with favorable renal and bone outcomes. No virological failure was observed, and no resistance to TDF or darunavir emerged in either study. Summary In clinical trials, D/C/F/TAF FDC demonstrated excellent, noninferior virological efficacy, maintained a high genetic barrier and conferred the additional safety benefits of TAF. As the first one pill, once daily, protease inhibitor-based regimen, D/C/F/TAF FDC offers a new option for the treatment of HIV infection.";https://journals.lww.com/01222929-201807000-00007;7.5;7.2;7.8;1746630X;;;

HIV Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British HIV AssociationObjectives: Studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of the fixed-dose combination ledipasvir (LDV)/sofosbuvir (SOF) in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) have mainly included treatment-naïve patients without cirrhosis. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this combination in treatment-experienced patients with and without cirrhosis. Methods: We conducted a multicentre, open-label, double-arm, nonrandomized study in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HCV genotype 1 with and without cirrhosis, who had good viral suppression on their antiretroviral regimens. All patients were pretreated with a first-generation NS3/4A protease inhibitor (PI) plus pegylated interferon/ribavirin. Patients received a fixed-dose combination of LDV/SOF for 12 weeks, or for 24 weeks if cirrhosis was present. The primary endpoint was a sustained virological response (SVR) 12 weeks after the end of therapy. Secondary endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics and patient-reported outcomes. Results: Of the 68 patients enrolled, 39.7% had cirrhosis. Sixty-five patients [95.6%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 87.6–99.1%; P < 0.0001] achieved an SVR, with similar rates of SVR in those with and without cirrhosis. Tolerance was satisfactory, with mainly grade 1 or 2 adverse events. Among patient-reported outcomes, only fatigue significantly decreased at the end of treatment compared with baseline [odds ratio (OR): 0.36; 95% CI: 0.14–0.96; P = 0.04]. Mean tenofovir area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) at week 4 was high, with mean ± SD AUC variation between baseline and week 4 higher in cirrhotic than in noncirrhotic patients (3261.57 ± 1920.47 ng/mL vs. 1576.15 ± 911.97 ng/mL, respectively; P = 0.03). Mild proteinuria (54.4%), hypophosphataemia (50.0%), blood bicarbonate decrease (29.4%) and hypokalaemia (13.2%) were reported. The serum creatinine level was not modified.

We retrospectively reviewed genotype data from paired samples in a cohort of HIV-1-infected Nigerian patients failing first-line antiretroviral therapies containing zidovudine (AZT) or tenofovir (TDF). Samples for each patient were taken at initial confirmed virological failure 1000 copies/ml (S1) and then at the latest available sample with viral load 1000 copies/ml before switch to second line (S2). Among 103 patients failing AZT, 19 (18.4%) had TAM-1s, 29 (28.2%) TAM-2s, and 21 (20.4%) mixed TAMs by S2. In contrast, in the 87 patients failing TDF, drug resistance mutations at S2 included K65R in 56 (64.4%), TAM-1s in 1 (1.1%), and TAM-2s in 25 patients (28.7%). Interestingly, 30.4% of patients with K65R in our study developed TAMs. These were exclusively K219E ± D67N and were not predicted to confer a resistance cost to future AZT-containing regimens.;http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2017.0198;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

We measured alveolar CD4+ T cell immune responses following stimulation with pneumococcal cell culture supernatant using flow cytometry-based intracellular cytokine staining. Results: We found that the proportion of alveolar CD4+ T cells producing IL-17A following stimulation with pneumococcal cell culture supernatant (CCS) was similar between HIV-uninfected controls and ART-naïve HIV-infected adults (0.10% vs. 0.14%; p = 0.9273).

All rights reserved.Purpose: Little information is available on patients on antiretroviral treatment (ART) after a long-term period from sub-Saharan Africa, with the longest follow-up and related outcomes being after 10 years on ART. At the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) (Kampala, Uganda), we set up a cohort of patients already on ART for 10 years at the time of enrolment, who will be followed up for additional 10 years. Participants: A prospective observational cohort of 1000 adult patients previously on ART for 10 years was enrolled between May 2014 and September 2015. Patients were eligible for enrolment if they were in their consecutive 10th year of ART regardless of the combination of drugs for both first- and second-line ART. Data were collected at enrolment and all annual study visits. Follow-up visits are scheduled once a year for 10 years. Biological samples (packed cells, plasma and serum) are stored at enrolment and follow-up visits. Findings to date: Out of 1000 patients enrolled, 345 (34.5%) originate from a pre-existing research cohort at IDI, while 655 (65.5%) were enrolled from the routine clinic. Overall, 81% of the patients were on first line at the time of the enrolment in the ART long-term cohort, with the more frequent regimen being zidovudine plus lamivudine plus nevirapine (44% of the cohort), followed by zidovudine plus lamivudine plus efavirenz (22%) and tenofovir plus lamivudine or emtricitabine plus efavirenz (10%). At cohort enrolment, viral suppression was defined as HIV-RNA <400 copies/mL was 95.8%. Future plans: Through collaboration with other institutions, we are planning several substudies, including the evaluation of the risk for cardiovascular diseases, the assessment of bone mineral density, screening for liver cirrhosis using fibroscan technology and investigation of drug-drug interactions between ART and common drugs used for non-communicable diseases.;https://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015490;3.7;3.6;3.5;;e015490;;

As a result, our understanding of drug resistance, and its impact on subsequent therapeutic regimens available in these settings, remains limited. We investigate the prevalence and correlates of HIV-1 drug resistance among 94 participants of the Ethiopia Pediatric HIV Cohort failing first-line combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) using dried blood spot-based genotyping. Overall, 81% (73/90) of successfully genotyped participants harbored resistance mutations, including 69% (62/90) who harbored resistance to both Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) and Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs). Strikingly, 42% of resistant participants harbored resistance to all four NRTIs recommended for second-line use in this setting, meaning that there are effectively no remaining cART options for these children. Longer cART duration and prior regimen changes were significantly associated with detection of drug resistance mutations. Replicate genotyping increased the breadth of drug resistance detected in 34% of cases, and thus is recommended for consideration when typing from blood spots. Implementation of timely drug resistance testing and access to newer antiretrovirals and drug classes are urgently needed to guide clinical decision-making and improve outcomes for HIV-infected children on first-line cART in Ethiopia.;http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/10/2/60;5.8;5.3;4.3;;60;;

The Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC)-null genotype is predominant in sub-Saharan African ancestry populations and is the major genetic determinant of benign ethnic neutropenia which has been associated with increased risk of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 acquisition and mother-to-child transmission. However, the impact of DARC-null-linked neutropenia on HIV disease progression remains controversial. While the DARC-null genotype is associated with low numbers of circulating neutrophils, the effects of the polymorphism on neutrophil functions is unknown. We investigated the impact of the DARC-null trait and lower absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) on key neutrophil effector functions [proteolytic activity within the phagosome following Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation] in 20 HIV negative and 22 HIV-1 chronically infected black South Africans. Phagosome maturation was measured by flow cytometry following Fc-mediated uptake of IgG opsonized beads; ROS production was measured by chemi-luminescence after activation of neutrophils with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Activated neutrophils were also visualized by fluorescent microscopy for NET quantification. Study subjects were genotyped for the DARC trait using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays and ANCs were measured by full blood count. As expected, the DARC-null polymorphism was highly prevalent in our participant cohort (69%) and was strongly associated with lower ANCs in uninfected (p = 0.0007) and HIV-1 infected (p = 0.03) subjects. We observed enhanced proteolytic activity within the phagosome in the absence of DARC at 10 min (p = 0.05 and p = 0.009) and 60 min (p = 0.05 and p = 0.07) in uninfected and HIV-1 infected subjects, respectively. ROS was unaffected by DARC trait irrespective of HIV status. Furthermore, formation of NETs was reduced in neutrophils from DARC-null subjects (p = 0.04) following prolonged in vitro stimulation, but only in HIV-1 infected subjects. The data indicate differential neutrophil function in the absence of DARC that may be moderately modulated by HIV-1 infection but overall, the data suggest that DARC-null trait is not deleterious to neutrophil effector functions in African populations.";https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00551/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;551;;

All Rights Reserved.The aim of early combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) of HIV is to limit the seeding of the viral reservoir during the initial phase of infection and, consequently, decrease intrahost viral diversity. Here, we assessed the effect of early cART on size and complexity of the proviral reservoir. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and plasma samples were obtained from ten HIV-infected Brazilian individuals diagnosed at the acute phase of infection, before (PREART) and 12 months (M12ART) after suppressive cART. HIV proviral reservoir size was determined by quantitative real-time PCR; intrahost viral diversity of the env C2-V3 region was assessed by single genome amplification or next-generation sequencing in PBMC and plasma, respectively. Mean nucleotide diversity () and normalized Shannon entropy (HSN) were used to infer the complexity of the viral population. Compared to PREART, M12ART saw an immunological recovery with a gain of 200 CD4+ T cells (P = 0.008) and a normalization of the CD4/CD8 ratio [1.0 (IQR: 0.88-C1.18), P = 0.016], as well as a significant decrease in HIV-1 RNA (4 log, P = 0.004) and DNA (1 log, P = 0.002) levels. The median time to achieve viral suppression was 3 months (IQR: 2.8-5.8 months). The high intermixing between sequences from both visits suggests that the HIV-1 DNA reservoir remained remarkably stable under cART. After 1 year of cART, there was a minor reduction in proviral  (PreART = 0.20 vs. M12ART = 0.10; P = 0.156) but a significant decrease in HSN (PreART = 0.41 vs. M12ART = 0.25; P = 0.019). We found no correlation between  or HSN at PreART and the rate of HIV DNA decay, T CD4+ counts, or CD4/CD8 ratio at M12ART. Based on a small cohort of Brazilian infected individuals under early cART and analyses of the env region, 1 year of follow-up suggested a reservoir size reduction, allowed a significant decrease of HIV-1 complexity, and achieved immunological restoration regardless of the initial HIV-1 plasma viral load, CD4+ T cell counts, or HIV-1 subtype. However, further studies in the Brazilian setting aiming a longer follow-up and larger cohort are required in this field.";https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00145/full;5.0;5.6;6.4;;145;;

Methods A prospective ongoing fat change assessment including clinical evaluation and dual X-ray absorptiometry scan is being conducted in all consecutive patients initiating ART from January 2008. Arm, leg, trunk, and total fat as well as fat mass ratio were determined. Results A total of 146 patients were included (80% male, 40% MSM). Mean age was 44 years, HIV-1 RNA was 4.98 log 10 copies/mL, and CD4 count was 254 cells/L. The most common initial antiretroviral combination included non-nucleoside reverse transcription inhibitor (NNRTI) drugs followed by protease inhibitor (PI) and integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based regimens. At month 36, an increase was seen in the body mass index (BMI), total fat, trunk fat, and limb fat. The fat mass ratio (FMR) also showed a significant increase in both men and women (P = 0.001). In patients receiving NNRTI-or INSTI-based regimens (but not PIs), there was a marginal but statistically significant increase in the FMR (0.10 and 0.07, respectively; P = 0.01). Sixty-Two subjects completed 60 months of follow-up. FMR showed a significant increase even in the PI group at this time point (P < 0.03). Conclusions We observed a significant increase in the fat and lean body mass in all compartments and treatment groups over 36 and 60 months. Clinically irrelevant differences were found in fat distribution regardless of the treatment group and baseline characteristics. The data suggest that current antiretroviral regimens have little impact on BFD during the first years of treatment.";https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/104/3/900/5144616;11.4;10.9;9.8;0021972X;;;

We investigated these changes in the first 96 weeks of treatment with low-dose stavudine or tenofovir regimens. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a double blind, randomised controlled trial performed in South-Africa, Uganda and India comparing low-dose stavudine (20 mg twice daily) with tenofovir in combination with efavirenz and lamivudine in antiretroviral-naïve adults (n = 1067) (Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02670772). Over 96 weeks, data were collected on fasting lipids, glucose and insulin. Insulin resistance was assessed with the HOMA-IR index and 10-year CVD risk with the Framingham risk score (FRS). A generalized linear mixed model was used to estimate trends over time. Results: Participants were on average 35.3 years old, 57.6% female and 91.8% Black African. All lipid levels increased following treatment initiation, with the sharpest increase in the first 24 weeks of treatment. The increase in all lipid subcomponents over 96 weeks was higher among those in the stavudine than the tenofovir group. Insulin resistance increased steadily with no difference detected between study groups. FRS rose from 1.90% (1.84-1.98%) at baseline to 2.06 (1.98-2.15%) at week 96 for the total group, with no difference between treatment arms (p = 0.144). Lipid changes were more marked in Indian than African participants. Conclusion: Lipid levels increased in both groups, with low-dose stavudine resulting in a worse lipid profile compared to tenofovir. Insulin resistance increased, with no difference between regimens. CVD risk increased over time and tended to increase more in the group on stavudine. The low CVD risk across both arms argues against routine lipid and glucose monitoring in the absence of other CVD risk factors. In high risk patients, monitoring may only be appropriate at least a year after treatment initiation.;https://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12977-018-0460-z;7.3;6.7;6.7;;77;;

Objective: In this study, the abundance of HIV-1 infection in Iranian children, and also detection of the TDR in naïve HIV-1 infected pediatric (under 12 years old) were evaluated. Materials: From June 2014 to January 2019, a total of 544 consecutive treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected individuals enrolled in this study. After RNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing of the HIV-1 pol gene, the DRM and phylogenetic analysis were successfully performed on the plasma specimens of the ART-naïve HIV-1-infected-children under 12 years old. The DRMs were recognized using the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database. Results: Out of the 544 evaluated treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected individuals, 15 (2.8%) cases were children under 12 years old. The phylogenetic analyses of the amplified region of pol gene indicated that all of the 15 HIV-1-infected pediatric patients were infected by CRF35_AD, and a total of 13.3% (2/15) of these children were infected with HIV-1 variants with SDRMs (one child harbored two related SDRMs [D67N, V179F], and another child had three related SDRMs [M184V, T215F, and K103N]), according to the last algorithm of the WHO. No PIs-related SDRMs were observed in HIV-1-infected children. Conclusion: The current study demonstrated that a total of 13.3% of treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected Iranian pediatrics (under 12 years old) were infected with HIV-1 variants with SDRMs. Therefore, it seems that screening to recognize resistance-associated mutations before the initiation of ARTs among Iranian children is essential for favorable medication efficacy and dependable prognosis.;http://www.eurekaselect.com/176449/article;2.7;2.4;2.3;1570162X;;;

After excluding contributing comorbidities, several factors may impair neurocognition including severe immune suppression, incomplete antiviral efficacy, drugs' persistent immune activation, vascular abnormalities, and drugs' neurotoxicity. The effectiveness of targeted antiretroviral strategies on these risk factors is unknown. Recent Findings: Recent studies support the idea that residual cerebrospinal fluid HIV RNA in the setting of plasma viral suppression is associated with compartmental immune activation but the link to neuronal damage is debated. Some authors have reported an incomplete antiviral efficacy in macrophage-derived cells but targeted antiretroviral regimen switches have not been performed. Additionally, improvements in neurocognition using drugs with better central nervous system penetration or maraviroc (associated with favorable immunological properties) have been observed in pilot studies. Trials evaluating specific interventions for cardiovascular health (including brain white matter abnormalities) and neurotoxicity of antiretrovirals are warranted. Summary: Central nervous system-targeted antiretroviral strategies are needed in patients with uncontrolled cerebrospinal HIV replication, and they may be suggested in subjects with low CD4 nadir, individuals carrying drug-resistant viruses, and those with compartmental immune activation.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11904-018-0375-2;10.3;0;6.5;15483568;;;

Aims of treatment have progressed significantly over the last decade, moving far beyond limitation of short-term morbidity and mortality to optimizing health status for adult life and minimizing the impact of chronic HIV infection on immune system development and health in general. Additionally, there is a greater need for increased awareness and minimization of long-term drug toxicity. The main updates to the previous guidelines include: an increase in the number of indications for antiretroviral therapy (ART) at all ages (higher CD4 thresholds for consideration of ART initiation and additional clinical indications), revised guidance on first- and second-line ART recommendations, including more recently available drug classes, expanded guidance on management of coinfections (including tuberculosis, hepatitis B and hepatitis C) and additional emphasis on the needs of adolescents as they approach transition to adult services. There is a new section on the current ART ‘pipeline’ of drug development, a comprehensive summary table of currently recommended ART with dosing recommendations.

A total of 266 HIV-1 seropositive and 158 HIV-1 seronegative subjects were enrolled. Genotyping of rs12979860 of the IL28B was performed using a predesigned TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. No significant association was found between IL28B rs12979860 polymorphism and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and AIDS development (p >.05). However, in HIV-1 treated patients carrying CC genotype had a more pronounced high levels of CD4+ T-cell compared to subjects with TT genotype (p =.0004).

Xavier et al.Objectives. Pharmacokinetics studies recommend increasing efavirenz dosage in tuberculosis/HIV patients using rifampicin. We aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of 600 versus 800 mg of efavirenz in tuberculosis/HIV patients using rifampicin. Design. We conducted an open label, multicentre, randomized trial from 2006 to 2012. The primary outcome was the proportion of undetectable viral load (HIV-VL) within six months. Secondary outcomes were time to achieve primary endpoint, trajectories of HIV-VL, proportion of any adverse events (AE), proportion of severe and serious AE (SSAE), and time to treatment interruption due to SSAE. Methods. Efavirenz-naïve patients were randomized 30 days after rifampicin-containing regimens initiation to receive 600 (comparison arm) or 800 mg (intervention arm) efavirenz-based regimens and followed-up for 180 days. Results. Sixty-five and 67 participants were respectively included in the comparison and intervention arms with 64.6% (52.5%-65.1%) and 62.7% (50.7%-73.3%) attaining undetectable HIV-VL in six months. Median time to attain undetectable HIV-VL was 70 days in both arms, with HIV-VL overlapping trajectories during follow-up. Cough, acne, and dizziness were more frequent in the intervention arm. SSAE were observed in 19.1% (13.8%-25.8%) and 25.0% (18.9%-33.2%), respectively. Survival curves up to the first SSAE-attributed treatment interruption were similar. None of the differences were statistically significant. Conclusion. Efficacy of efavirenz was similar regardless of dosage. Differences regarding safety occurred as mild and transient events, which did not interfere with treatment. Similar efficacy and safety (SSAE) and lower tolerance (minor AE) in the intervention group favour the use of 600 mg efavirenz in patients using rifampicin.;https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2018/9231835/;5.1;4.3;3.6;23146133;9231835;;

In Benin (West Africa), there are currently no data on HIV drug resistance at failure in paediatric populations. Objectives: To assess the frequency and patterns of HIV drug resistance among children with virological ART failures. Methods: Dried blood spots from 62 HIV-infected children with virological failure were collected at the paediatric clinic of the National Hospital Center in Cotonou for genotyping and plasma drug concentration determination. Results: Characteristics of the population show a median age of 10 years (IQR 6–13) and a median duration on ART of 5 years (IQR 3–7). Viruses from 53 children were successfully amplified. Of these, 76% of patients were on an NNRTI-based regimen and 24% on a boosted PI-based regimen. NRTI, NNRTI and dual-class resistance was present in 71%, 84% and 65% of cases, respectively. Only 4% of the children had major resistance mutations to PIs and none had major resistance mutations to integrase inhibitors. Among the participants, 25% had undetectable antiretroviral concentrations. Conclusions: Our results showed that the development of drug resistance could be one of the main consequences of high and continuous viral replication in HIV-infected children in Benin. Thus, inadequate attention to monitoring lifelong ART in children may prevent achievement of the goal of the United Nations Program on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) of 90% viral suppression among patients receiving ART.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/73/11/3143/5060707;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

However, without proper infrastructure, it has resulted in emergence of drug resistance mutations in infected populations. To determine drug resistance mutations among patients attending a comprehensive care facility in Nairobi, 65 blood samples were successfully sequenced. Methods: Whole blood samples were also tested for CD4+T-cell count and plasma HIV-1 RNA Viral load. Drug-resistance testing targeting the HIV-1 RT gene was determined. Patients were on first line ART that consisted of two NRTIs, and one NNRTI. Results: Females were younger (mean 42) than males (mean 45) and lower median CD4+ counts (139 cells/µl) than males (152 cells/µl). The prevalence of drug resistance mutations (any major mutation) in this population was 23.1% (15/65). Major NRTI mutations were detected in 11 patient samples, which included M184V (n = 6), M41L (n=3), D67N (n=2), K219Q (n=3) and T215F (n=2). Major NNRTI mutations were detected in 14 patient samples. They included K103N (n = 10), G190A (n = 1), Y181C (n = 1) and Y188L (n = 1). Conclusion: Presence of major mutations in this study calls for proper laboratory infrastructure to monitor treatment as well as regular appraisals of available regimens.;http://www.panafrican-med-journal.com/content/article/29/186/full/;0.5;0.6;0.7;;186;;

The identification of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) mutations leading to drug resistance enables patient-specific adaptation of the treatment regimen and predicts the risk of transmission of drug-resistant HIV. In this study, we report for the first time the prevalence in Kuwait of non-polymorphic resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) in patients under first-line antiretroviral therapy. Viral RNA was extracted from plasma samples of 64 treatment-naïve (untreated) and 64 treatment-experienced patients. The HIV-1 load was determined by real-time RT-PCR. The protease- and reverse transcriptase-encoding regions were analyzed by subtyping, and for drug resistance. The HIV-1 load at sampling in treatment-naïve patients ranged from 1.61 x 104 to 1.91 x 10 6 copies/ml, whereas that in treatment-experienced patients ranged from < 20 to 8.25 x 10 4 copies/ml (p < 0.001). Ten different HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant forms were found with the predominance of CRF01_AE, B and C. Non-polymorphic mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs were detected in 8 treatment-naïve patients (12.5%) and 11 treatment-experienced patients (28.9%; p = 0.46). RAMs detected in treatment-naïve patients are known to be associated with resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Among treatment-experienced patients, five patients (13.1%) had mutations associated with high-level resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 4 patients (10.5%) had mutations associated with resistance to NNRTIs, one patient (2.6%) had resistance to both NRTIs and NNRTIs, and one patient (2.6%) had resistance to both protease inhibitors (PIs) and NNRTIs. These results necessitate efforts to be made for reducing emergence of resistance-associated mutations in treated patients, and highlight the need for continuous monitoring of drug resistance patterns in Kuwait.";http://www.elis.sk/index.php?page=shop.product_details&flypage=flypage.tpl&product_id=5798&category_id=145&option=com_virtuemart;1.2;1.1;1.0;0001723X;;;

However, NNRTI-based regimens are more prone to resistance development than protease inhibitors (PIs) in a context in which drug interruptions are frequent. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of NNRTIs with PIs in HIV-1- infected patients in Guinea-Bissau. Methods: This open-label randomized, 2-arm superiority trial compared the use of 2 NRTIs plus either one NNRTI (efavirenz or nevirapine) or one PI (lopinavir/ritonavir) in treatment-naive HIV-1- infected adults in the Bissau HIV Cohort (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT0019235). The primary endpoint was HIV-1 RNA ,400 copies per milliliter after 12 months of treatment. Results: Between May 5, 2011, and April 26, 2013, 400 patients were included in the study. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the proportions of patients with viral suppression were similar in the NNRTI [65/197 (33.0%)] and PI [68/203 (33.5%)] arms (P = 0.92). No PI resistance was detected, but high-level NNRTI resistance was seen in 17/30 (56.7%) of NNRTI vs. 3/26 (11.5%) of PI-treated patients, P , 0.01. After 1 year of follow-up, 65 patients died (16.3%) and 93 were lost to follow-up (23.3%). There was no difference in mortality (hazard ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval: 0.51 to 1.36) or frequency of clinical adverse events between treatment arms [NNRTI: 73/197 (37.1%); and PI: 69/203 (34.0%); P = 0.52]. Conclusions: In patients at an HIV clinic in Guinea-Bissau, treatment with PIs led to less development of resistance compared with NNRTIs but was not superior in terms of viral suppression, CD4 cell increment, mortality, or severe adverse events.";http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201811010-00015;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

DRMs against nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have never been analyzed and reported in HIV-1 patients in Padang (West Sumatra, Indonesia). Objective - This study aimed to identify NRTI- and NNRTI-DRMs from HIV-1 proviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in HIV-infected patients who had received ARV therapy for > 12 months at the Dr. M. Djamil General Hospital in Padang. Material and Methods - We isolated HIV-1 proviral DNA from blood samples from 105 HIV-1 patients who had undergone first-line ARV therapy for > 12 months. Isolates were amplified via a nested PCR technique using two primer-specific types of reverse transcriptase (RT). The amplicon was electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gel and then sequenced. Analysis of DRMs in the HIV-1 RT genes was based on the Standford HIV database. Results - The 17 isolates from 105 ARV-treated patients, eight RT genes were successfully sequenced, and DRM of RT inhibitors was found in one of the isolates (12.5%). The Stanford HIV database analysis detected three new DRMs at the 184th, 215th and 190th codon positions, causing three mutations: M184L and T215N (NRTI-DRMs) with low-level resistance to zidovudine, and G190D (NNRTI-DRM). Conclusion - We concluded that the new DRMs found in Padang, West Sumatra indicates the importance of genotypic resistance testing and the periodic evaluation of the effectiveness of ARV drugs currently in use.;http://www.romj.org/2018-0207;0.3;0.5;0.6;;e0207;;

Methodology: This study enrolled HIV-infected Thais who were treated with third-line regimens consisting of darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r), etravirine (ETR), tipranavir/ritonavir or raltegravir. Results: Fifty-four adolescents 2-17 years of age were enrolled from 8 sites and followed for 48 weeks. Reasons for switch were second-line failure (n = 44) and toxicity to second-line regimens (n = 10). At switching to third-line ARV, the median age (interquartile range) was 14.3 (12.4-15.4) years. Genotypes at time of second-line failure (n = 44) were M184V (77%), 4 thymidine analogue mutations (25%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant associated mutation (RAM) (80%), ETR-RAM score 4 (14%), any lopinavir-RAM (59%) and 1 major DRV-RAM (41%). The third-line regimens had a median of 4 (min-max, 4-6) drugs and included ETR/DRV/r (43%), DRV/r (33%), ETR (17%), tipranavir/ritonavir (2%) or raltegravir/DRV/r/ (4%). The median CD4 (interquartile range) increased from 16% (12-21) at third-line switch to 21% (18-25) and 410 (172-682) to 607 (428-742) cells/mm3 at 48 weeks (P < 0.001). HIV RNA declined from 3.9 (2.9-4.9) to 1.6 (1.6-3.0) log10 copies/mL (P < 0.001) and 33/50 (66%) had levels <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks. Seventeen (31%) had HIV-RNA 1000 copies/mL; about half due to poor adherence; genotyping in 13 of these adolescents revealed ETR-RAM score 4 in 2 (15%) and 1 major DRV-RAM in 7 (54%).

Methods and results: We selected 48 patients from the DREAM cohort (Maputo, Mozambique); their median pre-ART CD4+ cell count was 165 cells/l. At t1 patients were receiving ART since a median of 12.2 months (mainly zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine), their median HIV RNA was 3.8 log10 copies/mL, 43 (89.6%) presented at least one resistance-associated mutation (RAM), most frequently for lamivudine/emtricitabine, nevirapine and efavirenz. Resistance to tenofovir, was 10% at 1 year and higher than 20% at 2 years, while projection at 3 years was >30%. At t2, 42 (89.4%) had a predicted low-level or higher resistance to at least 1 s-line drug. At t1, the frequency of RAM in patients with a lower adherence to pharmacy appointments (<95%) was significantly lower (12/20, 60% for NRTI and 14/20, 70% for NNRTI) than in those with a better adherence (26/28, 92.8% for NRTI and 25/28, 89.3% for NNRTI) (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.63, p = 0.012 and OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.06-1.29, p = 0.103, respectively). Overall thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs) accumulation rate was 0.32/year, 0.50/year in the subgroup with HIV RNA >10,000 copies/mL; NNRTI RAM accumulation rate was 0.15/year, 0.40/year in the subgroup with HIV RNA >10,000 copies/mL. Conclusions: While the activity of NNRTIs is compromised early during failure, tenofovir and zidovudine activity are reduced more frequently after 1 year of documented virological failure of thymidine analogue-based first-line ART, with RAMs accumulating faster in patients with higher viral loads.

It has shown high virological efficacy in both treatment-naïve and -experienced patients. We carried out a retrospective case chart analysis of HIV-1-positive adults commenced on DTG between July 2014 and September 2015. Patients were identified from records as either treatment-naïve or antiretroviral therapy (ART) experienced. Outcomes included: (1) virological response (HIV-1 RNA viral load at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks), (2) immunological response (CD4+ cell count at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks) and (3) tolerability (side effects and discontinuation). The main exclusion criteria were patients transferring care already established on DTG from other treatment centres or inadequate follow-up information (defined as attendance at <50% of clinical and serological follow-up visits). One hundred and fifty-seven commenced DTG out of 823 patients on ART; 106 (68%) were switched to DTG from another regimen, and 51 (32%) were ART-naïve. One naïve and 14 treatment-experienced patients were excluded from the analysis due to failure to attend clinical follow-up. Analysis of HIV-1 RNA viral load (HIV-1 VL) was divided into three groups: 50 new starters, 68 suppressed at switch and 24 not suppressed at switch. New starters: Baseline median HIV-1 RNA VL 71,259 copies/mL (19,536Q25196,413Q75); 73% were virally undetectable (HIV-1 RNA VL <70 copies/mL) by week 4. Switching patients: Of those with an HIV-1 RNA undetectable viral load prior to switching, two were detectable with a mean viral load of 443,730 copies/mL after four weeks. Of the 24 patients detectable at switch (median HIV-1 VL 2212 [311Q2543,467Q75]), 10 were detectable after four weeks. For those with a recordable viraemia, the median HIV-1 VL reduced to 376 (220Q251181Q75). At week 12, four patients were detectable with a median VL of 12,390 (567Q2552,285Q75). Overall, 56 (35%) reported side effects; 40 (25%) reported either difficulty with low mood, anxiety or sleep disturbance. Sixteen (10%) discontinued DTG, with 13 (8%) due to intolerable side effects. DTG is a useful drug in naïve or switch patients. It has the potential to effectively suppress the viral load within the first four weeks of treatment and thus reduces infectiousness. Within the cohort, DTG was generally well tolerated but side effects such as low mood, anxiety and sleep disturbance were high, with 8% of patients discontinuing treatment.";http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956462416688127;2.5;2.5;2.7;09564624;;;

Our analysis describes the duration of sequential ART regimens and identifies the determinants leading to treatment change in HIV-positive patients initiating in Asia. Methods: All HIV-positive adult patients initiating first-line ART in 2003–2013, from eight clinical sites among seven countries in Asia. Patient follow-up was to May 2014. Kaplan–Meier curves were used to estimate the time to second-line ART and third-line ART regimen. Factors associated with treatment durability were assessed using Cox proportional hazards model. Results: A total of 16,962 patients initiated first-line ART. Of these, 4,336 patients initiated second-line ART over 38,798 person-years (pys), a crude rate of 11.2 (95% CI 10.8, 11.5) per 100 pys. The probability of being on first-line ART increased from 83.7% (95% CI 82.1, 85.1%) in 2003–2005 to 87.9% (95% CI 87.1, 88.6%) in 2010–2013. Third-line ART was initiated by 1,135 patients over 8,078 pys, a crude rate of 14.0 (95% CI 13.3, 14.9) per 100 pys. The probability of continuing second-line ART significantly increased from 64.9% (95% CI 58.5, 70.6%) in 2003–2005 to 86.2% (95% CI 84.7, 87.6%) in 2010–2013. Conclusions: Rates of discontinuation of first- and second-line regimens have decreased over the last decade in Asia. Subsequent regimens were of shorter duration compared to the first-line regimen initiated in the same year period. Lower CD4+ T-cell count and the use of suboptimal regimens were important factors associated with higher risk of treatment switch.;https://www.intmedpress.com/journals/avt/abstract.cfm?id=3194&pid=48;4.4;4.1;3.9;13596535;;;

By the end of 2013 UNAIDS estimated that there were 35 million (range 33.2–37.2 million) adults and children living with HIV/AIDS worldwide. Despite the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the need for new anti-HIV agents is extremely high because the existing medicines do not provide the complete curation and exhibit serious side effects, and their application leads to the appearance of resistant strains. This chapter explores the medicinal chemistry efforts that gave rise to currently launched drugs as well as investigational anti-HIV agents. Currently used and studied molecular targets of antiretrovirals and the main classes of HIV-1 inhibitors are presented. Among the future prospects, we discuss the efforts directed to overcome the latent HIV infection, utilization of natural products as potential anti-HIV agents, recent trends on development of biologics as potential anti-HIV medicines, and application of computer-aided methods in the discovery of new anti-HIV drugs.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/7355_2015_5001;1.4;1.6;1.6;18622461;;;

Many standard resistance genotypes exclude testing for resistance to integrase inhibitors (""IR testing""), although this class of drugs is a component of most recommended first-line regimens. Methods: We compared the 96-week clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of 2 strategies: no IR testing vs IR testing performed at human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosis. The base case prevalence of transmitted integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-resistant (INSTI-R) virus is estimated at 0.1%. With no IR testing, all patients start dolutegravir (DTG)-based ART after genotype; 12-week suppression rates are 90% (INSTI-susceptible [INSTI-S] virus) and 35% (INSTI-R virus). Those not suppressed at 12 weeks undergo IR testing; if diagnosed with INSTI-R virus, they change to ritonavir-boosted darunavir (DRV/r)-based ART. With IR testing, all patients are diagnosed with INSTI-S/INSTI-R virus prior to ART initiation and start DTG- or DRV/r-based regimens, respectively. Costs include IR tests (175 US dollars [USD]) and ART (41 100-44 900 USD/year). We examined the impact of key parameters in sensitivity analyses. Results: IR testing resulted in worse clinical outcomes compared to no IR testing and increased costs by 200 USD/person/year. Prevalence of transmitted INSTI-R virus did not affect the favored strategy. No IR testing remained clinically preferred unless DTG suppression of INSTI-R virus was <20% or 96-week DRV/r suppression was >92%. If quality of life was worse with DRV/r-than DTG-based ART, no IR testing was clinically preferred over an even broader range of parameters. Conclusions. In patients with newly diagnosed HIV, IR testing is projected to result in worse outcomes and is not cost-effective. Pretreatment assessment for INSTI resistance should not be recommended in treatment guidelines.";https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/8/1274/3865792;14.0;13.8;12.5;10584838;;;

Objectives: 4 0 -Ethnyl-2 0 -fluoro-2 0 -deoxyadenosine (EFdA) is a novel translocation-defective reverse transcriptase inhibitor. We investigated the virological and biochemical inhibitory potentials of EFdA against a broad spectrum of subtype-specific chimeric viruses and compared it with tenofovir alafenamide, nevirapine, efavirenz, rilpivirine and etravirine. Methods: pNL4.3 chimeric viruses encoding gag-pol from treatment-naive patients (n "" 24) and therapy-failure patients (n "" 3) and a panel of reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant strains (n "" 7) were used to compare the potency of reverse transcriptase inhibitor drugs. The phenotypic drug susceptibility assay was performed using TZM-bl cells. In vitro inhibition assays were done using patient-derived reverse transcriptase. IC 50 values of NNRTIs were calculated using a PicoGreen-based spectrophotometric assay. Steady-state kinetics were used to determine the apparent binding affinity (K m.dNTP ) of triphosphate form of EFdA (EFdA-TP) and dATP. Results: Among the chimeric treatment-naive viruses, EFdA had an ex vivo antiretroviral activity [median (IQR) EC 50 "" 1.4 nM (0.6–2.1 nM)] comparable to that of tenofovir alafenamide [1.6 nM (0.5–3.6 nM)]. Subtype-specific differences were found for etravirine (P "" 0.004) and rilpivirine (P "" 0.017), where HIV-1C had the highest EC 50 values. EFdA had a greater comparative efficiency [calculated by dividing the efficiency of monophosphate form of EFdA (EFdA-MP) incorporation (k cat.EFdA-TP /K m.EFdA-TP ) over the efficiency of dATP incorporation (k cat.dATP / K m.dATP )] compared with the natural substrate dATP, with a fold change of between 1.6 and 3.2. Ex vivo analysis on reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant strains showed EFdA to have a higher potency. Despite the presence of rilpivirine DRMs, some non-B strains showed hypersusceptibility to rilpivirine. Conclusions: Our combined virological and biochemical data suggest that EFdA inhibits both WT and reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant viruses efficiently in a subtype-independent manner. In contrast, HIV-1C is least susceptible to etravirine and rilpivirine.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/73/10/2721/5057985;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

We characterized, for the first time, the prevalence of HIV-1 subtypes and drug resistance mutations in a western region of Iran. Methods: This study was conducted among 122 patients on ART at a major referral center in Kermanshah, Iran. Nested PCR was performed using RT gene-specific primers from the pol gene. Sequencing was followed by amplification and purification of the desired sequence. Subtypes and mutations were determined using the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database. Results: Most patients (92.6%) had subtype CRF 35-AD; 7.4% had subtype B. In total, 36.1% of the patients had at least 1 mutation associated with resistance RT inhibitors. The greatest rates of high-level resistance were observed for nevirapine (21.3%) and efavirenz (19.7%). Conclusions: Our results showed a high prevalence of drug resistance mutations in strains isolated from patients on treatment. At our center, we therefore recommend that genotyping be performed.

Different rule-based algorithms were developed to infer HIV-1 susceptibility to antiretrovirals from genotypic data. However, there is discordance between them, resulting in difficulties for clinical decisions about which treatment to use. Here, we developed ensemble classifiers integrating three interpretation algorithms: Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le SIDA (ANRS), Rega, and the genotypic resistance interpretation system from Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (HIVdb). Three approaches were applied to develop a classifier with a single resistance profile: stacked generalization, a simple plurality vote scheme and the selection of the interpretation system with the best performance. The strategies were compared with the Friedman’s test and the performance of the classifiers was evaluated using the F-measure, sensitivity and specificity values. We found that the three strategies had similar performances for the selected antiretrovirals. For some cases, the stacking technique with naïve Bayes as the learning algorithm showed a statistically superior F-measure. This study demonstrates that ensemble classifiers can be an alternative tool for clinical decision-making since they provide a single resistance profile from the most commonly used resistance interpretation systems.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10916-017-0802-8;5.0;5.2;5.8;01485598;155;;

We sought to empirically evaluate these guidelines using data from an observational cohort. Setting: The Uganda AIDS Rural Treatment Outcomes study observed adults with HIV in southwestern Uganda from the time of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and monitored adherence with electronic pill bottles. Methods: We included participants on ART with a detectable HIV RNA viral load and who remained on the same regimen until the subsequent measurement. We fit logistic regression models with viral resuppression as the outcome of interest and both initial viral load level and average adherence as predictors of interest. Results: We analyzed 139 events. Median ART duration was 0.92 years, and 100% were on a nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor-based regimen. Viral resuppression occurred in 88% of those with initial HIV RNA <1000 copies/mL and 42% if HIV RNA was >1000 copies/mL (P <0.001). Adherence after detectable viremia predicted viral resuppression for those with HIV RNA <1000 copies/mL (P = 0.011) but was not associated with resuppression for those with HIV RNA >1000 copies/mL (P = 0.894; interaction term P = 0.077). Conclusions: Among patients on ART with detectable HIV RNA >1000 copies/mL who remain on the same regimen, only 42% resuppressed at next measurement, and there was no association between interval adherence and viral resuppression.

The effect of these parameters on the outcome of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected patients is poorly understood. Objectives The present study used the pyrosequencing Roche 454 prototype assay to determine whether antiretroviral efficacy is correlated with viral diversity and minority drug resistance mutations in HIV-infected treatment-naive patients and to compare assay performance in B and non-B subtypes. Study design The study included 30 HIV-1 infected naive patients (20 with subtype non-B and 10 with subtype B). Ultradeep pyrosequencing of protease and reverse transcriptase genes was performed at baseline and 1 month after HAART initiation. Plasma HIV VL was measured at 0 and after 1, 3, and 6 months of HAART. Results Pre-HAART minority drug resistance mutations were observed to NRTI in 4 patients, to NNRTI in 6 patients, and to PI in 1 patient; there was no difference in HAART-induced VL decay between patients. Pre-HAART diversity was significantly correlated with the time elapsed since HIV-1 infection diagnosis, but not with the subtype, VL, or CD4 count. Patients with an undetectable VL after 3 months of HAART had a higher pre-HAART diversity. Pre- and post-HAART diversities were not statistically different. There was no difference in assay performance between subtype B and non-B. Conclusions A high pre-HAART viral diversity might have a positive effect on the outcome of HAART.

Most patients present a symptomatic disease that can be potentially serious, but neurological involvement during primary HIV-1 infection has been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of primary HIV-1 infection patients presenting neurological symptoms and to compare them with primary HIV-1 infection patients without neurological involvement. Retrospective case-control study (1:3) comparing primary HIV-1 infection patients with and without neurological involvement enrolled in the Acute/Recent Hospital Clinic PHI Cohort between 1997 and 2016. Matching criteria included age (±10 years), gender, year of diagnosis (±4 years), and Fiebig stage. The conditional logit model was used for comparisons. Fourteen out of 463 patients (3.02%) enrolled in the Acute/Recent Hospital Clinic PHI Cohort between 1997 and 2016 presented neurological symptoms. 28.5% of cases presented as meningitis and 71.5% as meningoencephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid showed non-specific findings, including pleocytosis with lymphocyte predominance and increased protein levels. All cases required hospitalisation, whereas only 19% of the controls did. No other pathogen was identified in any case, but five patients initiated empirically antimicrobial treatment for other aetiologies until diagnosis was confirmed. CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly lower (p = 0.039) and plasmatic viral load significantly higher in the case group, compared to controls (p = 0.028). Risk factors, HIV-1 tropism, subtype distribution, and prescribed ART regimens were comparable between cases and controls. After 6 months on ART, 92% of cases had undetectable viral load, similar to controls, and CD4/CD8 ratio became also comparable between groups. All cases recovered rapidly with ART and were discharged without sequels. Neurological involvement during primary HIV-1 infection is unusual but serious, always requiring hospitalisation. Diagnosis is difficult because of the wide range of symptoms and similarities with other viral aetiologies. Neurological manifestations during primary HIV-1 infection are associated with a lower CD4/CD8 ratio and with a higher viral load than controls. Immediate ART initiation and rapid viral load decrease are required, allowing complete clinical recovery.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13365-017-0548-6;5.0;4.6;4.7;13550284;;;

Data are limited, however, on the association between renal function changes and TDF exposure in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected Taiwanese patients. Methods Medical records of HIV-infected Taiwanese patients seeking HIV care at a university hospital from 2011 to 2014 were reviewed. The change of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was compared between patients not receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and those starting cART with or without TDF. The determinants of annual eGFR changes and factors associated with greater annual eGFR decline in TDF-exposed patients were explored. Results A total of 775 patients were included: 140 were cART-naïve, 393 received TDF-containing cART, and 242 received cART without TDF. Compared with cART-naïve patients, the annual eGFR decline was greater in TDF-exposed patients (0.57 ± 8.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 2.7 ± 8.9 mL/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.012). The annual eGFR decline between patients receiving cART with or without TDF was similar (2.7 ± 8.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 1.8 ± 8.3 mL/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.567). Diabetes was associated with worsening eGFR decline in all studied patients. TDF exposure correlated with an additional annual eGFR decline of 2.73 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% confidence interval 0.139–5.326, p = 0.039) in patients with CD4 count < 350 cells/L. Among TDF-exposed patients, the factors associated with annual eGFR decline of > 3 mL/min/1.73 m2 were higher baseline eGFR and lower CD4 counts. Conclusion Among HIV-infected Taiwanese patients, cART exposure correlated with the decline of renal function. However, TDF-exposed patients are more likely to have prominent eGFR decline, especially those with higher baseline eGFR, advanced HIV disease, and diabetes.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1684118215008427;3.9;4.3;4.8;16841182;;;

However, this information may be unavailable or inaccurate, particularly for patients with multiple treatment lines often attending different clinics. We trained statistical models for predicting drug exposure from current HIV-1 genotype. These models were trained on 63,742 HIV-1 nucleotide sequences derived from patients with known therapeutic history, and on 6,836 genotype-phenotype pairs (GPPs). The mean performance regarding prediction of drug exposure on two test sets was 0.78 and 0.76 (ROC-AUC), respectively. The mean correlation to phenotypic resistance in GPPs was 0.51 (PhenoSense) and 0.46 (Antivirogram). Performance on prediction of therapy-success on two test sets based on genetic susceptibility scores was 0.71 and 0.63 (ROC-AUC), respectively. Compared to geno2pheno[resistance] , our novel models display a similar or superior performance. Our models are freely available on the internet via www. geno2pheno.org. They can be used for inferring which drug compounds have previously been used by an HIV-1-infected patient, for predicting drug resistance, and for selecting an optimal antiretroviral therapy. Our data-driven models can be periodically retrained without expert intervention as clinical HIV-1 databases are updated and therefore reduce our dependency on hard-to-obtain GPPs.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0174992;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0174992;;

It remains unclear which adherence measure best predicts these outcomes. We compared six patient-reported and objective adherence measures in one ART-naïve cohort in South Africa. Methods: We recruited 230 participants from a community ART clinic and prospectively collected demographic data, CD4 count and HIV-RNA at weeks 0, 16 and 48. We quantified adherence using 3-day self-report (SR), clinic-based pill count (CPC), average adherence by pharmacy refill (PR-average), calculation of medication-free days (PR-gaps), efavirenz therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and an electronic adherence monitoring device (EAMD). Associations between adherence measures and virologic and genotypic outcomes were modelled using logistic regression, with the area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses derived to assess performance of adherence measures in predicting outcomes. Results: At week 48 median (IQR) adherence was: SR 100% (100-100), CPC 100% (95-107), PR-average 103% (95-105), PR-gaps 100% (95-100) and EAMD 86% (59-94), and efavirenz concentrations were therapeutic (>1 mg/L) in 92%. EAMD, PR-average, PR-gaps and CPC best predicted virological outcome at week 48 with AUC ROC of 0.73 (95% CI 0.61-0.83), 0.73 (95% CI 0.61-0.85), 0.72 (95% CI 0.59-0.84) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.52-0.76) respectively. EAMD, PR-gaps and PR-average were highly predictive of detection of resistance mutations at week 48, with AUC ROC of 0.92 (95% CI 0.87-0.97), 0.86 (0.67-1.0) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.65-1.0) respectively. SR and TDM were poorly predictive of outcomes at week 48. Conclusion: EAMD and both PR measures predicted resistance and virological failure similarly. Pharmacy refill data is a pragmatic adherence measure in resource-limited settings where electronic monitoring is unavailable.

Data Sources: A search using PubMed was conducted (up to September 2016) using the following keywords: single tablet regimen AND HIV. Additionally, a PubMed search was conducted for each individual STR using the generic names of the agents. Articles were evaluated for content, and additional references were identified from a review of literature citations. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Studies included were predominantly phase III clinical trials with the exception of tenofovir alafenamide because phase I and phase II trials were also relevant for this new antiretroviral agent. Data Synthesis: Six STRs are currently available for the treatment of HIV-1. Each agent has unique pharmacokinetic, safety, and drug-drug interaction profiles that result in distinct advantages and disadvantages. Three of these agents are first-line recommended therapies per national guidelines because of high virological efficacy and tolerability. Conclusions: STRs have significantly advanced HIV management by minimizing pill burden and improving patient compliance. It is important to consider the nuances of each STR in regard to renal and hepatic function, drug interactions, and tolerability, to ensure safe and effective use.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1060028016682531;5.7;5.2;4.3;10600280;;;

We aimed to describe ART persistence in treatment naïve patients starting therapy in the United Kingdom, and to describe differential persistence by treatment regimen. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study at eight UK centres of ART-naïve adults commencing ART between 2012 and 2015. Aggregate data were extracted from local treatment databases. Time to discontinuation was compared for different third agents and NRTI backbones using incidence rates. Results 1949 patients contributed data to the analysis. Rate of third agent change was 28 per 100 person-years of follow up [95% CI 26–31] and NRTI backbone change of 15 per 100 person-years of follow up [95% CI 14–17]). Rilpivirine, as co-formulated rilpivirine/tenofovir/emtricitabine had a significantly lower discontinuation rate than all other third agents and, excluding single tablet regimens, co-formulated tenofovir/emtricitabine had a significantly lower discontinuation rate than co-formulated abacavir/lamivudine. The reasons for discontinuation were not well recorded. Conclusions Treatment discontinuation is not an uncommon event. Rilpivirine had a significantly lower discontinuation rate than other third agents and tenofovir/emtricitabine a lower rate than co-formulated abacavir/lamivudine.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0163445317300312;8.1;7.5;8.0;01634453;;;

It is approved for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Following approval in 2016, new pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data were reported, which led to important clinical applications. Areas covered: This review provides a summary of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of SOF/VEL therapy for treatment of HCV infection. The topics covered include data regarding the drug’s absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and antiviral activity strategies, such as clinical dose selection and treatment duration. Expert opinion: This novel combination therapy containing 400 mg of SOF plus 100 mg of VEL, taken orally, once daily, with or without food, has an excellent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. SOF/VEL achieved very high rates of sustained virological response in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients with chronic HCV genotype 1–6 infection, including those with compensated cirrhosis or HIV-1 co-infection.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17425255.2017.1292253;5.7;5.9;6.4;17425255;;;

However, larger distribution chain supply in developing countries such as Cameroon is often challenged by counterfeit drugs, poor manufacturing, storage and degradation leading to health and patient adverse consequences. Yet, access to supply chain management in strengthening ARVs quality assurance and outcomes remains poorly documented. More than 53,000 patients have been enrolled on free ARVs medications, but little is documented on quality assurance and validity of safety for affected populations along the supply chain management since 2008. Methods: The cross sectional study was conducted in ARVs distribution units and centers in central, littoral and south west regions of Cameroon. ARVs drugs samples included Nevirapine, Efavirenz, and fixed dose combinations of Zidovudine + Lamivudine, Lamivudine + Stavudine and Zidovudine + Lamivudine + Nevirapine. Drugs packaging and labeling was assessed and galenic assays were performed at National Laboratory of quality Control of Medications and Expertise (LANACOME), Yaoundé, Cameroon. Results: The study covered 16 structures located in eight different towns including the central ARVs store, two regional pharmaceutical procurement centers and thirteen HIV approved treatment centers and management units. A total of 35 ARVs products were collected. Only eight ARVs drugs containing Lamivudine and Stavudine presented with white stains on tablets, however these drugs were standard for all other tests performed. The others 28 ARVs products were standards to all assays performed. Conclusion: We concluded that ARVs drugs freely accessible and distributed to PLWHA are of good quality in Cameroon. However, with the increase number of patients under HAART since 2013, adoption of ""Test and Treat"" approach to reach the 90-90-90 goals and with the implementation of new national antiretroviral regimen guidelines and molecules such as boosted protease inhibitors, continuous quality control and assurance surveillance, monitoring and evaluation is recommended. Assessment of quality of formulations that are more susceptible to degradation such as pediatric formulations for averting the rising multidrug resistance trend is also desired.";http://aidsrestherapy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12981-017-0147-x;3.2;3.8;4.4;;19;;

However, long-term outcomes regarding development of drug resistance are lacking until now. Therefore, we analysed the emergence of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) in women initiating Option B+ in Fort Portal, Uganda, at 12 and 18 months postpartum (ppm). Methods and findings 124 HIV-1 positive pregnant women were enrolled within antenatal care services in Fort Portal, Uganda. Blood samples were collected at the first visit prior starting Option B+ and postpartum at week six, month six, 12 and 18. Viral load was determined by real-time RT-PCR. An RT-PCR covering resistance associated positions in the protease and reverse transcriptase HIV-1 genomic region was performed. PCR-positive samples at 12/18 ppm and respective baseline samples were analysed by next generation sequencing regarding HIV-1 drug resistant variants including low-frequency variants. Furthermore, vertical transmission of HIV-1 was analysed. 49/124 (39.5%) women were included into the DRM analysis. Virological failure, defined as >1000 copies HIV-1 RNA/ml, was observed in three and seven women at 12 and 18 ppm, respectively. Sequences were obtained for three and six of these. In total, DRMs were detected in 3/49 (6.1%) women. Two women displayed dual-class resistance against all recommended first-line regimen drugs. Of 49 mother-infant-pairs no infant was HIV-1 positive at 12 or 18 ppm. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the WHO-recommended Option B+ for PMTCT is effective in a cohort of Ugandan HIV-1 positive pregnant women with regard to the low selection rate ofDRMs and vertical transmission.

Patients and methods: Adult patients with chronic infection by subtype B HIV-1were consecutively enrolled from the start of first-line cART (T0). Genotypic analysis of viral tropism was performed on plasma and interpreted using the bioinformatic tool Geno2pheno, with a false positive rate of 10%. A Bayesian network starting from the viro-immunological data at T0 and at the sixth month of treatment (T1) was set up and this model was evaluated using a PA approach. Results: A total of 262 patients (22.1% bearing an X4 virus) were included; 178 subjects (67.9%) achieved viral suppression. A significant positive indirect effect of bearing X4 virus in plasma at T0 on log10 HIV RNA at T1 was detected (P=0.009), the magnitude of this effect was, however, over 10-fold lower than the direct effect of log10 HIV RNA at T0 on log10 HIV RNA at T1 (P=0.000). Moreover, a significant positive indirect effect of bearing an X4 virus on log10 HIV RNA at T0 (P=0.003) was apparent. Conclusions: PA overcame the limitations implicit in common multiple regression analysis and showed the possible role of pre-treatment viral tropism at the recommended threshold on the outcome of plasma viraemia in naive patients after 6 months of therapy.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dkw348;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

Antiretroviral therapy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women and blacks merits particular scrutiny because these groups have been underrepresented in clinical trials. Methods. To document the effects of raltegravir across sex and racial lines, we conducted a pooled subgroup analysis of the efficacy and safety of raltegravir 400 mg BID plus tenofovir-emtricitabine by sex (women vs men) and self-identified race (black vs non-black) using phase 3 studies in treatment-naive patients. Results. Study participants included 42 black women, 102 non-black women, 48 black men, and 477 non-black men. Clade B infections were less common in women (43.8%) than men (84.6%) and in blacks (45.6%) than non-blacks (80.5%). Baseline CD4 counts were 200 cells/L in 52.2% of blacks and 31.6% of non-blacks. Black men had the largest proportion of patients with baseline CD4 counts <50 cells/L and the highest nontreatment-related discontinuation rate among the 4 sex-by-race subgroups. Human immunodeficiency virus-ribonucleic acid levels <50 copies/mL were achieved at week 48 in 92.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80.1-98.5) of black women, 93.6% (95% CI, 86.6-97.6) of non-black women, 82.9% (95% CI, 67.9-92.8) of black men, and 91.4% (95% CI, 88.4-93.8) of non-black men. Serious clinical adverse events were reported in 9.0% of women versus 8.8% of men and in 11.1% of blacks versus 8.5% of non-blacks. Conclusions. In this post hoc analysis of patients with previously untreated HIV-1 infection receiving raltegravir plus tenofoviremtricitabine, generally comparable results were achieved across sex and racial subgroups. However, black men had a lower response rate than either black women or non-black men, partially attributable to lower baseline CD4 counts and higher discontinuation rates.;https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofw047/3058657;3.5;4.6;3.8;;;;

Although tenofovir (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC)/efavirenz (EFV) and zidovudine (ZDV)/lamivudine (3TC)/efavirenz (EFV) are used as preferred first line regimen, their head-to-head comparison in terms of their efficacy and tolerability was limited. This review aimed to synthesize the best available evidence on the comparative efficacy and tolerability of the two regimens. Methods. Seven sites and databases in addition to Google search until August 20, 2016, were searched. Only randomized clinical trials conducted on adult population were included in this study. Our primary outcome was viral load suppression while secondary outcomes were death and tolerability. Undetectable viral load is defined as <50 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) copies/ml. Joanna Briggs institute meta-analysis of statistics assessment and review instrument (JBI-MAStARI) and critical appraisal and data extraction tool were applied for critical assessment and data extraction, respectively. We performed a random effect meta-analysis to pool the relative risk (RR) for viral load suppression (<50 HIV RNA copies/ml and <400 HIV RNA copies/ml), tolerability, and death. Result. Data was extracted from four articles, which included a total of 2381 participants. We found superior viral load suppression among tenofovir (TDF) arm compared to zidovudine (ZDV) arm. Tenofovir arm achieves viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/ml (RR = 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.04, 1.21], I2=0%) higher than zidovudine arm. Similarly TDF arm is superior in viral load suppression to <400 HIV RNA copies/ml (RR = 1.19, 95% CI [1.11, 1.27], I2=0%). Moreover, TDF based regimens were more likely to be tolerated than ZDV based regimens (4 trials, 2381 participants (RR = 1.06, 95% CI [1.02, 1.10], I2=51%)). However, forest plot of death shows that it was not significant (RR = 0.91, 95% CI [0.51, 1.62]). Conclusion. The use of TDF/FTC/EFV as first line regimen for naïve HIV-1 infected adult patient showed superior viral load suppression and tolerability as compared to ZDV/3TC/EFV. In order to compare the death outcome of both ZDV/3TC/EFV and TDF/FTC/EFV further research is needed.;https://www.hindawi.com/journals/art/2017/5792925/;2.5;2.2;3.2;20901240;5792925;;

These agents block a vital step in viral replication: the insertion of viral DNA into the host genome. Key considerations for selection of an INSTI are whether it can be given once daily, if it has to be taken with food, its side effect profile and the risk of the emergence of resistance to the drug. Bictegravir is an INSTI in advanced development which has shown potent, selective inhibition of HIV-1 replication, a reduced potential for the selection of resistance mutations and activity against INSTI-resistant variants through once-daily, unboosted administration. Bictegravir monotherapy in a phase Ib trial and its addition to emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (FTC/TAF) in a phase II study showed the potential for viral suppression with favorable tolerability. A single tablet formulation combining bictegravir and FTC/TAF has reached phase III evaluation, where the primary endpoint has been met in four studies assessing its use in treatment-naive patients and virologically suppressed patients switching from another treatment regimen. A new drug application was submitted to the FDA and another is planned for Europe for the fixed-dose combination.;http://journals.prous.com/journals/servlet/xmlxsl/pk_journals.xml_summary_pr?p_JournalId=2&p_RefId=2681979&p_IsPs=N;0.2;0.2;0.2;03778282;;;

Additionally, the magnitude and trajectory of estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR) changes may differ according to how EGFR is calculated. We described changes in EGFR over time, and the incidence of, and risk factors for, kidney toxicity, in a South African cohort. Methods: We included antiretroviral-naïve patients 16 years old who started tenofovir-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) between 2002 and 2013. We calculated EGFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI), and Cockcroft-Gault equations. We described changes in EGFR from ART initiation using linear mixed effects regression. We described the incidence of EGFR <30 mL/min on treatment, and identified associations with low EGFR using Cox regression. Results: We included 15156 patients with median age of 35.4 years (IQR 29.9-42.0), median CD4 cell count of 168 cells/L (IQR 83-243), and median EGFR (MDRD) of 98.6 mL/min (IQR 84.4-115.6). Median duration of follow up on tenofovir was 12.9 months (IQR 5.1-23.3). Amongst those with a baseline and subsequent EGFR available, mean EGFR change from baseline at 12 months was -4.4 mL/min (95% CI -4.9 to -4.0), -2.3 (-2.5 to -2.1), and 0.6 (0.04 to 1.2) in those with baseline EGFR 90 mL/min; and 11.9 mL/min (11.0 to 12.7), 14.6 (13.5 to 15.7), and 11.0 (10.3 to 11.7) in those with baseline EGFR <90 mL/min, according to the MDRD, CKD-EPI (n = 11 112), and Cockcroft-Gault (n = 9 283) equations, respectively. Overall, 292 (1.9%) patients developed EGFR <30 mL/min. Significant associations with low EGFR included older age, baseline EGFR <60 mL/min, CD4 count <200 cells/L, body weight <60 kg, and concomitant protease inhibitor use. Conclusions: Patients on tenofovir with baseline EGFR 90 mL/min experienced small but significant declines in EGFR over time when EGFR was estimated using the MDRD or CKD-EPI equations. However, EGFR increased in patients with EGFR <90 mL/min, regardless of which estimating equation was used. Decreases to below 30 mL/min were uncommon. In settings with limited access to laboratory testing, monitoring guidelines should consider focusing on higher risk patients.";None;5.5;6.7;7.1;;21317;;

We aimed to assess soft-tissue changes in participants with HIV who had virological failure of a first-line antiretroviral (ART) regimen containing a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor plus two N(t)RTIs and were randomly assigned to receive a second-line regimen containing a boosted protease inhibitor given with either N(t)RTIs or raltegravir. Methods Of the 37 sites that participated in the randomised, open-label, non-inferiority SECOND-LINE study, eight sites from five countries (Argentina, India, Malaysia, South Africa, and Thailand) participated in the body composition substudy. All sites had a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner and all participants enrolled in SECOND-LINE were eligible for inclusion in the substudy. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated allocation schedule, to receive either ritonavir-boosted lopinavir plus raltegravir (raltegravir group) or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir plus two or three N(t)RTIs (N[t]RTI group). Randomisation was stratified by site and screening HIV-1 RNA. Participants and investigators were not masked to group assignment, but allocation was concealed until after interventions were assigned. DXA scans were done at weeks 0, 48, and 96. The primary endpoint was mean percentage and absolute change in peripheral limb fat from baseline to week 96. We did intention-to-treat analyses of available data. This substudy is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01513122. Findings Between Aug 1, 2010, and July 10, 2011, we recruited 211 participants into the substudy. The intention-to-treat population comprised 102 participants in the N(t)RTI group and 108 participants in the raltegravir group, of whom 91 and 105 participants, respectively, reached 96 weeks. Mean percentage change in limb fat from baseline to week 96 was 16·8% (SD 32·6) in the N(t)RTI group and 28·0% (37·6) in the raltegravir group (mean difference 10·2%, 95% CI 0·1–20·4; p=0·048). Mean absolute change was 1·04 kg (SD 2·29) in the N(t)RTI group and 1·81 kg (2·50) in the raltegravir group (mean difference 0·6, 95% CI 0·1 to 1·3; p=0·10). Interpretation Our findings suggest that for people with virological failure of a first-line regimen containing efavirenz plus tenofovir and lamivudine or emtricitabine, the WHO-recommended switch to a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor plus zidovudine (a thymidine analogue nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) and lamivudine might come at the cost of peripheral lipoatrophy. Further study could help to define specific groups of people who might benefit from a switch to an N(t)RTI-sparing second-line ART regimen.

Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.Background High-throughput approaches are increasingly being used to identify genetic associations across multiple phenotypes simultaneously. Here, we describe a pilot analysis that considered multiple on-treatment laboratory phenotypes from antiretroviral therapy-naive patients who were randomized to initiate antiretroviral regimens in a prospective clinical trial, AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol A5202. Participants and methods From among 5 9545 294 polymorphisms imputed genome-wide, we analyzed 2544, including 2124 annotated in the PharmGKB, and 420 previously associated with traits in the GWAS Catalog. We derived 774 phenotypes on the basis of context from six variables: plasma atazanavir (ATV) pharmacokinetics, plasma efavirenz (EFV) pharmacokinetics, change in the CD4+ T-cell count, HIV-1 RNA suppression, fasting low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and fasting triglycerides. Permutation testing assessed the likelihood of associations being by chance alone. Pleiotropy was assessed for polymorphisms with the lowest P-values. Results This analysis included 1181 patients. At P less than 1.5×10 -4, most associations were not by chance alone. Polymorphisms with the lowest P-values for EFV pharmacokinetics (CYPB26 rs3745274), low-density lipoprotein -cholesterol (APOE rs7412), and triglyceride (APOA5 rs651821) phenotypes had been associated previously with those traits in previous studies. The association between triglycerides and rs651821 was present with ATV-containing regimens, but not with EFV-containing regimens. Polymorphisms with the lowest P-values for ATV pharmacokinetics, CD4 T-cell count, and HIV-1 RNA phenotypes had not been reported previously to be associated with that trait. Conclusion Using data from a prospective HIV clinical trial, we identified expected genetic associations, potentially novel associations, and at least one context-dependent association. This study supports high-throughput strategies that simultaneously explore multiple phenotypes from clinical trials' datasets for genetic associations.;http://journals.lww.com/01213011-201703000-00003;4.5;5.0;5.6;17446872;;;

INSTIs are potent inhibitors of the HIV integrase enzyme, with protein binding–adjusted concentration inhibiting viral replication by 90/95 % [IC90/95] values in the low nanogram per millilitre range, and they retain antiviral activity against strains of HIV with acquired resistance to other classes of ARVs. Each of the INSTIs has unique pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties, influencing its role in clinical use in specific subsets of patients. RAL and DTG have minimal drug–drug interaction profiles, as their metabolism has minimal cytochrome P450 (CYP) involvement. Conversely, EVG metabolism occurs primarily via CYP3A4 and requires pharmacokinetic boosting to achieve systemic exposures amenable to once-daily dosing. EVG and DTG have the added benefit of availability of fixed-dose combination tablets, allowing for convenient and simplified ARV regimens. RAL is the only INSTI to be listed as a preferred agent in the current US perinatal treatment guidelines. All three INSTIs are recommended regimens for treatment-naïve individuals in the US adult and adolescent HIV treatment guidelines. This review summarizes and compares the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the INSTIs, and describes specific pharmacokinetic considerations for special patient conditions: hepatic impairment, renal dysfunction, pregnancy and co-infections.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40262-016-0424-1;8.5;8.2;8.8;03125963;;;

As antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs in sub-Saharan Africa mature, increasing numbers of persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection will experience treatment failure, and require second- or third-line ART. Data on second-line failure and development of protease inhibitor (PI) resistance in sub-Saharan Africa are scarce. Methods. HIV-1-infected adults were included if they received >180 days of PI-based second-line ART. We assessed risk factors for having a detectable viral load (VL, 400 cps/mL) using Cox models. If VL was 1000 cps/mL, genotyping was performed. Results. Of 227 included participants, 14.6%, 15.2% and 11.1% had VLs 400 cps/mL at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. Risk factors for a detectable VL were as follows: exposure to nonstandard nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based (hazard ratio, 7.10; 95% confidence interval, 3.40-14.83; P <. 001) or PI-based (7.59; 3.02-19.07; P =. 001) first-line regimen compared with zidovudine/lamivudine/NNRTI, PI resistance at switch (6.69; 2.49-17.98; P <. 001), and suboptimal adherence (3.05; 1.71-5.42; P =. 025). Among participants with VLs 1000 cps/mL, 22 of 32 (69%) harbored drug resistance mutation(s), and 7 of 32 (22%) harbored PI resistance. Conclusions. Although VL suppression rates were high, PI resistance was detected in 22% of participants with VLs 1000 cps/mL. To ensure long-term ART success, intensified support for adherence, VL and drug resistance testing, and third-line drugs will be necessary.";https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiw219;10.4;9.2;9.0;00221899;;;

In 1987, AZT was approved for treating HIV/AIDS. Unfortunately, its clinical usefullness was severly limited by associated toxicities and the emergence of resistance. Three other drugs that were approved in the early 1990s suffered from similar liabilities.In 1990, the Liotta group at Emory University developed a highly diastereoselective synthesis of racemic 3-thia-2,3-dideoxycytidine and 3-thia-2,3-5-fluorodideoxycytidine and demonstrated that these compounds exhibited excellent anti-HIV activity with no apparent cytotoxicity. Subsequently, the enantiomers of these compounds were separated using enzyme-mediated kinetic resolutions and their (-)-enantiomers (3TC and FTC, respectively) were found to have exceptionally attractive preclinical profiles. In addition to their anti-HIV activity, 3TC and FTC potently inhibit the replication of hepatitis B virus.The development of FTC, which was being carried out by Burroughs Wellcome, had many remarkable starts and stops. For example, passage studies indicated that the compound rapidly selected for a single resistant mutant, M184V, and that this strain was 500-1000-fold less sensitive to FTC than was wild-type virus. Fortunately, it was found that combinations of AZT with either 3TC or FTC were synergistic. The effectiveness of AZT-3TC combination therapy was subsequently demonstrated in four independent clinical trials, and in 1997, the FDA approved Combivir, a fixed dose combination of AZT and 3TC.In phase 1 clinical trials, FTC was well tolerated by all subjects with no adverse events observed. However, the development of FTC was halted by the aquistition of Wellcome PLC by Glaxo PLC in January 1995. In 1996, Triangle Pharmaceuticals licensed FTC from Emory and initiated a series of phase I/II clinical studies that demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the drug. In August 1998, FTC was granted ""Fast Track"" status, based primarily on its potential for once daily dosing. While the outcomes of two subsequent phase III trials were positive, a third phase III clinical trial involving combinations of 3TC or FTC with stavudine and neviripine had to be terminated due to serious liver-related adverse events. Although analysis of the data suggested that the liver toxicity was due to neviripine, the FDA decided that the study could not be used for drug registration. Ultimately, in January 2003, Gilead Sciences acquired Triangle Pharmaceuticals and completed the development of FTC (emtricitabine), which was approved for once a day, oral administration in July 2003. A year later, Truvada, a once a day, oral, fixed dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxyl fumarate received FDA approval and quickly became the accepted first line therapy when used with a third antiretroviral agent. In July 2006, the FDA approved Atripla, a once a day, oral, fixed dose combination of emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxyl fumarate, and efavirenz, which represented the culmination of two decades of research that had transformed AIDS from a death sentence to a manageable chronic disease.";https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.accounts.6b00274;36.9;33.6;33.8;00014842;;;

Our objective was to review the evidence for the efficacy and safety of DTG-based first-line regimens compared to efavirenz (EFV)-based regimens. Methods: We conducted a systematic review. We comprehensively searched a range of databases as well as conference abstracts and a trials registry. We used Cochrane methods in screening and data collection and assessed each study's risk of bias with the Cochrane tool. We meta-analyzed data using a fixed-effects model. We used GRADE to assess evidence quality. Results: From 492 search results, we identified two randomized controlled trials, reported in five peer-reviewed articles and one conference abstract. One trial tested two DTG-based regimens (DTG + abacavir (ABC) + lamivudine (3TC) or DTG + tenofovir + emtricitabine) against an EFV-based regimen (EFV+ ABC+3TC). The other trial tested DTG+ABC+3TC against EFV+ABC+3TC. In meta-analysis, DTG-containing regimens were superior to EFV-containing regimens at 48 weeks and at 96 weeks (RR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.04-1.16; and RR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.04-1.21, respectively). In one trial, the DTG-containing regimen was superior at 144 weeks (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.24). DTG-containing regimens were superior in reducing treatment discontinuation compared to those containing EFV at 96 weeks and at 144 weeks (RR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.15-0.50; and RR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.16-0.48, respectively). Risk of serious adverse events was similar in each regimen at 96 weeks (RR = 1.15, 95% CI 0.80-1.63) and 144 weeks (RR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.68-1.29). Risk of bias was moderate overall, as was GRADE evidence quality. Conclusions: DTG-based regimens should be considered in future World Health Organization guidelines for initial HIV treatment.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0162775;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0162775;;

To facilitate analysis of the barrier to resistance at therapeutically relevant ARV concentrations, we performed fixed-dose in vitro HIV-1 drug resistance selection assays using the immortalized MT-2 T-cell line and primary human CD4+ T cells with a panel of FDA-approved ARVs, each at their respective cell culture equivalent clinical trough concentration (CCE Cmin). At high multiples of its CCE Cmin, emtricitabine (FTC) selected for the rapid emergence of M184I/V, a result consistent with resistance emergence in vivo. While the rate of viral breakthrough in the presence of rilpivirine or efavirenz was delayed relative to FTC, both inhibitors selected for virus with known clinically relevant RAMs. No viral breakthrough was observed for the protease inhibitor atazanavir even at subtherapeutic drug concentrations, which is consistent with its previously characterized high in vivo barrier to resistance. Depending on assay conditions, treatment with integrase inhibitors elvitegravir and raltegravir resulted in breakthrough of both resistant and wild-type virus. The RAMs observed in drug selections were not detected above a 2% threshold by deep sequencing in the in vitro virus inoculum, and only rarely in isolates from treatment-naive HIV+ patients. These new viral breakthrough assays facilitate the analysis of multiple experimental replicates and conditions in parallel and provide a rapid quantitative means to evaluate drug resistance emergence at therapeutically relevant drug concentrations, which should facilitate the identification of new ARVs with a high barrier to resistance.;http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2016.0071;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

Despite significant advancement, there remains an opportunity for improvement. One ARV that attempts to fill global HIV therapeutic needs by balancing convenience, safety, and efficacy is elvitegravir (EVG). Areas covered: Using MEDLINE/PubMed, a literature search was conducted for published articles on the safety and efficacy of EVG in the treatment of HIV infection. Expert opinion: EVG offers clinicians a convenient choice for HIV-positive patients that is safe and effective for both treatment-naïve and experienced patients, as well as an option for regimen simplification in virologically suppressed patients. EVG is conveniently co-formulated in fixed dose combination tablets to be taken once daily with food. EVG does not require dose adjustment for patients with severe renal impairment or mild to moderate liver disease. Importantly, EVG requires co-administration with a pharmacokinetic enhancer (i.e., ritonavir or cobicistat) in order to achieve therapeutic levels and facilitate once daily dosing. As a consequence, clinicians must carefully review concomitant medications and navigate potential drug-drug interactions mediated through potent inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A enzymes by ritonavir and cobicistat.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14656566.2016.1250885;5.7;5.6;4.9;14656566;;;

Methods: The HIV-1 pol gene was amplified from 442 newly diagnosed MSM identified as likely recently infected by serological avidity testing in 2011-13. The PCR products were sequenced by next-generation sequencing with a mutation frequency threshold of > 2% and TDR mutations defined according to the 2009 WHO surveillance drug resistance mutations list. Results: The majority (75.6%) were infected with subtype B and 6.6% with rare complex or unique recombinant forms. At a mutation frequency threshold of > 20%, 7.2% (95% CI 5.0%-10.1%) of the sequences had TDR and this doubled to 15.8% (95% CI 12.6%-19.6%) at > 2% mutation frequency (P < 0.0001). The majority (26/42, 62%) of low-frequency variants were against PIs. The most common mutations detected at > 20% and 2%- 20% mutation frequency differed for each drug class, these respectively being: L90M (n=7) and M46IL (n=10) for PIs; T215rev (n=9) and D67GN (n=4) for NRTIs; and K103N (n=5) and G190E (n=2) for NNRTIs. Combined TDR was more frequent in subtype B than non-B (OR=0.38; 95% CI=0.17-0.88; P=0.024) and had minimal predicted effect on recommended first-line therapies.

Methods: SALT is a multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority clinical trial in HIV-1-infected virologically suppressed patients. Hepatitis B virus surface antigen-negative subjects with no previous treatment failure/resistance mutations and HIV-1-RNA <50 copies/mL for 6 months were randomized (1:1) to ATV/r+3TC or ATV/r+2NUCs. The primary endpoint was HIV-1-RNA <50 copies/mL in the PP population. Non-inferiority was demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference was not below 212%. Results: Some 286 patients were analysed. At week 96, 74.4% had HIV-1-RNA <50 copies/mL in the ATV/r+3TC arm versus 73.9% in the ATV/r+2NUCs arm (95% CI for the difference, 29.9%-11.0%). In both groups, similar values were observed for patients with confirmed virological failure in ATV/r+3TC versus ATV/r+2NUCs (9 versus 5), death (1 versus 0), discontinuation due to ART-related toxicity (7 versus 11), withdrawal from the study (7 versus 9) and loss to follow-up (6 versus 6). One patient taking ATV/r+2NUCs developed resistance mutations (M184V and L63P). Similar values were obtained for change in mean CD4 count [19 versus 18 cells/mm3 (95% CI for the difference, 249.3-50.7), grade 3-4 adverse events (70.7% versus 70.2%) and changes in the global deficit score, 20.3 (95% CI, 20.5 to 20.1) for ATV/r+3TC, versus 20.2 (95% CI, 20.4 to 20.1) for ATV/r+2NUCs].

Without antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV DNA peaked at 2 weeks after enrollment, reaching a set-point 2 weeks later with little change thereafter. There was a marked divergence of HIV DNA values between the untreated and treated groups that occurred within the first 2 weeks of ART and increased with time. ART reduced total HIV DNA levels by 20-fold after 2 weeks and 316-fold after 3 years.

Open Access article distributed under the terms of CC BYBackground For HIV-1-infected young people facing lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART), short cycle therapy with long-acting drugs offers potential for drug-free weekends, less toxicity, and better quality-of-life. We aimed to compare short cycle therapy (5 days on, 2 days off ART) versus continuous therapy (continuous ART). Methods In this open-label, non-inferiority trial (BREATHER), eligible participants were aged 8–24 years, were stable on first-line efavirenz with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and had HIV-1 RNA viral load less than 50 copies per mL for 12 months or longer. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to remain on continuous therapy or change to short cycle therapy according to a computer-generated randomisation list, with permuted blocks of varying size, stratified by age and African versus non-African sites; the list was prepared by the trial statistician and randomisation was done via a web service accessed by site clinician or one of the three coordinating trials units. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with confirmed viral load 50 copies per mL or higher at any time up to the 48 week assessment, estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. The trial was powered to exclude a non-inferiority margin of 12%. Analyses were intention to treat. The trial was registered with EudraCT, number 2009-012947-40, ISRCTN, number 97755073, and CTA, number 27505/0005/001-0001. Findings Between April 1, 2011, and June 28, 2013, 199 participants from 11 countries worldwide were randomly assigned, 99 to the short cycle therapy and 100 to continuous therapy, and were followed up until the last patient reached 48 weeks. 105 (53%) were men, median age was 14 years (IQR 12–18), and median CD4 cell count was 735 cells per L (IQR 576–968). Six (6%) patients assigned to the short cycle therapy versus seven (7%) assigned to continuous therapy had confirmed viral load 50 copies per mL or higher (difference 1·2%, 90% CI 7·3 to 4·9, non-inferiority shown). 13 grade 3 or 4 events occurred in the short cycle therapy group and 14 in the continuous therapy group (p=0·89). Two ART-related adverse events (one gynaecomastia and one spontaneous abortion) occurred in the short cycle therapy group compared with 14 (p=0·02) in the continuous therapy group (five lipodystrophy, two gynaecomastia, one suicidal ideation, one dizziness, one headache and syncope, one spontaneous abortion, one neutropenia, and two raised transaminases). Interpretation Non-inferiority of maintaining virological suppression in children, adolescents, and young adults was shown for short cycle therapy versus continous therapy at 48 weeks, with similar resistance and a better safety profile. This short cycle therapy strategy is a viable option for adherent HIV-infected young people who are stable on efavirenz-based ART.

We assessed risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related morbidity and mortality in a cohort of HIV-infected, ART-treated adults in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Methods: Hospital records and mortality data between 2000-2010 were examined for incident CVD-related ICD-10 and Coding of Death in HIV diagnoses among adults 18 years old on ART, enrolled in an observational cohort. Poisson regression models assessed associations between demographic and clinical characteristics and ART agent or class on CVD event risk. Results: Of 2960 eligible persons, 109 had a CVD event (89 hospitalizations, 20 deaths). Participants were 65 % male, 54 % white, and had median age of 37 and 4.6 years on ART. The median nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count was 149 cells/mm3. The virologic suppression rate at the end of study follow-up was 60 %. In multivariable models, detectable HIV-1 RNA prior to the event, prior CVD, less time on ART, age 40 at study baseline, nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count 50 cells/mm3, non-white race, male gender, and a history of hypertension were significantly associated with CVD event incidence (p < 0.05), in order of decreasing strength. In multivariate models, cumulative use of tenofovir, zidovudine, efavirenz and ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, darunavir and/or lopinavir were associated with decreased CVD event risk. Recent tenofovir and boosted atazanavir use were associated with decreased risk, while recent stavudine, nevirapine and unboosted nelfinavir and/or indinavir use were associated with increased CVD event risk. Conclusions: Virologic suppression and preservation of CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts were as important as traditional CVD risk factor burden in determining incident CVD event risk, emphasizing the overall benefit of ART on CVD risk and the need for metabolically-neutral first- and second-line ART in resource-limited settings.;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-016-1735-4;4.5;4.3;4.1;;376;;

A retrospective study was performed on 160 HIV-positive patients (111 receiving antiretroviral therapy [ART] and 49 without ART). Early syphilis diagnosis was made in HIV patients during their follow-up at the HIV/AIDS Unit at a Greek Dermatology and Venereology Unit. The patients’ blood tests were available at the time of diagnosis, as well as before and 12 weeks after early syphilis diagnosis. CD4 T cell counts and VL levels were measured. It was found that syphilis infection had a negative impact on the CD4 T cell counts in both groups, with reduced CD4 T cell counts observed in 84.6% (99/111) and 79.5% (39/49) of patients receiving and not receiving ART, respectively. After treatment for syphilis, CD4 T cell counts returned to pre-treatment levels in most patients, especially those receiving ART. There was a slight and transient VL increase. Patients receiving ART had a 27% increase in VL, compared to 71.4% among patients not receiving ART. Although the VL increase was slight (41–14,000 copies/ml) in the group under treatment, 4–5% (5/111) patients did not return to pre-treatment levels. Moreover, viral mutations associated with treatment resistance were identified in these patients. Early syphilis accelerates and complicates the progression of HIV infection. Early diagnosis and treatment of syphilis may prevent infection-associated complications in most instances. Consequently, prevention of syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections is of great importance for patients infected with HIV.";http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956462415592326;2.5;2.5;2.7;09564624;;;

Methods: Between May 2011 and October 2014, HIV seroconvertors from two tenofovir gel trials were recruited when eligible for ART (CD4+ T-cell count <350 cells/ml, pregnancy or AIDS-defining illness). Women were randomized to tenofovir-containing (tenofovir + lamivudine/emtricitabine + efavirenz) or tenofovir-sparing (zidovudine + lamivudine/emtricitabine + efavirenz) antiretroviral treatment regimens. The proportion with virological suppression, adverse events and drug switches were compared. Results: Fifty-nine women were enrolled and followed-up for median 18 months (IQR 6–24). Twenty-nine women (7 tenofovir gel exposed, 22 tenofovir gel unexposed) were randomized to a tenofovir-containing and 30 (9 tenofovir gel exposed, 21 tenofovir gel unexposed) to a tenofovir-sparing regimen. Median baseline CD4+ T-cell count and viral load (VL) were 345 cells/ml (IQR 280–423) and 4.5 log copies/ml (sd 0.79), and did not differ by ART assignment. Overall VL suppression rates were 88.0% and 78.3% at 6 months (P=0.454) and 85.7% and 79.0% at 12 months (P=0.689) in women on the tenofovir-containing and tenofovir-sparing regimens, respectively. Toxicity-related drug switches were more frequent in women on the tenofovir-sparing than tenofovir-containing regimen (36.7% versus 0.0%, P<0.001). Conclusions: Preliminary data show that tenofovir-containing ART was effective and more tolerable in HIV seroconvertors from tenofovir gel prophylaxis trials and may be considered for use in women with prior tenofovir gel exposure.

To characterize two novel mutations L228I and Y232H in the primer grip of reverse transcriptase (RT) of HIV-1 circulating recombination form 08-BC (CRF08-BC) subtype, both mutant clones were constructed to determine their impacts on viral phenotypic susceptibility and replication capacity (RC). Results showed that the novel mutation, L228I, conferred a low-level resistance to etravirine by itself. L228I in combination with Y188C displayed a high level of cross-resistance to both nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV). The copresence of A139V and Y232H induced a moderate level of resistance to NVP and EFV. Mutations Y188C/L228I, A139V, Y232H, and A139V/Y232H reduced more than 55% of viral RC compared with that of the wild-type (WT) reference virus. Modeling study suggested that the copresence of Y188C/L228I or A139V/Y232H might induce conformational changes to RT, which might result in reduced drug susceptibility and viral RC due to abolished hydrogen bonding or complex interaction with vicinal residues. Our results demonstrated that L228I and Y232H were novel accessory nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance-related mutations and provided valuable information for clinicians to design more effective treatment to patients infected with HIV-1 subtype CRF08-BC.;http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2015.0359;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

The host genetic variability has been shown to play a relevant role in both antiretroviral drugs bioavailability and adverse effects susceptibility. Knowledge about pharmacogenetics role in HIV infection treatment has largely increased over the last years, and is reviewed in the present report, as well as future perspectives for the inclusion of pharmacogenetics information in the directing of HIV infection treatment.;https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/10.2217/pgs-2016-0097;3.9;4.0;3.7;14622416;;;

The chemical structure of elvitegravir is shown in Figure 250.1. Like raltegravir and dolutegravir, elvitegravir is a specific inhibitor of the strand transfer step of HIV integration (DeJesus et al., 2006). As a result, these related molecules are often referred to as strandtransfer inhibitors. In vitro experiments approximate elvitegravir to be greater than two times more potent than raltegravir against HIV-1 integrase-mediated strand transfer (Marinello et al., 2008). Elvitegravir was approved in 2012 as a fixed-dose combination with cobicistat (a pharmacokinetic booster) and emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Stribild, Gilead Sciences) as initial therapy for treatment- naive patients with HIV/AIDS (FDA, 2012). In 2014, the FDA approved elvitegravir (Vitekta, Gilead Sciences) as an individual drug to be used in combination with ritonavirboosted protease inhibitor plus other antiretrovirals for treatment-experienced HIV-positive adults although this has since been discontinued by the manufacturer (FDA, 2014a; Gilead, 201). In 2015, the FDA approved the fixeddose combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafena mide (Genvoya, Gilead Sciences) for the initial treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and to replace current antiretroviral regimens in patients with at least 6 months of virologic suppression (FDA, 2015).";None;0;0;0;;;true;9781498747950

Dolutegravir (DTG, S/GSK1349572), a second-generation drug that overcomes such shortcomings, is under spotlight. The purpose of this study is to review the evidence for DTG use in clinical settings, including its efficacy and safety. Methods: PubMed, EMbase, Ovid, Web of Science, Science Direct, and related websites were screened from establishment until July 2013, and scientific meeting proceedings were manually searched. Two reviewers independently screened 118 citations repeatedly to identify randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of DTG-based regimen with those of RAL- or elvitegravir-based regimens. Using the selected studies with comparable outcome measures and indications, we performed a meta-analysis based on modified intention-to-treat (mITT), on-treatment (OT), and as-treated (AT) virological outcome data. Independent data extraction and quality assessment were conducted. Results: Four unique studies were included with the use of DTG in antiretroviral therapy-naive patients. In therapy-naive patients, DTG combined with abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) or tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) resulted in a significantly better virological outcome with a mITT relative risk (RR)of 1.07 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI 1.03-1.12). Evidence further supported use of DTG had a better virological suppression in the 50 mg once daily group (mITT RR 1.07; 95 % CI 1.03-1.12) as well as in the sub-analysis in dolutegravir/efavirenz(DTG/EFV) and dolutegravir/raltegravir (DTG/RAL) groups (RR 1.09, 95 % CI 1.03-1.15; RR 1.06, 95 % CI 0.98-1.15, respectively). In the matter of safety of DTG-based regimen, the risk of any event was RR 0.98 (95 % CI 0.94-1.01), the risk of serious adverse events (AEs) was RR 0.84 (95 % CI 0.62-1.15), and the risk of drug-related serious AEs was RR 0.33 (95 % CI 0.13-0.79).

The possibility of establishing primary cell lines from FDCs isolated from lymphoid tissue paved the way for characterization of FDC biological properties. We exposed primary FDC cell lines to HIV-1 strains in vitro and studied changes in the chemo-attractive properties of FDCs and release of inflammatory cytokines. Results: FDC lines expressed several known and putative HIV-1 receptors; viral genome was amplified in HIV-1 exposed FDCs which released low levels of p24 HIV-1 protein in culture supernatants, but were not definitely proven to be productively infected. Exposure of FDCs to HIV-1 strains did not change the expression of markers used to characterize these cells. HIV-1 exposed FDCs, however, changed the expression of chemo-attractants involved in cell recruitment at inflammatory sites and increased the production of several inflammatory cytokines. The inflammatory milieu created upon HIV-1 exposure of FDCs led to impaired B cell survival in vitro and reduced Ig production. Conclusions: FDC lines exposed to different HIV-1 strains, although not able to support productive HIV-1 replication, show an increased production of inflammatory cytokines. Our in vitro model of interactions between HIV-1 exposed FDC lines and B cells suggest that exposure of FDCs to HIV-1 in vivo can contribute to inflammation within germinal centers and that this pathological event may impair B cell survival and contribute to impaired B cell responses during HIV-1 infection.";http://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12977-016-0295-4;7.3;6.7;6.7;;61;;

We evaluated factors that might guide monitoring frequency and efforts to prevent treatment failure after initial virologic suppression. Methods: Participants were the 911 HIV-infected antiretroviral-naïve adults with CD4 count <300 cells/L who started efavirenz-based ART in the international A5175/PEARLS trial and achieved HIV-1 RNA <1000 copies/mL at 24 weeks. Participant report of ART adherence was evaluated using a structured questionnaire in monthly interviews. Adherence and readily available clinical and laboratory measures were evaluated as predictors of late virologic failure (late VF: confirmed HIV-1 RNA 1000 copies/mL after 24 weeks). Results: During median follow-up of 3.5 years, 82/911 participants (9%) experienced late VF. Of 516 participants reporting missed doses during the first 24 weeks of ART, 55 (11%) experienced late VF, compared with 27 (7%) of 395 participants reporting no missed doses (hazard ratio: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.73). This difference persisted in multivariable analysis, in which lower pre-ART hemoglobin and absence of Grade 3 laboratory results prior to week 24 were also associated with higher risk of late VF. Discussion: In this clinical trial, the late VF rate after successful suppression was very low. If achievable in routine clinical practice, virologic monitoring involving infrequent (e.g. annual) measurements might be considered; the implications of this for development of resistance need evaluating.

Despite the relative success of HBV vaccination, breakthrough infections can occur infrequently in patients, and it can be due to occult HBV infection, vaccine unresponsiveness and/or emergence of escape mutants. This study assessed the presence of occult HBV infection and S gene escape mutants in HIV-positive patients after HBV vaccination. Ninety-two HIV-positive patients were enrolled in this study, including 52 responders to HBV vaccine and 40 non-responders. All of the cases received HBV vaccine according to routine HBV vaccination protocols. The presence of HBV-DNA was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In HBV-DNA positive samples, the most conserved regions of S gene sequences were amplified by nested PCR and PCR products were sequenced. Occult HBV infection was detected in two cases. Glycine to arginine mutation at residue 145 (G145R) within the ‘a’ region of the S gene was detected in one of the occult HBV infection cases who was in the non-responder group. This study showed that the prevalence of occult HBV infection and vaccine escape mutants was low in our HBV-vaccinated HIV-positive patients in both responder and non-responder groups, so there was no alarming evidence indicating breakthrough HBV infection in our vaccinated HIV-positive cases.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956462415602419;2.5;2.5;2.7;09564624;;;

Here we examine the determinants of HIV RNA suppression below the standard assay threshold (40 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) as well as factors associated with detectable HIV RNA below this reported detection limit. Methods: Between 2007 and 2010, 11 575 consecutive viral load (VL) tests were obtained from 1540 patients, including 356 on effective antiretroviral therapy followed since initiation (1996–2001: n = 165; 2002–2009: n = 191). Analyses modelled the probability of an undetectable VL given successful suppression to < 200 copies/mL, and the probability of residual viraemia given an undetectable result. Results: Detectable HIV RNA amplification was demonstrated in 20% of samples with a VL result < 40 copies/mL. Longitudinal analyses from 356 patients revealed that the likelihood of achieving results < 40 copies/mL was increased with current nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) therapy [odds ratio (OR) 2.0; P < 0.05] and reduced with prior virological rebound (OR 0.5; P < 0.05). In contrast, the presence of detectable HIV RNA < 40 copies/mL was strongly associated with pretreatment HIV RNA levels among those on current protease inhibitor (PI) treatment (OR 1.5 per log10 copies/mL increase; P = 0.02) as well as those on NNRTIs (OR 1.7; P = 0.002). Conclusions: While HIV treatment history was associated with plasma HIV RNA levels below the detection limit, residual viraemia results were dominantly determined by pretreatment VL. These findings support the concept of a stable, long-lived reservoir of latently infected cells as a source of residual viraemia despite effective HIV treatment.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/hiv.12323;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of dual-therapy versus triple therapy as first-line treatment or in treatment simplification. Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Medline, Embase (via OVID), the Cochrane Trial Registry, and major conference proceedings for randomised trials published between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2015. We included studies comparing dual-therapy (from two independent classes) antiretroviral regimens as a first-line or a switch strategy (in virologically suppressed individuals) with standard triple-drug regimens. Our primary outcome was the risk of virological failure (non-completion=failure) at the 48 week timepoint. We did a random-effect meta-analysis to pool the relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) for each of the outcomes. Findings For the primary outcome, we included 21 studies (11 first-line and ten switch studies), providing data for 4821 individuals (2478 in dual-therapy groups and 2343 in control groups). Overall, the RR of failure with dual-therapy compared with triple-therapy (control) groups was 1·14 (95% CI 0·91–1·43). In first-line studies, the RR of failure for dual-therapy versus control groups was 1·17 (0·94–1·47; I2=51%), which reduced to 1·05 (0·86–1·28; I2=26%) on exclusion of maraviroc-containing studies. In switch studies, the RR of failure for dual-therapy versus control groups was 1·21 (0·72–2·02; I2=67%), which reduced to 1·13 (0·64–1·99; I2=61%) after exclusion of maraviroc-containing studies. In patients with a baseline viral load of more than 100 000 copies per mL, RR of failure for dual-therapy versus control groups was 1·24 (1·03–1·49), which reduced to 1·18 (0·94–1·47) on excluding maraviroc-containing studies. We recorded the ORs for dual-therapy versus control groups for serious adverse events (1·16 [0·92–1·48]), adverse events (0·82 [0·52–1·28]), and mutations (2·11 [1·32–3·36]). Interpretation Dual therapy, especially with regimens excluding maraviroc, could be safe and efficacious, particularly in patients with baseline viral loads of less than 100 000 copies per mL. However, dual therapy seems to have a greater risk of selecting resistance mutations compared with standard triple therapy.

An antiretroviral therapy consisting of zidovudine, lamivudine, and lopinavir/ritonavir was started 96 hour after delivery. Raltegravir was added at hour 120, being plasma HIV-1 RNA above 10×106 copies/ml. HIV RNA declined to 5·000 copies/ml at day 30. The second baby was born at week 40.

Diagnosis of EPTB is challenging in resource-limited settings due to difficulties in obtaining samples, as well as the paucibacillarity of the specimens. Skeletal tuberculosis accounts for 10-35 % of EPTB cases, with vertebral osteomyelitis (Pott's disease) representing 50 % of the cases. We present two cases of suspected Pott's disease, diagnosed through GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay in urine at a rural Tanzanian hospital. Case Presentation: Case I A 49-year old male, HIV-1 positive, on co-formulated tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine/efavirenz since 2009 and CD4 counts of 205 cells/L (13 %). He presented with lower back pain and progressive lower limb weakness for two weeks prior to admission. The physical examination revealed bilateral flaccid paraplegia with reduced reflexes, but otherwise unremarkable findings. A lateral lumbar X-ray showed noticeable reduction of intervertebral space between L4 and L5, and a small calcification in the anterior longitudinal ligament between L4 and L5, being compatible with focal spondylosis deformans but inconclusive with regard to tuberculous spondylitis. An abdominal ultrasound showed normal kidneys, bladder and prostate gland. The urinalysis and complete blood counts (CBC) were normal. M. Tuberculosis was detected through GeneXpert MTB/RIF in centrifuged urine, with no resistance to rifampicin. Case II A 76-year old female, HIV-1 negative, presented with lower back pain and progressive weakness and numbness of the lower limbs for two months prior to admission. The physical examination revealed paraplegia, but otherwise unremarkable findings. The lumbosacral X-ray findings were compatible with spondylosis deformans of the lumbar spine and possible tuberculous spondylitis in L3-L4. The abdominal and renal ultrasound showed normal kidneys and bladder. The urinalysis and CBC were normal. M. Tuberculosis was detected through GeneXpert MTB/RIF in centrifuged urine, with no resistance to rifampicin. Conclusion: We report two cases of suspected tuberculous spondylitis diagnosed through Xpert MTB/RIF in urine samples from a rural Tanzanian hospital. Urine testing using Xpert MTB/RIF reflects disseminated disease and renal involvement, and may offer a feasible additional diagnostic approach for Pott's disease in rural Africa.;http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-016-1844-0;4.5;4.3;4.1;;514;;

Setting: A public health antenatal programme responsible for screening 90 000 pregnant women per year for nine different infectious diseases in Central Western Brazil. Participants: 96 young pregnant women (15.24 years) infected with HIV-1. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Standard interviews and blood samples were taken at the time of recruitment, at the first medical appointment after confirmation of diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, and before ARV prophylaxis initiation. Clinical and laboratory data were retrieved from medical files. HIV-1 pol gene sequences (entire protease/PR, partial reverse transcriptase/RT) were obtained from plasma RNA. ARV resistance mutations (CPR/Stanford HIV-1; International AIDS Society-USA databases) were identified. Results: The median age was 21 years; most reported < 8 years education; 73% were recently diagnosed. Approximately 20% (19/96) presented late for antenatal care (after 26 gestational weeks), while 49% reported  2 previous pregnancies. Possible heterosexual transmission by an HIV-1 infected partner (17%) and commercial sex work (2%) were reported. The median of CD4 cell count was 526 cells/mm3; the median viral load was: 10 056 copies/mL in ARV-naive (48/96) patients and 5881 copies/mL in ARV-exposed (48/96) patients. Two probable seroconversion cases during pregnancy were identified in adolescents. One motherto-child transmission case (1.0%) was observed. Transmitted drug resistance among ARV-naive patients was 9.3% (CI 95% 3.3% to 19.6%); secondary drug resistance among ARV-exposed patients was 12.5% (CI 95% 4.7% to 25.6%). Conclusions: Despite high access to antenatal care, the low socioeconomic-educational profiles seen in these young HIV-1-infected women highlight the necessity of improved public health educational and preventive strategies regarding HIV infection and early unplanned pregnancy.";https://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010837;3.7;3.6;3.5;;e010837;;

The prevalence of HIV primary resistance mutations down to the level of 1% minor variants was investigated using ultradeep pyrosequencing (UDPS) in HIV-positive Korean blood donors and in treatment naïve chronic patients for the comparison. The entire pol region was sequenced from 25 HIV-positive blood donors, and 18 treatment-naïve chronic HIV patients. UDPS was successful in 19 blood donors and 18 chronic patients. In total, 1,011,338 sequence reads were aligned, and 28,093 sequence reads were aligned on average per sample. The prevalence of HIV primary resistance mutations in the HIV-positive blood donors and chronic HIV patients were 63.2% and 44.4% according to UDPS, respectively. Protease inhibitor (PI) drugs demonstrated different patterns in HIV-positive blood donors and chronic HIV patients, whereas non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), and integrase inhibitor (INI) drugs showed similar patterns between the two groups. Higher level of primary resistance prevalence was observed mainly because UDPS method could detect mutations in minor variants with 1-10% frequency. The higher resistance prevalence was observed in HIV-positive blood donors than in chronic patients. Considering that treatments for HIV-infected patients were recently amended to start at an earlier stage, information about degree of drug resistance to each drug between the two groups would help to establish future policies, design additional clinical trials, assess HIV patient care in Korea.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166093415300483;3.5;3.3;3.4;01660934;;;

OBJECTIVE: To provide updated recommendations for the use of antiretroviral therapy in adults (aged 18 years) with established HIV infection, including when to start treatment, initial regimens, and changing regimens, along with recommendations for using ARVs for preventing HIV among those at risk, including preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis. EVIDENCE REVIEW: A panel of experts in HIV research and patient care convened by the International Antiviral Society-USA reviewed data published in peer-reviewed journals, presented by regulatory agencies, or presented as conference abstracts at peer-reviewed scientific conferences since the 2014 report, for new data or evidence that would change previous recommendations or their ratings. Comprehensive literature searches were conducted in the PubMedand EMBASE databases through April 2016. Recommendations were by consensus, and each recommendation was rated by strength and quality of the evidence. FINDINGS: Newer data support the widely accepted recommendation that antiretroviral therapy should be started in all individuals with HIV infection with detectable viremia regardless of CD4 cell count. Recommended optimal initial regimens for most patients are 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (InSTI). Other effective regimens include nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or boosted protease inhibitors with 2 NRTIs. Recommendations for special populations and in the settings of opportunistic infections and concomitant conditions are provided. Reasons for switching therapy include convenience, tolerability, simplification, anticipation of potential new drug interactions, pregnancy or plans for pregnancy, elimination of food restrictions, virologic failure, or drug toxicities. Laboratory assessments are recommended before treatment, and monitoring during treatment is recommended to assess response, adverse effects, and adherence. Approaches are recommended to improve linkage to and retention in care are provided. Daily tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine is recommended for use as preexposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV infection in persons at high risk. When indicated, postexposure prophylaxis should be started as soon as possible after exposure. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Antiretroviral agents remain the cornerstone of HIV treatment and prevention. All HIV-infected individuals with detectable plasma virus should receive treatment with recommended initial regimens consisting of an InSTI plus2 NRTIs. Preexposure prophylaxis should be considered as part of an HIV prevention strategy for at-risk individuals. When used effectively, currently available ARVs can sustain HIV suppression and can prevent new HIV infection. With these treatment regimens, survival rates among HIV-infected adults who are retained in care can approach those of uninfected adults.;http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.2016.8900;39.0;30.2;26.3;00987484;;;

Head-to-head efficacy data comparing TDF/FTC + EFV, TDF/FTC + ATV/r, ABC/3TC + EFV, and ABC/3TC + ATV/r were obtained from ACTG 5202 for up to 192 weeks. Antiretroviral drug costs were based on current list prices. Other medical costs (2013 UK pounds sterling), utility values, and mortality rates were obtained from published sources. Base-case, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses (by baseline viral load) were conducted. Results: Individuals using TDF/FTC-based regimens were predicted to remain on first-line therapy longer and accrue more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) than individuals using ABC/3TC-based regimens. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of £30 000 per QALY gained, TDF/FTC-based regimens were predicted to be cost-effective compared with ABC/3TC-based regimens, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of £23 355 for TDF/FTC + EFV vs. ABC/3TC + EFV and £23 785 for TDF/FTC + ATV/r vs. ABC/3TC + ATV/r. Results were generally robust in subgroup, sensitivity, and scenario analyses. Conclusions: In an analysis of the regimens studied in ACTG 5202 for treatment-naïve adults with HIV-1 infection in the UK, TDF/FTC-based regimens yielded more favourable health outcomes and were generally predicted to be cost-effective compared with ABC/3TC-based regimens. These results confirm that TDF/FTC-based regimens are not only clinically effective but also cost-effective.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/hiv.12349;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;

Lazenby et al.Objective. To compare HIV drug resistance in pregnant women with perinatal HIV (PHIV) and those with nonperinatal HIV (NPHIV) infection. Methods. We conducted a multisite cohort study of PHIV and NPHIV women from 2000 to 2014. Sample size was calculated to identify a fourfold increase in antiretroviral (ARV) drug resistance in PHIV women. Continuous variables were compared using Student's t -test and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Categorical variables were compared using  2 and Fisher's exact tests. Univariate analysis was used to determine factors associated with antiretroviral drug resistance. Results. Forty-one PHIV and 41 NPHIV participants were included. Women with PHIV were more likely to have drug resistance than those with NPHIV ((55% versus 17%, p = 0.03), OR 6.0 (95% CI 1.0-34.8), p = 0.05), including multiclass resistance (15% versus 0, p = 0.03), and they were more likely to receive nonstandard ARVs during pregnancy (27% versus 5%, p = 0.01). PHIV and NPHIV women had similar rates of preterm birth (11% versus 28%, p = 0.08) and cesarean delivery (47% versus 46%, p = 0.9). Two infants born to a single NPHIV woman acquired HIV infection. Conclusions. PHIV women have a high frequency of HIV drug resistance mutations, leading to nonstandard ARVs use during pregnancy. Despite nonstandard ARV use during pregnancy, PHIV women did not experience increased rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes.;http://www.hindawi.com/journals/idog/2016/4897501/;2.5;3.8;4.7;10647449;4897501;;

All rights reserved.Background: Virus-specific CD8+ T-cell responses are believed to play an important role in the control of HIV-1 infection; however, what constitutes an effective HIV-1 CD8+ T-cell response remains a topic of debate. The ex vivo viral suppressive capacity was measured of CD8+ T cells from 44 HIV-1-positive individuals. The phenotypic and cytokine profiles, and also the specificity of the CD8+ T cells, were correlated with the suppression of HIV-1 replication. We also aimed to determine whether antiretroviral therapy (ART) had any positive effect on the HIV-1 suppressive CD8+ T cells. Method: Ex vivo suppression assay was used to evaluate the ability of CD8+ T cells to suppress HIV-1 replication in autologous CD4 + T cells. The CD107a, interferon-, interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1) responses to HIV-1 were evaluated by intracellular staining. The phenotypic profile of CD8+ T cells was determined by whole blood staining. Results: The expression of CD57 on effector CD8+ T cells correlated with the suppression of HIV-1 replication and to the duration of ART. CD107a and tumor necrosis factor- expression levels were significantly higher in individuals with ex vivo suppressive activity compared with individuals without suppressive activity. Conclusions: Standard in vitro assays measuring one or several cytokines do not correlate with the functional viral suppressive capacity of CD8+ T cells from HIV-1-positive individuals. The best correlation of viral suppression was found to be CD57 expression. CD57 expression correlated with the duration of ART, suggesting that ART restores the cytotoxic capacity of CD8+ T lymphocytes.";http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201601010-00002;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

Nine men who began antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 18 months of seroconversion and had sustained plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for at least 6 months were enrolled. Median age was 38 years, median pre-ART HIV-1 RNA was 140,000 copies/ml and mean baseline CD4 count was 755/l. Two DNA, followed by 2 MVA, inoculations were given 8 weeks apart. Eight subjects completed all vaccinations and TI. Clinical and laboratory adverse events were generally mild, with no serious or grade 4 events. Only reactogenicity events were considered related to study drug. No treatment emergent viral resistance was seen. The vaccinations did not reduce viral reservoirs and virus re-emerged in all participants during TI, with a median time to re-emergence of 4 weeks. Eight of 9 participants had CD8+ T cells that could be stimulated by vaccine-matched Gag peptides prior to vaccination. Vaccinations boosted these responses as well as eliciting previously undetected CD8+ responses. Elicited T cells did not display signs of exhaustion. During TI, temporal patterns of viral re-emergence and Gag-specific CD8+ T cell expansion suggested that vaccine-specific CD8+ T cells had been stimulated by re-emergent virus in only 2 of 8 participants. In these 2, transient decreases in viremia were associated with Gag selection in known CD8+ T cell epitopes. We hypothesize that escape mutations, already archived in the viral reservoir, plus a poor ability of CD8+ T cells to traffic to and control virus at sites of re-emergence, limited the therapeutic efficacy of the DNA/MVA vaccine.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0163164;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0163164;;

A modeling approach that assesses the merits of such policies in terms of lifelong costs and health outcomes using adherence and effectiveness data from real-world U.S. settings. Methods A comprehensive computer-based microsimulation model was developed to assess the lifetime health (life expectancy and quality adjusted life-years-QALYs) and economic outcomes in HIV-1 infected patients initiating STRs compared with multiple-table regimens including generic medications where possible (gMTRs). The STRs considered included tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine and efavirenz or rilpivirine or elvitegravir/cobicistat. gMTRs substitutions included each counterpart to STRs, including generic lamivudine for emtricitabine and generic versus branded efavirenz. Results: Life expectancy is estimated to be 1.301 years higher (discounted 0.619 QALY gain) in HIV-1 patients initiating a single-tablet regimen in comparison to a generic-based multiple-table regimen. STRs were associated with an average increment of $26,547.43 per patient in medication and $1,824.09 in other medical costs due to longer survival which were partially offset by higher inpatients costs ($12,035.61) with gMTRs treatment. Overall, STRs presented incremental lifetime costs of $16,335.91 compared with gMTRs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $26,383.82 per QALY gained. Conclusions: STRs continue to represent good value for money under contemporary cost-effectiveness thresholds despite substantial price reductions of generic medications in the U.

Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.Background. Virologic failure in subtype C is characterized by high resistance to first-line antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, including efavirenz, nevirapine, and lamivudine, with nucleoside resistance including type 2 thymidine analog mutations, K65R, a T69del, and M184V. However, genotypic algorithms predicting resistance are mainly based on subtype B viruses and may under- or overestimate drug resistance in non-B subtypes. To explore potential treatment strategies after first-line failure, we compared genotypic and phenotypic susceptibility of subtype C human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) following first-line ARV failure. Methods. AIDS Clinical Trials Group 5230 evaluated patients failing an initial nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) regimen in Africa and Asia, comparing the genotypic drug resistance and phenotypic profile from the PhenoSense (Monogram). Site-directed mutagenesis studies of K65R and T69del assessed the phenotypic impact of these mutations. Results. Genotypic algorithms overestimated resistance to etravirine and rilpivirine, misclassifying 28% and 32%, respectively. Despite K65R with the T69del in 9 samples, tenofovir retained activity in >60%. Reversion of the K65R increased susceptibility to tenofovir and other nucleosides, while reversion of the T69del showed increased resistance to zidovudine, with little impact on other NRTI. Conclusions. Although genotype and phenotype were largely concordant for first-line drugs, estimates of genotypic resistance to etravirine and rilpivirine may misclassify subtype C isolates compared to phenotype.;https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiv383;10.4;9.2;9.0;00221899;;;

All rights reserved.Purpose of review To review current data on HIV-1 resistance arising from the use of fixed dose combination tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV-1 infection. Recent findings Resistance to tenofovir (TNV) or FTC is infrequently selected by TDF/FTC PrEP if started before HIV-1 infection has occurred, but is much more common when inadvertently started during undiagnosed acute infection. Mathematical modeling predicts that the number of HIV-1 infections averted by the use of PrEP far exceeds the increase in drug-resistant infections that could occur from PrEP. Studies in macaques show that TNV-resistant virus but not FTC-resistant virus can cause breakthrough infection despite TDF/FTC PrEP. FTC resistance with M184V/I occurs more frequently than TFV resistance with K65R in seroconverters from clinical trials of TDF/FTC PrEP. Summary The benefit of preventing HIV-1 infections with TDF/FTC PrEP far outweighs the risk of drug-resistant infection, provided PrEP is not started in persons with undiagnosed HIV-1 infection. We should respect but not fear HIV-1 resistance from TDF/FTC PrEP and recognize that most TNV or FTC resistance will arise from its use for antiretroviral therapy (ART). Preventing ART failure or detecting it early is most important for preventing the spread of HIV-1 resistance to TDF/FTC and preserving its effectiveness for both PrEP and ART.;http://journals.lww.com/01222929-201601000-00009;7.5;7.2;7.8;1746630X;;;

The study was conducted at a tertiary care center including 826 HIV-1 seropositive individuals undergoing ART for at least six months. Plasma viral load (HIV-1 RNA) was detected by Real Time PCR and CD4+ T-lymphocyte (CD4+) counts were estimated by flow cytometry. The mean CD4+ count of patients was 501 (95% CI = 325-579) cells/cumm, but about 35% of patients had CD4+ T cell counts below 350 cells/cumm. With increasing age, average CD4+ count was found to be decreasing (p = 0.005). Of the total cases, 82 (9.92%) were found to have virological failure (viral load: >1000 copies/ml). Tenofovir/Lamivudine/Efavirenz (TDF/3TC/EFV), the frequently used ART regimen in Nepal, showed virological failure in 11.34% and immunological failure in 37.17% of patients. Virological failure rate was higher among children < 15 years (14.5%) (p = 0.03); however, no association was observed between ART outcomes and gender or route of transmission. The study suggests there are still some chances of virological and immunological failures despite the success of highly active ART (HAART).";http://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2016/6817325/;5.1;4.3;3.6;23146133;6817325;;

We conducted a cross-sectional survey in Jiangsu province to determine the level of drug resistance (DR) in HIV-1 infected patients and the correlates of DR in virological failures in 2012. Approximately 10.4% of the HIV-1 patients in the study experienced virological failure after one year of ART and were divided into drug sensitive and drug resistant groups based on genotype determination. The viral loads (VLs) in the drug resistant group were significantly lower than the drug sensitive group. There were two independent predictors of virological failure: male gender and increasing duration of treatment. The primary mutations observed in the study were against nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) which were M184V (79.45%) and K103N (33.70%) in nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). The overall rate of DR in Jiangsu province is still relatively low among treated patients.

Among the 2472 uncensored patients before M12, 962 (39%) had a baseline viral load 100 000 copies/mL of whom 294 were in treatment failure at or before M12. Our analyses showed no difference between ABC/3TC and TDF/FTC in the risk of treatment failure at M12 in patients starting an ARV regimen with a high viral load (100 000 copies/mL). Conclusions: Using a large prospectively collected cohort of patients seeking care in France, we found no evidence that ABC/3TC based regimens led to more failures than TDF/FTC based ones in patients with high baseline viral loads.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of BMS-986001 versus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in treatment-naive patients with HIV-1. Methods: In this phase 2b, randomised, active-controlled trial (AI467003), we recruited treatment-naive (no current or previous exposure to an antiretroviral drug for >1 week) adults (aged at least 18 years) with HIV-1 from 47 sites across Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, South Africa, and South America. Patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA greater than 5000 copies per mL and CD4 counts greater than 200 cells per L were randomly assigned (2:2:2:3) to receive BMS-986001 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg once a day or to receive tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg once a day; each allocation was given with efavirenz 600 mg once a day and lamivudine 300 mg once a day. Both patients and investigators were masked to BMS-986001 dose (achieved with similar looking placebo tablets), but not allocation up to and including week 48. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL and safety events (serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation) through week 24; the main analysis was with a modified intention-to-treat population. Resistance analysis was a secondary endpoint, and additional safety parameters were exploratory endpoints. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01489046, and the European Clinical Trials Database, number EudraCT 2011-003329-89. Findings: Patients were recruited between Jan 25, 2012, and Oct 3, 2012; 757 patients were assessed for eligibility and 301 were randomly assigned to receive either BMS-986001 once a day (67 patients to 100 mg, 67 to 200 mg, and 66 to 400 mg) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n=101). 297 patients received at least one dose of study drug. At week 24, 57 (88%) of 65 patients for whom there were data in the 100 mg group, 54 (81%) of 67 in the 200 mg group, 62 (94%) of 66 in the 400 mg group achieved HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL, compared with 88 (89%) of 99 in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (modified intention-to-treat population). BMS-986001 was generally well tolerated through week 48. Two patients had BMS-986001-related serious adverse events (atypical drug eruption and thrombocytopenia) and two in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group had study drug-related serious adverse events (potential drug-induced liver injury and depression or lipodystrophy) that led to discontinuation. NRTI resistance-associated mutations were reported in four (2%) of 198 patients, and non-NRTI mutations in 17 (9%) of 198 patients receiving BMS-986001 versus none of 99 and one (1%) of 99 patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, respectively. Compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, individuals in the BMS-986001 groups showed a smaller decrease in lumbar spine and hip bone mineral density but greater accumulation of limb and trunk fat, subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, and increased total cholesterol. Interpretation: BMS-986001 had similar efficacy to that of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and was associated with a smaller decrease in bone mineral density; however, greater resistance and gains in both peripheral and central fat accumulation were recorded for the investigational drug. Bristol-Myers Squibb has discontinued its involvement in the development of BMS-986001, and future decisions on development will be made by Oncolys BioPharma.

To help assess the current situation in Italy, the dynamics of drug resistance mutations in pol and integrase genes in plasma samples from HIV-1-positive patients attending Sapienza University Hospital, Rome, from 2003 to 2014 were analysed. In total, 1730 genotype resistance tests (GRTs) were retrospectively analysed. The prevalence of major drug resistance mutations (DRMs) was evaluated over time in the global population and in patients with antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure. Population dynamics, changes in ART administration, and HIV-1 RNA levels were analysed in combination with DRM trends. The global population showed a strong reduction in major DRMs to all drug classes. Over the 2003-2014 decade, resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) declined from 80.0% to 18.7%, from 42.8% to 20.1% and from 74.2% to 8.3%, respectively (P < 0.005 for all comparisons). However, only PI-associated mutations showed a significant decrease in patients experiencing ART failure. Interestingly, analysis of the integrase gene disclosed an increased resistance to integrase inhibitors, mainly regarding N155H, detected in 32.6% of raltegravir-treated patients in 2012-2014. In conclusion, in line with previous findings, this study shows that drug resistance is declining in Italy. However, the persistence of DRMs to NRTIs and NNRTIs suggests that despite adherence and treatment optimisation, some patients still experience therapy failure, emphasising the need for GRTs both in naïve and ART-failed patients.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2213716515000855;2.0;2.6;3.5;22137165;;;

Information on treatment outcome in such areas is still very limited notably due to additional difficulties to manage ART in these areas. Results: 387 HIV-1 infected adults (18 years) were consecutively enrolled when attending healthcare services for their routine medical visit at 12 or 24 months on first-line ART in five HIV care centers (four semi-rural and one rural). Among them, 102 patients were on first-line ART for 12 ± 2 months (M12) and 285 for 24 ± 2 months (M24). Virological failure was observed in 70 (18.1 %) patients ranging from 13.9 to 31.6 % at M12 and from 8.1 to 22.4 % at M24 across the different sites. For 67/70 patients, sequencing was successful and drug resistance mutations were observed in 65 (97 %). The global prevalence of drug resistance in the study population was thus at least 16.8 % (65/387). Moreover, 32 (8.3 %) and 27 (6.9 %) patients were either on a completely ineffective ART regime or with only a single drug active. Several patients accumulated high numbers of mutations and developed also cross-resistance to abacavir, didanosine or the new NNRTI drugs like etravirine and rilpivirine. Conclusion: The observations on ART treatment outcome from ART clinics in semi-rural areas are close to previous observations in Lomé, the capital city suggesting that national ART-programme management plays a role in treatment outcome.;http://www.aidsrestherapy.com/content/12/1/38;3.2;3.8;4.4;;38;;

It contains darunavir, a well-known protease inhibitor with a good efficacy and safety profile, and the new pharmacokinetic enhancer cobicistat. The convenience of this combination in a single pill makes this compound easier to take, thus improving adherence.Areas covered: PubMed and www.clinicaltrials.gov were searched with the term ""darunavir/cobicistat"" for all clinical trials conducted up to date, as well as for those ongoing and to be opened in the near future as well as for pharmacology data. A review of abstracts from major infectious diseases (particularly those dedicated to human immunodeficiency disease) and pharmacology conferences from 2010 to 2015 was also conducted.Expert opinion: improving adherence, particularly by minimizing pill burden with convenient formulations (i.e., fixed-dose combination), is one of the major objectives of modern antiretroviral treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus disease. Cobicistat is an alternative agent to ritonavir for boosting plasma drug levels for several antiretrovirals. Darunavir co-administered with low-dose ritonavir, in combination with other antiretrovirals, is recommended in several guidelines for treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency disease. Darunavir/cobicistat fixed-dose combination allows for a once-daily treatment regimen with a reduced pill burden. This new co formulation makes this compound easier to take, thus improving adherence.";http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1517/14656566.2015.1109632;5.7;5.6;4.9;14656566;;;

An understanding of the sociodemographic and immunological conditions that influence resistance to HIV is a challenge, and very little is known about the role of intrinsic antiviral factors that restrict HIV infection. The aim of this study was to analyze potential factors responsible for resistance to HIV infection in serodiscordant couples by comparing HIV-exposed seronegative individuals (HESN) to HIV-seropositive individuals treated with antiretroviral therapy (HIV-ART) along with healthy controls (HC). The results revealed one HLA-B27 and two HLA-B57 individuals among the HESN; a CCR532 heterozygous deletion was observed in one serodiscordant couple, while the homozygous genotype for this variant was not observed. There were no differences in the basal mRNA expression of APOBEC3G, CFLAR, TRIM5, LEDGF/p75, BST-2, or SAMHD1 in CD4+ T lymphocyte- and monocyte-enriched populations among the three groups, and lower HBD-3 concentrations were observed in saliva from HIV-ART compared to HESN and HC. The most prevalent HIV-1 subtype was C or C-containing recombinant forms. Six HIV-ART individuals and one HIV-ART individual were infected with the R5 HIV and X4 HIV strains, respectively. The ability to control infection or delay disease progression is probably defined by a balance between viral and host factors, and further evaluation should be performed in larger cohorts. Our data suggest that susceptibility to HIV infection varies among individuals and strengthens the multifactorial characteristics underlying the resistance mechanisms in HIV.";http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2015.0168;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

Neurological disease remains common in treated HIV, however, due in part to ongoing inflammation and immune activation that persist in chronic infection. In this review, we highlight recent developments in our understanding of several clinically relevant neurologic complications that can occur in HIV infection despite treatment, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, symptomatic CSF escape, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral neuropathy.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11910-016-0666-1;5.7;6.1;6.4;15284042;62;;

In patients who have never experienced virologic failure while receiving ARV therapy and who have no evidence of drug resistance, switching to any of the acceptable US Department of Health and Human Services first-line therapies is expected to maintain virologic suppression. However, in virologically suppressed patients with a history of virologic failure or drug resistance, it can be more challenging to change therapy while still maintaining virologic suppression. In these patients, it may be difficult to know whether the discontinuation of one of the ARVs in a suppressive regimen constitutes the removal of a key regimen component that will not be adequately supplanted by one or more substituted ARVs. In this article, we review many of the clinical scenarios requiring ARV therapy modification in patients with stable virologic suppression and outline the strategies for modifying therapy while maintaining long-term virologic suppression.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40265-015-0515-6;9.4;9.2;9.6;00126667;;;

Efficacy studies of these combinations also considering pill numbers, dosing frequencies and ethnicities are rare.METHODS: We included patients starting first-line combination ART (cART) with or switching from first-line cART without treatment failure to tenofovir/emtricitabine, abacavir/lamivudine, tenofovir/lamivudine and zidovudine/lamivudine plus efavirenz or nevirapine. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to investigate the effect of the different NRTI combinations on two primary outcomes: virological failure (VF) and emergence of NRTI resistance. Additionally, we performed a pill burden analysis and adjusted the model for pill number and dosing frequency.RESULTS: Failure events per treated patient for the four NRTI combinations were as follows: 19/1858 (tenofovir/emtricitabine), 9/387 (abacavir/lamivudine), 11/344 (tenofovir/lamivudine) and 45/1244 (zidovudine/lamivudine). Compared with tenofovir/emtricitabine, abacavir/lamivudine had an adjusted HR for having VF of 2.01 (95% CI 0.86-4.55), tenofovir/lamivudine 2.89 (1.22-6.88) and zidovudine/lamivudine 2.28 (1.01-5.14), whereas for the emergence of NRTI resistance abacavir/lamivudine had an HR of 1.17 (0.11-12.2), tenofovir/lamivudine 11.3 (2.34-55.3) and zidovudine/lamivudine 4.02 (0.78-20.7). Differences among regimens disappeared when models were additionally adjusted for pill burden. However, non-white patients compared with white patients and higher pill number per day were associated with increased risks of VF and emergence of NRTI resistance: HR of non-white ethnicity for VF was 2.85 (1.64-4.96) and for NRTI resistance 3.54 (1.20-10.4); HR of pill burden for VF was 1.41 (1.01-1.96) and for NRTI resistance 1.72 (0.97-3.02).CONCLUSIONS: Although VF and emergence of resistance was very low in the population studied, tenofovir/emtricitabine appears to be superior to abacavir/lamivudine, tenofovir/lamivudine and zidovudine/lamivudine. However, it is unclear whether these differences are due to the substances as such or to an association of tenofovir/emtricitabine regimens with lower pill burden.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dkv257;8.7;7.7;8.3;;;;

We assessed the effect of disulfiram on HIV transcription in a dose-escalation study. Methods In this prospective dose-escalation study, to optimise disulfiram exposure we included adults with HIV on suppressive antiretroviral therapy, with plasma HIV RNA of less than 50 copies per mL and a CD4 cell count greater than 350 cells per L. Participants were allocated sequentially to one of three dosing groups (500 mg, 1000 mg, and 2000 mg) and received disulfiram daily for 3 days. Only the staff who did laboratory assays were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was change in cell-associated unspliced HIV RNA in CD4 cells. The primary analysis method was a negative binomial regression, with the number of copies as the outcome variable and the input total RNA or plasma volume as an exposure variable, which is equivalent to modelling copies or input. We used these models to estimate changes from before disulfiram to timepoints during and after disulfiram administration. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01944371. Findings Of 34 participants screened for eligibility at The Alfred Hospital (Melbourne, VIC, Australia), and San Francisco General Hospital (San Francisco, CA, USA), 30 people were enrolled between Sept 24, 2013, and March 31, 2014. The estimated fold increases in cell-associated unspliced HIV RNA from baseline were 1·7 (95% CI 1·3–2·2; p<0·0001) to the timepoint during disulfiram treatment and 2·1 (1·5–2·9; p<0·0001) to the timepoint after disulfiram in the 500 mg group; 1·9 (1·6–2·4; p<0·0001) and 2·5 (1·9–3·3; p<0·0001) in the 1000 mg group; and 1·6 (1·2–2·1; p=0·0026) and 2·1 (1·5–3·1; p=0·0001) in the 2000 mg group. No deaths occurred, and no serious adverse events were noted. Disulfiram was well tolerated at all doses. Interpretation Short-term administration of disulfiram resulted in increases in cell-associated unspliced HIV RNA at all doses, consistent with activating HIV latency. Disulfiram may be suited for future studies of combination and prolonged therapy to activate latent HIV.

However, in most resource-limited countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, ART is started too late to have an effect with substantial early morbidity and mortality, and in high tuberculosis burden settings ART does not reduce the tuberculosis risk to that reported in individuals not infected with HIV. Co-trimoxazole preventive therapy started before or with ART, irrespective of CD4 cell count, reduces morbidity and mortality with benefits that continue indefinitely. Isoniazid preventive therapy as an adjunct to ART prevents tuberculosis in high-exposure settings, with long-term treatment likely to be needed to sustain this benefit. Unfortunately, both preventive therapies are underused in low-income and high-burden settings. ART development has benefited from patient-centred simplification with several effective regimens now available as a one per day pill. We argue that co-trimoxazole and isoniazid should also be combined into a single fixed-dose pill, along with pyridoxine (vitamin B6), that would be taken once per day to help with individual uptake and national scale-up of therapies.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S147330991500242X;31.6;31.9;32.4;14733099;;;

Genotypic drug resistance testing could facilitate the choice of initial ART in areas with rising transmitted drug resistance (TDR) and enable care-providers to determine which individuals with virological failure (VF) on a first- or second-line ART regimen require a change in treatment. An inexpensive near point-of-care (POC) genotypic resistance test would be useful in settings where the resources, capacity, and infrastructure to perform standard genotypic drug resistance testing are limited. Such a test would be particularly useful in conjunction with the POC HIV-1 viral load tests that are currently being introduced in LMICs. A POC genotypic resistance test is likely to involve the use of allele-specific point mutation assays for detecting drug-resistance mutations (DRMs). This study proposes that two major nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-associated DRMs (M184V and K65R) and four major NNRTI-associated DRMs (K103N, Y181C, G190A, and V106M) would be the most useful for POC genotypic resistance testing in LMIC settings. One or more of these six DRMs was present in 61.2% of analyzed virus sequences from ART-naïve individuals with intermediate or high-level TDR and 98.8% of analyzed virus sequences from individuals on a first-line NRTI/NNRTI-containing regimen with intermediate or high-level acquired drug resistance. The detection of one or more of these DRMs in an ART-naïve individual or in a individual with VF on a first-line NRTI/NNRTI-containing regimen may be considered an indication for a protease inhibitor (PI)-containing regimen or closer virological monitoring based on cost-effectiveness or country policy.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0145772;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0145772;;

Our study aims to provide insight into the expression and localization of key drug transporters and metabolic enzymes relevant to ART in this tissue compartment. Methods: We characterized gene and protein expression of 12 representative drug transporters and two metabolic enzymes in testicular tissue samples obtained from uninfected (n=8) and virally suppressed HIV-1-infected subjects on ART (n=5) and quantified antiretroviral drug concentrations in plasma and testicular tissues using LC/MS/MS from HIV-1-infected subjects. Results: Our data demonstrate that key ABC drug transporters (permeability glycoprotein, multidrug-resistance protein 1, 2 and 4, and breast cancer resistance protein), solute carrier transporters (organic anion transporting polypeptides 1B1 and 2B1, organic anion transporter 1, concentrative nucleoside transporter 1, equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2) and cytochrome P450 metabolic enzymes (CYP3A4 and CYP2D6) previously shown to interact with many commonly used antiretroviral drugs are expressed at the mRNA and protein level in the testes of both subject groups and localize primarily at the blood-testis barrier, with no significant differences between the two groups. Furthermore, we observed that PIs known to be substrates for ATP-binding cassette membrane transporters, displayed variable testicular tissue penetration, with darunavir concentrations falling below therapeutic values. In contrast, the NRTIs emtricitabine, lamivudine and tenofovir displayed favourable tissue penetration, reaching concentrations comparable to plasma levels. We also demonstrated that nuclear receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors  and  exhibited higher gene expression in the testicular tissue compared with pregnane X receptor and constitutive androstane receptor, suggesting a potential regulatory pathway governing drug transporter and metabolic enzyme expression in this tissue compartment. Conclusions: Our data suggest the testes are a complex pharmacological compartment that can restrict the distribution of certain antiretroviral drugs and potentially contribute to HIV-1 persistence.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dkw046;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

Effective antiviral treatments can prevent the progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular malignancy, and decrease liver-related morbidity and mortality.Areas covered: Paritaprevir-ritonavir-ombitasvir and dasabuvir (PrOD), with or without ribavirin, is an all-oral regimen approved for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infections, including patients with compensated cirrhosis. Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this regimen in HCV genotype 1-infected patients who are treatment-naïve and those who have failed peginterferon/ribavirin therapy. Additional studies evaluated the use of PrOD with or without ribavirin among special populations, including patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 and HCV, liver transplant recipients with HCV recurrence, and patients with severe renal impairment. Additionally, the combination of paritaprevir-ritonavir-ombitasvir plus ribavirin is found to be highly efficacious, and is now approved in the US, for the treatment of HCV genotype 4 infections.Expert opinion: The availability and use of interferon-free DAA combination regimens has resulted in a major paradigm shift in the treatment of HCV. PrOD, with or without ribavirin, is an effective, safe and tolerable treatment option.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1517/14656566.2015.1114099;5.7;5.6;4.9;14656566;;;

The ANRS 139 TRIO trial evaluated the combination of raltegravir, etravirine and darunavir, plus an optimized background therapy, in 87% of cases. Patients were highly experienced and harboured multiresistant viruses, but were naive to the three drugs, and showed a high level of virological suppression. Methods: Ultra-deep sequencing of reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase regions was performed at the trial baseline, and sequences were interpreted according to the ANRS algorithm. MRVs were assessed using MiSeq and 454 technologies (limit of detection 1%). Results: At baseline, minority variants with at least one NRTI, one NNRTI, one PI, one major PI or an integrase inhibitor resistance-associated mutation were present in 46%, 45%, 68%, 24% and 13% of patients, respectively. When minority variants are taken into account, the prevalence of resistance to etravirine, darunavir and raltegravir at baseline was 29%, 40% and 9%, respectively. No difference was observed in the prevalence of MRVs between patients with virological failure and those with virological success, except a trend for patients exhibiting baseline etravirine MRVs (50% versus 26%, P = 0.09). Conclusions: We have shown a high level of MRVs at baseline in highly pre-treated patients harbouring multiresistant viruses. However, these MRVs were not associated with an increased risk of virological failure, except for a trend for etravirine MRVs.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dkv048;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;dkv048;;

Methods: We prospectively followed two groups of HIV-infected pregnant women - with or without tuberculosis - recruited from prenatal clinics in South Africa. Women who received antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and reported being on therapy 12 months postpartum were included. Serum samples from women with HIV viremia 12 months postpartum were tested for drug resistance. Results: Of 103 women in the study, median age and CD4 T-cell count at enrollment were 29 years [interquartile range (IQR): 26-32] and 317 cells per cubic millimeter (IQR: 218-385), respectively; 43 (42%) had tuberculosis at baseline. During pregnancy, 87% of the women achieved an HIV RNA <400 copies per milliliter compared with 71% at 12 months postpartum (P < 0.001). Factors independently associated with an HIV RNA <400 copies per milliliter at 12 months were age 30 years, detectable plasma efavirenz concentration, and HIV RNA <400 copies per milliliter while pregnant; there was a trend toward both a detectable viral load and peripartum depression. HIV drug resistance results were available from 25 women, and 12 (48%) had major drug resistance mutations. CD4 T-cell count declined a median of 13 cells per cubic millimeter (IQR: -66 to 140) from delivery to 12 months in women with viremia at 12 months.

In our unit from 2006 to 2011, 1202 standard clinic and 69 research trial patients initiated cART; every eighth standard clinics patient was included to create a standard clinics:research trials patient ratio of 2:1. Notes were retrospectively reviewed for patient demographics, attendance rates and virological outcomes. Data from 221 antiretroviral-naïve patients starting cART were analysed: 152 standard clinic patients and 69 from research trials. In the research trials group, there was an overrepresentation of men (p = 0.041), men who have sex with men (p < 0.001), patients of white ethnicity (p = 0.01), employed patients (p = 0.01) and patients using excessive alcohol (p = 0.02). There was equal representation of drug use, depression and referral to psychology, psychiatry and social work in both groups.

We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate tuberculosis vaccine M72/AS01 in HIV-positive and HIV-negative Indian adults. Randomized, controlled observer-blind trial (NCT01262976). We assigned 240 adults (1:1:1) to antiretroviral therapy (ART)-stable, ART-naive, or HIV-negative cohorts. Cohorts were randomized 1:1 to receive M72/AS01 or placebo following a 0, 1-month schedule and followed for 12 months (time-point M13). HIV-specific and laboratory safety parameters, adverse events (AEs), and M72-specific T-cellmediated and humoral responses were evaluated. Subjects were predominantly QuantiFERON-negative (60%) and Bacille Calmette-Guerin-vaccinated (73%). Seventy ART-stable, 73 ART-naive, and 60 HIV-negative subjects completed year 1. No vaccine-related serious AEs or ART-regimen adjustments, or clinically relevant effects on laboratory parameters, HIV-1 viral loads or CD4 counts were recorded. Two ART-naive vaccinees died of vaccineunrelated diseases. M72/AS01 induced polyfunctional M72-specific CD4 T-cell responses (median [interquartile range] at 7 days postdose 2: ART-stable, 0.9% [0.7-1.5]; ART-naive, 0.5% [0.2-1.0]; and HIVnegative, 0.6% [0.4-1.1]), persisting at M13 (0.4% [0.2-0.5], 0.09% [0.04-0.2], and 0.1% [0.09-0.2], respectively).

We determined the mortality rate and risk factors for mortality among such children, at the pediatric HIV clinic of the Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH) in Jos, Nigeria. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study on 260 PTB-HIV-1 co-infected children, aged 2 months to 13 years, being treated for PTB and on ART from July 2005 to March 2013. The mortality rate and associated risk factors were determined using multivariate Cox proportional hazards modelling. Results The mortality rate for the study cohort was 1.4 per 100 child-years of follow-up. Median follow-up time was 5.2 years (IQR, 3.5-6.0 years) with total study time being 1159 child-years. The median age of those who died was lower than that of survivors, 1.9 years (IQR, 0.6-3.6 years) versus 3.8 years (IQR, 1.8-6.0 years), p=0.005). The majority of the deaths occurred in males (13, 81.2%), those <5 years of age (14, 87.4%) and those who had severe immunosuppression (11, 68.8%). Risk factors for death were age (with the risk of dying decreasing by 25% for every 1 year increase in age, adjusted hazard ratio (AHR)=0.75 [0.58-0.98], p=0.032), male gender (AHR=3.80 [1.07-13.5], p=0.039) and severe immunosuppression (AHR=3.35 [1.16-9.66], p=0.025). Conclusion In our clinic setting, mortality among our PTB-HIV co-infected children being treated for PTB and on ART was low. However, those presenting with severe immunosuppression and who are males and very young, should be monitored more closely during follow-up in order to further reduce mortality.;http://www.germs.ro/en/Articles/Mortality-among-pulmonary-tuberculosis-and-HIV-1-co-infected-Nigerian-children-being-treated-for-pulmonary-tuberculosis-and-on-antiretroviral-therapy-a-retrospective-cohort-study-549;1.2;1.8;2.0;;;;

Methods: In addition to phenotypes, viral genotypes were assessed by population and deep sequencing (PS and DS) in virological failures (VFs; baseline and end point) and responders (baseline). Minority resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) were defined as those with frequencies above 1% and not detected with PS. Results: By week 48, 41/101 (40.6%) patients experienced VF; 17/41 (41.5%) VFs and 22/54 (40.8%) responders had 1 baseline etravirine RAM by PS, mainly A98G, K101E, V106I and G190A. Baseline minority etravirine RAMs (n) were detected in 8/40 VFs (V90I [2], A98G [1], L100I [1], V106I [1], E138G [1] and Y181C [2]) and 5/38 responders (V90I [3], A98G [1], V106I [1] and E138G [1]). The most frequent emerging non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor RAMs detected by PS (3 VFs; n) were the etravirine RAMs Y181C (8), V90I (3), L100I (3) and E138A (3). In 15 of 29 (51.7%) VFs with baseline DS/PS and end point PS data, 1 emerging etravirine RAM was detected by PS, which was not detected at baseline by DS in most cases (12/15 [80.0%]). In 10/26 (38.5%) VFs with baseline/end point DS data, 1 additional emerging minority etravirine RAM was detected. Conclusions: Patterns of etravirine resistance in adults, adolescents and children experiencing VF are similar. The presence of minority etravirine RAMs at baseline was not consistently associated with treatment failure.

To clarify a clinical benefit to monitoring minority-level drug resistance populations as a guide to select active drugs for salvage therapy, we retrospectively analyzed the dynamics of low-frequency drug-resistant population in antiretroviral (ARV)-exposed drug resistant individuals. Materials and Methods Six HIV-infected individuals treated with ARV for more than five years were analyzed. These individuals had difficulty in controlling viremia, and treatment regimens were switchedmultiple times guided by standard drug resistance testing using bulk sequencing. To detect minority variant populations with drug resistance, we used a highly sensitive allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) with detection thresholds of 0.3â€""2%. According to ARV used in these individuals, we focused on the following seven reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant mutations:M41L, K65R, K70R, K103N, Y181C, M184V, and T215F/Y. Results of AS-PCR were compared with bulk sequencing data for concordance and presence of additionalmutations. To clarify the genetic relationship between low-frequency and high-frequency populations, AS-PCR amplicon sequences were compared with bulk sequences in phylogenetic analysis. Results The use of AS-PCR enabled detection of the drug-resistant mutations, M41L, K103N, Y181C, M184V and T215Y, present as low-frequency populations in five of the six individuals. These drug resistant variants persisted for several years without ARV pressure. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that pre-existing K103N and T215I variants had close genetic relationships with high-frequency K103N and T215I observed during treatment. Discussion and Conclusion Our results demonstrate the long-term persistence of drug-resistant viruses in the absence of drug pressure. The rapid virologic failures with pre-existing mutant viruses detectable by AS-PCR highlight the clinical importance of low-frequency drug-resistant viruses. Thus, our results highlight the usefulness of AS-PCR and support its expanded evaluation in ART clinical management.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0135941;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0135941;;

Methods: In this longitudinal observational study, we examined changes in interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon--inducible protein-10 (IP-10), monokine induced by interferon- (MIG) and soluble CD14 (sCD14) levels during 2 years of effective first-line cART. Biomarker levels before and after cART were compared with those observed in healthy subjects, using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Elevated biomarker levels were defined with respect to values for healthy subject (mean + 2 standard deviations). Factors associated with persistently elevated biomarker levels after 2 years of cART were identified by logistic regression. Results: We included in the study 139 patients with a median HIV-1 RNA level of 4.8 log10 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL and a median CD4 cell count of 294cells/L at cART initiation [day 0 (D0)]. At D0, all biomarker levels were higher than in healthy subjects (P<0.05). After 2 years of cART, IL-6, IP-10 and MIG levels fell significantly, by a median of 0.54, 420 and 1107pg/mL, respectively (all P<0.001), and were no longer elevated in >75% of patients. In contrast, sCD14 levels did not change significantly (0.18×106pg/mL; P=0.102) and remained elevated.

Given their potency, safety, and distinctive mechanism of action, INSTIs represent an important advance in HIV type 1 (HIV-1) therapy. Dolutegravir (DTG) is a new-generation INSTI recently approved for the treatment of HIV-1-infected adult patients, with distinct advantages compared with other available antiretroviral agents. In well-designed, large clinical trials, DTG-containing regimens have demonstrated either noninferiority or superiority to current first-line agents such as raltegravir-, darunavir/ritonavir-, and efavirenz-containing regimens. The favorable safety profile, low potential for drug interactions, minimal impact on lipids, good tolerability, and high resistance barrier of DTG makes this compound one of the preferred choices for HIV therapy in multiple clinical scenarios, including treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients. DTG is the only antiretroviral drug not yet associated with de novo emergence of resistance mutations in treatment-naïve individuals. However, data from in vitro studies and clinical trial suggest the possibility of cross-resistance between first- and second-generation INSTIs. Even though these profiles are infrequent at the moment, they need to be monitored in all current patients treated with INSTIs. With its potent activity, good tolerability, simplicity of dosing, and minimal drug interaction profile, DTG will likely play a major role in the management of patients with HIV-1 infection. On the basis of clinical trial data, current guidelines endorse DTG in combination with nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors as one of the recommended regimens in antiretroviral therapy-naïve patients. Most of the favorable clinical experiences from clinical trials are based on the combination of DTG with abacavir/lamivudine, and DTG is planned to be coformulated with abacavir/lamivudine. This will provide a further advantage, given that single tablet regimens are associated with higher adherence rates as well as improvement in quality of life and enhanced patient preference.;http://www.dovepress.com/combination-dolutegravirndashabacavirndashlamivudine-in-the-management-peer-reviewed-article-PPA;3.1;3.0;3.5;;;;

We used genome-wide genotyping and clinical data to explore genetic associations with virologic failure among patients randomized to efavirenz-containing or abacavir-containing regimens in AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) protocols. Participants and Methods: Virologic response and genome-wide genotype data were available from treatment-naive patients randomized to efavirenz-containing (n=1596) or abacavir-containing (n=786) regimens in ACTG protocols 384, A5142, A5095, and A5202. Results: Meta-analysis of association results across race/ethnic groups showed no genome-wide significant associations (P<5×10) with virologic response for either efavirenz or abacavir. Our sample size provided 80% power to detect a genotype relative risk of 1.8 for efavirenz and 2.4 for abacavir. Analyses focused on CYP2B genotypes that define the lowest plasma efavirenz exposure stratum did not show associations nor did analysis limited to gene sets predicted to be relevant to efavirenz and abacavir disposition. Conclusion: No single polymorphism is associated strongly with virologic failure with efavirenz-containing or abacavir-containing regimens. Analyses to better consider context, and that minimize confounding by nongenetic factors, may show associations not apparent here.;http://journals.lww.com/01213011-201502000-00001;4.5;5.0;5.6;17446872;;;

All rights reserved.AIM: Abacavir (ABC) is one of the more affordable antiretroviral drugs used for controlling HIV. Although with similar efficacy to current first-line drugs, its limited usage in Singapore can be attributed to its possible side effect of adverse hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs). HLA-B5701 genotyping is a clinically relevant procedure for avoiding abacavir-induced HSRs. As patients who do not carry the risk allele are unlikely to develop HSRs, a simple rule can be developed to allow abacavir prescription for patients who are B5701 negative. Here, we carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis of HLA-B5701 genotyping before abacavir prescription in the context of the Singapore healthcare system, which caters predominantly to Han Chinese, Southeast-asian Malays, and South-asian Indians. In addition, we aim to identify the most cost-effective treatment regimen for HIV patients. METHODS: A decision tree model was developed in TreeAge. The model considers medical treatment and genotyping costs, genotyping test characteristics, the prevalence of the risk allele, reduction in the quality of life, and increased expenditure due to side effects and other factors, evaluating independently over early-stage and late-stage HIV patients segmented by drug contraindications. Results: The study indicates that genotyping is not cost-effective for any ethnicity irrespective of the disease stage, except for Indian patients with early-stage HIV who are contraindicated to tenofovir. Conclusion: Abacavir (as first-line) without genotyping is the cheapest and most cost-effective treatment for all ethnicities except for early-stage Indian HIV patients contraindicated to tenofovir. The HLA-B5701 frequency, the mortality rate from abacavir-induced HSRs, and genotyping costs are among the major factors influencing the cost-effectiveness.;http://journals.lww.com/01213011-201502000-00002;4.5;5.0;5.6;17446872;;;

Inhibitors of particular coreceptors are being developed in order to exploit this step of cellular infection. However, effectiveness of these drugs requires matching of the administered therapeutic to coreceptor use by the viral variants infecting each patient. Patient viruses may use only CCR5 (R5), only CXCR4 (X4) or both (D/M). Most patients in early disease have R5 variants, with the presence of X4 variants increasing as disease progresses; the infecting subtype also affects the prevalence of X4 variants. Phenotypic, genotypic and clinical trial tests are in use to determine coreceptor utilization by HIV-1 variants, termed tropism, and to predict the response to entry inhibitors. Maraviroc is the only approved entry-coreceptor inhibitor and inhibits CCR5-gp120 interaction. Clinical trials of maraviroc in specific patient subgroups are elucidating the drugs role in contemporary clinical practice.

We assessed cabotegravir plus rilpivirine, as a two-drug oral antiretroviral regimen, for the maintenance of viral suppression in antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected individuals. Methods: In the phase 2b Long-Acting antireTroviral Treatment Enabling (LATTE) trial, a multicentre study done in Canada and the USA, antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected adults (aged 18 years) were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to oral cabotegravir 10 mg once a day, 30 mg once a day, 60 mg once a day, or oral efavirenz 600 mg once a day with dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for 24 weeks of induction. Patients who were virologically suppressed by week 24 received a two-drug maintenance regimen consisting of their randomly allocated cabotegravir dose plus oral rilpivirine 25 mg or continued efavirenz plus NRTIs for an additional 72 weeks. Patients and investigators were masked to doses of cabotegravir received for 96 weeks, but not to the assignment of cabotegravir or efavirenz. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with fewer than 50 copies per mL of HIV-1 RNA (US Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm) at week 48. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01641809. Findings: Of 243 patients randomly allocated and treated, 156 (86%) of 181 patients in the cabotegravir groups (52 [87%] of 60, 51 [85%] of 60, and 53 [87%] of 61 patients in the 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg groups, respectively) and 46 (74%) of 62 in the efavirenz group had fewer than 50 copies per mL of HIV-1 RNA after induction therapy. After patients in the cabotegravir groups were changed over from dual NRTIs to rilpivirine at week 24, 149 (82%; 95% CI 77-88) patients in the cabotegravir groups (48 [80%; 70-90], 48 [80%; 70-90], and 53 [87%; 78-95] patients in the 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg groups, respectively) versus 44 (71%; 60-82) in the efavirenz group were virologically suppressed at week 48, and 137 (76%; 69-82) receiving cabotegravir (41 [68%; 57-80], 45 [75%; 64-86], and 51 [84%; 74-93] patients in the 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg groups, respectively) versus 39 (63%; 51-75) in the efavirenz group were virologically suppressed at week 96. Treatment-related adverse events were reported by 93 (51%) cabotegravir-treated patients (28 [47%], 32 [53%], and 33 [54%] patients in the 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg groups, respectively) and 42 (68%) efavirenz-treated patients. Six (3%) patients in the cabotegravir groups (one [2%], one [2%], and four [7%] patients in the 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg groups, respectively) withdrew because of treatment-emergent adverse events compared with nine (15%) in the efavirenz group. Interpretation: Cabotegravir plus dual NRTI therapy had potent antiviral activity during the induction phase. As a two-drug maintenance therapy, cabotegravir plus rilpivirine provided antiviral activity similar to efavirenz plus dual NRTIs until the end of week 96. Combined efficacy and safety results lend support to our selection of oral cabotegravir 30 mg once a day for further assessment. LATTE precedes studies of the assessment of longacting injectable formulations of both drugs as a two-drug regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.

All Rights Reserved.Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is an investigational oral prodrug of the HIV-1 nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir (TFV). Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is another TFV prodrug, widely used for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. TAF is converted mostly intracellularly to TFV and, in comparison to TDF, achieves higher tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. As a result, TAF has demonstrated potent anti-HIV-1 activity at lower doses than TDF in monotherapy studies. Here, the in vitro virology profile of TAF was evaluated and compared to that of TDF. TAF displayed potent antiviral activity against all HIV-1 groups/subtypes, as well as HIV-2. TAF exhibited minimal changes in the drug concentration needed to inhibit 50% of viral spread (EC50) upon removal of the prodrug, similar to TDF, demonstrating intracellular antiviral persistence. While TAF and TDF exhibited comparable potencies in the absence of serum pretreatment, TAF maintained activity in the presence of human serum, whereas TDF activity was significantly reduced. This result demonstrates TAF's improved plasma stability over TDF, which is driven by the different metabolic pathways of the two prodrugs and is key to TAF's improved in vivo antiviral activity. The activity of TAF is specific for HIV, as TAF lacked activity against a large panel of human viruses, with the exception of herpes simplex virus 2, where weak TAF antiviral activity was observed, as previously observed with TFV. Finally, in vitro combination studies with antiretroviral drugs from different classes showed additive to synergistic interactions with TAF, consistent with ongoing clinical studies with TAF in fixed-dose combinations with multiple other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV.;https://aac.asm.org/content/59/10/5909;7.8;7.9;8.3;00664804;;;

The strength and grade of the recommendation vary depending on the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, the presence of opportunistic infections or comorbid conditions, age, and the efforts to prevent the transmission of HIV. The objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable plasma viral load (PVL). Initial ART should comprise three drugs, namely, two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and one drug from another family. Three of the recommended regimens, all of which have an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) as the third drug, are considered a preferred regimen; a further seven regimens, which are based on an INSTI, an non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or a protease inhibitor boosted with ritonavir (PI/r), are considered alternatives. The reasons and criteria for switching ART are presented both for patients with an undetectable PVL and for patients who experience virological failure, in which case the rescue regimen should include three (or at least two) drugs that are fully active against HIV. The specific criteria for ART in special situations (acute infection, HIV-2 infection, pregnancy) and comorbid conditions (tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections, kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer) are updated.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0213005X15001275;1.8;1.7;1.7;0213005X;;;

We enrolled 23 subjects who underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. Alveolar macrophages were isolated and HIV-1 RNA was quantified in the cells using the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 Assay. Proviral DNA was qualitatively measured using a modified version of the HIV-1 RNA assay. Phagocytosis measured by incubating alveolar macrophages with FITC-labeled Staphylococcus aureus and determining fluorescence with a Zeiss inverted microscope. Phagocytic index was calculated as (% positive cells×mean channel fluorescence)/100. Sixteen subjects had (+) proviral DNA and seven had (-) proviral DNA in their alveolar macrophages. Of all subjects 100% in both groups were on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The median plasma viral load was 0 in both groups. HIV-1-infected subjects with (+) proviral DNA in their alveolar macrophages had a significantly lower median alveolar macrophage phagocytic index compared to those with (-) proviral DNA in their alveolar macrophages [11.8 (IQR 4.8-39.0) vs. 64.9 (IQR 14.0-166.0), p=0.05]. Alveolar macrophages harbor HIV even in otherwise healthy subjects with undetectable plasma viral loads, representing a potential reservoir for the virus. In addition, HIV viral replication within the macrophage may impair phagocytosis and other immune functions in the lung, leading to an increased risk for lung infection.;http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2014.0133;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

Objectives: This study was designed to describe the proportions and quantities of NRTI and NNRTI-resistant variants in patients with successful first-line NNRTI therapy. Study design: We evaluated the presence of drug-resistance mutations (DRMs) prior to treatment initiation in 131 naive chronically HIV-1-infected patients initiating NNRTI-based first-line therapy. DRMs were detected by ultradeep pyrosequencing (UDPS) on a GS Junior instrument (Roche). Results: The mean HIV RNA concentration was 4.78±0.74logcopies/mL and the mean CD4 cell count was 368±184 CD4cells/mm3. Patients were mainly infected with subtype B (68%) and 96% were treated with efavirenz. The sensitivity threshold for each mutation was 0.13-1.05% for 2000 reads. Major NRTI-resistant or NNRTI-resistant mutations were detected in 40 patients (33.6%). The median frequency of major NRTI-resistant mutations was 1.37% [IQR: 0.39-84.1], i.e.: a median of 556copies/mL [IQR: 123-37,553]. The median frequency of major NNRTI-resistant DRMs was 0.78% [IQR: 0.67-7.06], i.e.: a median of 715copies/mL [IQR: 391-3452]. The genotypic susceptibility score (GSS) of 9 (7.3%) patients with mutations to given treatment detected by UDPS was 1.5 or 2. Conclusions: First-line NNRTI-based treatment can produce virological success in naïve HIV-1-infected patients harboring low-frequency DRMs representing <1% of the viral quasispecies. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical cut-off of low-frequency resistant variants associated to virological failure.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1386653214004077;5.7;6.0;5.9;13866532;;;

To determine the prevalence of such HIV drug resistance mutations (HIV DRM), we used an in-house sequencing assay in the pol gene (protease and partial reverse transcriptase) in a cohort of patients suspected of failing a first-line regimen, which in Zambia comprises two nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Our analysis cohort (n=68) was referred to the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka from November 2009 to October 2012. Median duration on first-line ART to suspected treatment failure was 3.2 years (IQR 1.7-4.7 years). The majority of patients (95%) harbored HIV-1 subtype C virus. Analysis of reverse transcriptase revealed M184V (88%), K103N/S (32%), and Y181C/I/V (41%) DRMs, with the latter conferring reduced susceptibility to the salvage therapy candidates etravirine and rilpivirine. Three patients (5%) had major protease inhibitor (PI) resistance mutations: all three had the V82A mutation, and one patient (Clade J virus) had a concurrent M46I, Q58E, and L76V DRM. HIV-1 genotyping revealed major and minor DRMs as well as high levels of polymorphisms in subtype C isolates from patients failing first-line antiretroviral therapy. Closer monitoring of DRM mutations at first-line failure can inform clinicians about future options for salvage therapy.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/jmv.24162;3.8;3.9;4.0;01466615;;;

There is no universally approved treatment for chronic hepatitis D (CHD) in HIV-infected patients. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) containing tenofovir has been recently associated with HDV suppression. Our aim was to evaluate whether the outcome of CHD in HIV-infected patients can be favourably influenced by ART including reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Methods: The clinical course of four HBV/HDV/HIV-coinfected patients receiving ART were retrospectively examined. Results: HDV RNA became undetectable in all patients after a variable period of ART along with the disappearance of hepatitis B surface antigen in two of them, and an increase in CD4+ T-cell count. In all patients, virological changes were associated with improved liver function tests and clinical features. Conclusions: We suggest that ART regimens including drugs active against HBV could have beneficial effects on the clinical course of CHD in patients with HIV-1 by favouring immunological reconstitution.;http://www.intmedpress.com/journals/avt/abstract.cfm?id=2911&pid=48;4.4;4.1;3.9;13596535;;;

With modern HIV therapeutics, HIV-cHL treatment outcomes are largely comparable to those of the background population with cHL (non-HIV-cHL). To achieve these outcomes, particular attention must be given to managing HIV. This management includes understanding HIV as a comorbid condition with a spectrum of impact that is unique to each patient. Meticulous attention to drug-drug interactions is required to avoid toxicity and pharmacokinetic effects that can undermine cure. Relapsed and refractory HIV-cHL poses additional therapeutic challenges. The standard management in this setting should also be based on that for non-HIV-cHL, and includes the use of salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant in chemo sensitive disease. The role of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant is less clear but may be useful in select cases. Newer agents with activity in cHL are being tested as part of primary and salvage therapy and are also highly relevant for HIV-cHL.;https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/125/8/1226/34168/How-I-treat-classical-Hodgkin-lymphoma-in-patients;18.1;18.0;18.6;00064971;;;

Patients treated in high/highmiddle income countries (odds ratio 4.4 versus low/lowmiddle, 95% CI 2.6, 7.4; P<0.001) and those with elevated baseline alanine transaminase (odds ratio 4.2 versus normal, 95% CI 2.4, 7.2; P<0.001) were more likely to receive tenofovir. Hepatitis C antibody positive patients (odds ratio 0.4 versus negative, 95% CI 0.2, 0.8; P=0.008) were less likely. In those starting antiretroviral therapy with elevated alanine transaminase, mean reduction after tenofovir initiation was 11.2 IU/l (95% CI 0.9, 21.6; P=0.034) lower compared with those using a non-tenofovir-based regimen although this did not signiicantly increase the chance of alanine transaminase normalization. Tenofovir use was not associated with a superior CD4+ T-cell response. Conclusions: HBV-HIV-coinfected patients in Asia are most likely to receive tenofovir if they are treated in a high/highmiddle income country, have elevated alanine transaminase levels and are hepatitis C antibody negative. Compared to other antiretroviral therapies, tenofovir-based regimens more effectively reduce liver inlammation in HBV-HIV-coinfection but do not result in superior CD4+ T-cell recovery.";http://www.intmedpress.com/journals/avt/abstract.cfm?id=2972&pid=48;4.4;4.1;3.9;13596535;;;

Thus, we studied the feasibility of continued antiretroviral therapy in our HIV-infected patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic transplantation. All HIV-infected adults undergoing HCT for hematologic malignancy at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center between 2006 and 2014 were included; most were enrolled in a prospective clinical study to monitor HIV reservoirs after transplantation (. NCT00968630 and NCT00112593). Non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor or integrase-strand inhibitor-anchored antiretroviral therapy regimens were continued or selected before HCT by infectious disease physicians. Plasma HIV RNA was measured every other day for the first 2 weeks after transplantation and then every 2 weeks. Missed doses of cART and reasons for changing the cART regimen during the post-transplantation hospitalization were documented through review of inpatient pharmacy records. Seven autologous and 8 allogeneic transplantations were performed. In 9 transplantations, the cART regimen was not altered after HCT and no doses were missed. In 2 patients who required alterations in their cART regimen because of development of acute renal failure (n = 1) and small bowel obstruction (n = 1) after HCT, enfuvirtide was used as a bridging component of the regimen. Plasma HIV RNA remained suppressed during the first 28 days in 12 of 15 transplantations, and no patients had a plasma HIV RNA >1000 copies/mL during long-term follow up. Non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor- and integrase-strand inhibitor-based cART are safe and effective in HIV-infected persons during the peri-HCT period. Most patients undergoing HCT were able to continue cART without missed doses. Sustained HIV viremia and emergence of resistance were not detected.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1083879115005352;7.6;7.0;6.6;10838791;;;

Darunavir, a HIV protease inhibitor, co-administered with low-dose ritonavir (800/100 mg once daily), is recommended in guidelines in combination with other antiretrovirals for HIV patients with no darunavir resistance-associated mutations. Cobicistat is an alternative agent to ritonavir for boosting plasma drug levels of darunavir among other antiretrovirals. Cobicistat is a more specific cytochrome P450 3A inhibitor than ritonavir without enzyme-inducing properties. This review describes the differing effects of cobicistat and ritonavir on metabolic enzymes, which explains their differing drug-drug interactions, and summarizes some of the studied drug-drug interactions for cobicistat. It also outlines the clinical development and data for a once-daily darunavir/cobicistat FDC. This FDC thus allows for a once-daily treatment regimen (including background antiretrovirals) with reduced pill burden.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1586/14787210.2015.1033400;5.7;5.6;5.4;14787210;;;

Rifampicin (RIF) induces UGT1A1, an enzyme involved in raltegravir (RAL) elimination, thereby potentially lowering RAL exposure. We examined the pharmacokinetics of RAL in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on RIF-based antitubercular therapy in the French National Agency for HIV/AIDS and Viral Hepatitis Research 12 180 Reflate Tuberculosis trial. Methods. Patients started RAL in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and lamivudine after initiation of RIF (10 mg/kg/day). In arm 1 (n = 21), they received 400 mg RAL twice daily; in arm 2 (n = 16), they received RAL 800 mg twice daily initially then 400 mg twice daily 4 weeks after RIF discontinuation. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed over 12-hour periods, 4 weeks after initiation of RAL together with RIF (period 1), 4 weeks after RIF discontinuation (period 2), and after the RAL dose reduction in arm 2 (period 3). Results. In arm 1, the geometric mean ratio (GMR) between period 1 and period 2 was 0.94 (90% confidence interval [CI],. 64-1.37) for the 12-hour area under the time-concentration curve (AUC0-12), and 0.69 (90% CI,. 42-1.13) for the concentration at 12 hours (C12). In arm 2, the corresponding GMRs were 0.75 (90% CI,. 48-1.17) and 1.10 (90% CI,. 61-2.00) for period 1 vs period 2, and 1.10 (90% CI,. 78-1.55) and 1.68 (90% CI,. 88-3.23) for period 1 vs period 3. Conclusions. The double dose of RAL overcompensated for RIF induction, but the standard dose was associated with only small decreases in AUC0-12 and C12 during RIF coadministration, warranting further evaluation in patients with HIV/tuberculosis coinfection.

The genetic diversity of HIV-1 found in these patients was also determined using phylogenetic analysis. The protease-reverse transcriptase (Pro-RT) region of the genome was amplified from 40 samples, sequenced, and analyzed for the identification of antiretroviral resistance-associated mutations (RAMs). All isolates belonged to subtype B and 39 possessed multiple RAMs in the reverse transcriptase genes that would compromise the efficacy of drugs being used to treat these patients. Four isolates possessed RAMs in the protease genes. The overall frequency of HIV drug resistance was 95%. The high frequency of drug resistance is supported by epidemiological data that revealed an equally high frequency of treatment failure (98%) among the study participants. The results of this study indicate the urgent need for greater access to drug resistance testing in Jamaica.;http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2015.0122;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

It is unclear how this difference in short-term efficacy impacts long-term cost-effectiveness of these regimens. This study sought to evaluate long-term cost-effectiveness of DTG + ABC/3TC vs EFV/TDF/FTC from a US payer perspective.Methods:This study is an individual discrete-event simulation which tracked the disease status and treatment pathway of HIV-1 patients. The model simulated treatment over a lifetime horizon by tracking change in patients CD4 count, clinical events occurrence (opportunistic infections, cancer, and cardiovascular events), treatment switch, and death. The model included up to four lines of treatment. Baseline patient characteristics, efficacy, and safety of DTG + ABC/3TC and EFV/TDF/FTC were informed by data from the SINGLE trial. The efficacy of subsequent treatment lines, clinical event risks, mortality, cost, and utility inputs were based on literature and expert opinion. Outcomes were lifetime discounted medical costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).Results:Compared with EFV/TDF/FTC, DTG + ABC/3TC increased lifetime costs by $19,153 and per person survival by 0.12 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $158,890/QALY. ICERs comparing DTG + ABC/3TC to EFV/TDF/FTC remained above the traditional, US willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained in all scenarios, and above $100,000 or $150,000/QALY gained in most scenarios.Limitations:Due to data limitations, the treatment patterns, CD4 count during viral rebound and treatment switch, viral rebound after trial end, and long-term adverse event-related treatment discontinuation were based on assumptions, presented to and approved by clinical experts.Conclusions:Compared with EFV/TDF/FTC, DTG + ABC/3TC resulted in higher cost and only slightly increased QALYs over a lifetime, with an ICER that exceeded the standard cost-effectiveness threshold. This indicates that the incremental benefit in effectiveness associated with DTG + ABC/3TC may not be worth the incremental increase in costs.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3111/13696998.2015.1046878;3.5;3.3;3.3;13696998;;;

In several Phase I pharmacokinetic studies, one Dutrebis (150 mg lamivudine/300 mg raltegravir) fixed-dose combination tablet showed a higher bioavailability but comparable lamivudine and 400 mg raltegravir poloxamer exposures. Thus, the co-administration of raltegravir together with lamivudine created a potent, effective, well-tolerated antiretroviral combination, which could be more convenient for the patient.

Safety was assessed by recording of adverse events, laboratory data, vital signs, clinical and physical examination. A total of 200 subjects were enrolled, 100 subjects in each treatment group. The statistically significant (<0.001) increase in CD4 cells count was reported with mean increase from 222.71 cells/mm3 to 352.69 cell/mm3 and 212.39 cells/mm3 to 339.42 cell/mm3, respectively in treatment group 1 and 2. The statistically significant (<0.001) increase in CD8 cells count was reported with median increase of 294 cells/mm3 and 251 cell/mm3, respectively in group 1 and 2. The change in CD4 cells count and CD8 cells count from baseline was not statistical significant (p=0.81 and p=0.17, respectively) between the two treatment groups.

We measured the extent and consequences of off-label antiretroviral (ARV) use in an HIV-infected paediatric cohort. Methods: In this multicentre cohort study involving 318 HIV-infected children and adolescents from the Madrid Cohort, all off-label prescriptions from March 1988 to March 2012 were recorded from the clinical records. The reasons for prescribing ARV off-label, the side effects and the consequences of incorrect dosing of ARVs are discussed. Results: Among the 318 patients of the cohort, 221 (69%) received off-label ARVs according to EMA licensing at the time of prescription, representing 23% (540) of the 2,353 prescribed ARVs. The main reason for starting an off-label drug was treatment failure. Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 12% of the prescriptions. Problems taking the drug led to withdrawal in 5%, more likely when formulation was not suitable for age (P<0.05). Up to 10% were overdosed and 10% underdosed, deined as 25% above or below the current recommended dose, respectively. Treatment failure occurred signiicantly more frequently among underdosed compared to overdosed patients (50% versus 26%; P<0.05). Conclusions: Off-label use of ARVs was common in our HIV-1 paediatric patients. Adverse events were common but rarely led to withdrawal. Suitable formulation is important in younger children. Pharmacokinetic studies are needed as frequent incorrect dosing may occur when prescribing off-label and underdosing may lead to treatment failure.";None;4.4;4.1;3.9;13596535;;;

We assessed CD4 cell counts (as a marker of treatment failure), determined the rate of switching to second-line treatment and evaluated mortality related to treatment failure among HIV-infected patients in Guinea-Bissau. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, adult patients infected with HIV-1 receiving 6 months of ART at an HIV clinic in Bissau were included from June 2005 to July 2014 and followed until January 2015. Treatment failure was defined as 1) a fall in CD4 count to baseline (or below) or 2) CD4 levels persistently below 100 cells/L after 6 months of ART. Cox hazard models, with time since six months of ART as the time-varying coefficient, were used to estimate the hazard ratio for death and loss to follow-up. Results: We assessed 1,591 HIV-1-infected patients for immunological treatment failure. Treatment failure could not be determined in 594 patients (37.3%) because of missing CD4 cell counts. Among the remaining 997 patients, 393 (39.4%) experienced failure. Only 39 patients (9.9%) with failure were switched from first- to second-line ART. The overall switching rate was 3.1 per 100 person-years. Mortality rate was higher in patients with than without treatment failure, with adjusted hazard rate ratios (HRRs) 10.0 (95% CI: 0.9-107.8), 7.6 (95% CI: 1.6-35.5) and 3.1 (95% CI: 1.5-6.3) in the first, second and following years, respectively. During the first year of follow-up, patients experiencing treatment failure had a higher risk of being lost to follow-up than patients not experiencing treatment failure (adjusted HRR 4.4; 95% CI: 1.7-11.8). Conclusions: We found a high rate of treatment failure, an alarmingly high number of patients for whom treatment failure could not be assessed, and a low rate of switching to a second-line therapy.

Methods: This was a prospective, single-arm pilot study. HIV-1-infected patients with plasma viral suppression and HIV-associated NCI on a regimen including TDF/FTC/EFV were switched to abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC)/maraviroc (MVC). The Global Deficit Score (GDS) was used to score cognitive function at baseline and 48 weeks after treatment switch. Both CSF and blood samples were taken at baseline and between weeks 24 and 36 after switching. HIV-1 RNA in plasma and CSF was determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Inflammatory biomarkers in CSF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: A total of 71 patients receiving TDF/FTC/EFV were screened. Twelve of them (17%) had documented NCI, lacked the human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B*57:01 haplotype and harboured Chemokine Receptor Type-5 (CCR5)-tropic virus. Eight patients had detectable HIV-1 RNA (between 2.7 and 41.6 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) in CSF at baseline. All participants had elevated levels of neopterin and Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein 1 (MCP-1) in CSF at baseline. Eight out of 12 patients completed their follow-up assessment after treatment switch. The GDS decreased from 0.55 to 0.4 (P=0.085). Median HIV-1 RNA in CSF decreased from 3.49 to 2.20 (P=0.23). Among the inflammation markers in CSF, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- decreased significantly from median 0.51 to 0.35pg/mL (P=0.027), showing a correlation with the changes in neopterin, interferon (IFN)- and interleukin (IL)-6. Conclusions: Most patients with NCI receiving TDF/FTC/EFV had low-level viraemia and/or increased inflammatory markers in CSF. Treatment switching to an MVC-containing regimen with better CNS penetration resulted in a trend towards improvement in neurocognitive status and reduced TNF- concentrations in CSF.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/hiv.12243;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;

In this study, we examined the impact of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) on the expression of HIV-1 restriction miRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-1-infected men who have sex with men (MSM). Compared with male healthy donors, HIV-infected MSM had significantly lower levels of 9 HIV-1 restriction miRNAs. The treatment of HIV-1-infected MSM with cART, however, failed to restore the levels of these miRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These observations suggest that the suppression of the cellular restriction miRNAs by HIV-1 may attribute to the virus latency during cART.

INTRODUCTION MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in host cell innate immunity and HIV-1 infection. A number of cellular miRNAs can modulate HIV-1 replication through directly or indirectly targeting HIV-1 RNA or mRNAs that encode HIV-related host cell factors.1 Research from different laboratories have shown that miR-28, miR-125b, miR-150, miR-198, miR-223, miR-382, miR-29a ,2 miR-29b,1 and miR-29c3 have the ability to inhibit HIV-1 replication in CD4 T cells and macrophages by several mechanisms.1 The miRNAs can suppress HIV expression by directly targeting 3'-UTR (miR-28, miR-125b, miR-150, miR-223, and miR-382)1,4 or nef (miR-29a/b/c)1,5,6 of the HIV genome, or by indirectly targeting the mRNA of Cyclin T1 that stimulates HIV-1 production in the infected cells (miR-198, miR-150, miR-223, and miR-29b).1,7,8 Conversely, HIV-1 infection can alter the miRNA expression profiles in the circulating blood cells from the infected individuals.1,6,9,10 Given the importance of the cellular restriction miRNAs in the host cell innate immunity against HIV-1 infection, it is of great interest to determine whether HIV-1 infection inhibits the expression of these cellular miRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). More importantly, it is clinically significant to determine whether combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can restore HIV-1-mediated suppression of cellular viral restriction miRNAs.;http://journals.lww.com/00005792-201511170-00033;2.1;2.7;2.7;00257974;;;

All Rights Reserved.Plasma viral load and CD4 counts are effective for clinical monitoring, but they do not give a full representation of HIV-1 quasispecies in cellular reservoirs, the major repository of replication-competent HIV-1 in infected individuals. We sought to develop a diagnostic system that might stimulate the replication-competent HIV-1 reservoirs for enhanced clinical monitoring, including selection of antiretroviral regimens. Whole-blood samples from 45 HIV-infected individuals were collected into 1 ViraStim HIV-1 activation tube and 1 EDTA tube. Samples were tested for viral load and cell type-specific HIV-1 replication. Further, 7 matched activated/nonactivated samples were sequenced using the Trugene HIV-1 genotyping kit. The percentage of patients with replication-competent virus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) varied, depending on the baseline plasma viral load in the EDTA tubes. Six out of 24 patients with a starting plasma viral load of <20 copies/ml (cp/ml), 6 out of 8 patients with starting viral loads of >20 and <1,000 cp/ml, and 8 out of 13 patients with starting viral loads of >1,000 all showed increases in viral replication of >5-fold. These increases came from cellular reservoirs in blood as determined by simultaneous ultrasensitive subpopulation staining/hybridization in situ (SUSHI). When resistance genotypes in plasma from activation tubes were compared to those from EDTA tubes for 7 patients, all patients showed additional mutations in the activation tube, while 3 patients demonstrated additional genotypic resistance determinants. We show that HIV-1 viral replication can be stimulated directly from infected whole blood. The sequencing results showed that 3 of 7 cases demonstrated additional drug resistance following stimulation.;https://jcm.asm.org/content/53/1/60;8.0;8.2;8.6;00951137;;;

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. HIV-1-infected adults on first-line ART for at least 1 year attending routine visits in the Manhiça District Hospital, in a semi-rural area in southern Mozambique with no HIV-1 RNA monitoring available, were evaluated for clinical, socio-demographic, therapeutic, immunological and virological characteristics. Factors associated with HIV-1 RNA 1000 copies/mL and HIV drug resistance were determined using multivariate logistic regression. Results: The study included 334 adults on first-line ART for a median of 3 years, of which 65% (214/332) had suppressed viraemia, 11% (37/332) had low-level viraemia (HIV-1 RNA 150-999 copies/mL) and 24% (81/332) had overt virological failure (HIV-1 RNA  1000 copies/mL). HIV drug resistance was detected in 89% of subjects with virological failure, but in none with low-level viraemia. Younger age [OR=0.97 per additional year (95% CI=0.94-1.00), P=0.039], ART initiation at WHO stage III/IV [OR=2.10 (95% CI=1.23-3.57), P=0.003] and low ART adherence [OR=2.69 (95% CI=1.39-5.19), P=0.003] were associated with virological failure. Longer time on ART [OR=1.55 per additional year (95% CI=1.00-2.43), P=0.052] and illiteracy [OR=0.24 (95% CI=0.07-0.89), P=0.033] were associated with HIV drug resistance. Compared with HIV-1 RNA, clinician's judgement of ART failure, based on clinical and immunological outcomes, only achieved 29% sensitivity and misdiagnosed 1 out of every 4.5 subjects. Conclusions: Public health programmes in Mozambique should focus on early HIV diagnosis, early ART initiation and adherence support. Virological monitoring drastically improves the diagnosis of ART failure, enabling a better use of resources.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dkv143;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

All rights reserved.Purpose of review We aim to review the strengths and weaknesses of current antiretroviral therapy (ART), and describe ongoing research to address limitations to current therapy. Recent findings Current ART is highly effective and well tolerated. As a result of a decrease in medication side-effects and pill burden, and the known health effects of uncontrolled viremia, ART is now recommended at all CD4 cell counts in the USA. Novel medications are being developed to further decrease side-effects and offer alternative options for patients with multiclass resistance. New combination pills will further decrease pill burden. Summary Current treatment for HIV is characterized by highly potent oral antiretroviral medications, which are well tolerated, resulting in outstanding rates of virologic suppression in patients who are adherent to therapy. Despite the marked improvement in therapeutic options, limitations to therapy still exist including reliance on daily adherence, long-term toxicity of medications, drug-drug interactions, long-term effects of HIV even in the setting of viral suppression, high lifetime cost of treatment, and limited options for some patients with multiclass resistance. Emerging alternative treatment strategies include nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-sparing or limiting regimens and long-acting injectable combination therapy.;http://journals.lww.com/01222929-201507000-00004;7.5;7.2;7.8;1746630X;;;

All rights reserved.Initial treatment with dolutegravir offers higher efficacy than treatment with efavirenz, darunavir/ritonavir and even with raltegravir in patients with a high viral load. Like ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, dolutegravir will probably have a high genetic barrier to resistance and prior genetic testing will not be required in integrase inhibitor-naïve patients. The drug is well tolerated and associated with few treatment discontinuations. It can be administered once daily and the tablet size is small. A fixed-dose combination tablet containing dolutegravir, abacavir and lamivudine will soon be available. Dolutegravir has few interactions with commonly-used drugs. It does not require pharmacological boosting and has no food or time of day restrictions. Because of these characteristics, dolutegravir has a unique profile and is the ideal drug for most HIV-infected patients.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0213005X15300070;1.8;1.7;1.7;0213005X;;;

Method: Data on 6309 patients initiated on first-line ART between January 2004 and December 2006 were analyzed retrospectively. Factors predictive of modification to initial ART were assessed by chi-square and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: Overall, 5212 (83%) included patients incurred a modification (73.3% drug substitution and 9.7% drug switch) to their initial first-line ARV regimen during a median (interquartile range) follow-up period of 7 (3-8) years. Drug substitutions of zidovudine (ZDV) were less likely than of tenofovir (TDF; adjusted odd ratio [AOR] 0.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51-0.71), and Drug substitutions of efavirenz (EFV) were more likely than of nevirapine (NVP)- containing (AOR 1.82; 95% CI: 1.42-2.33) regimens.

This increase has potentially transformed HIV-infection from a fatal to a chronic disease: a transformation only possible if the prescribed medications are taken accordingly. We therefore evaluated optimal adherence to cART by three commonly used methods: visual analogue scale (VAS), four days recall (FDR) and clinic attendance (CA) for the last six months in 301 HIV-infected patients on cART for at least six months at the Douala General Hospital, Cameroon. Optimal adherence was defined to be greater than or equal to the 95th percentile estimate of each method. We found that 70.8% of our study population was female. The mean age was 40.8 years (SD 10.5) and 85% were on first line cART. Median CD4 count was 397 cells/ml (252–559). Optimal adherence by VAS, FDR and CA, was 68.1%, 83.4%, and 73.4%, respectively. VAS and FDR inter-correlated strongly (Pearson’s Chi square coefficient, r = 0.58, p < 0.001). Higher CD4 count above 200 cells/ml was associated with optimal adherence by CA (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]:2.6 (95% CI: 1.2–5.3, p < 0.001)). As high optimal adherence to cART is associated with good clinical outcome in HIV patients, simple methods such as the VAS for evaluating adherence, should be integrated to the HIV clinic of the Douala General Hospital.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956462415627394;2.5;2.5;2.7;09564624;;;

In this study, an amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR assay was developed and used to investigate the most frequent HIVDR mutations affecting first-line ART in settings whereWHOART guidelines are applied. Seventy-five HIV-positive (HIV=) samples from Cameroon were used to assess the performance of this assay. Sequencing of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was simultaneously performed for comparison, and discordant samples were tested with a Trugene HIV-1 genotyping kit. The ARMS-PCR assay was able to detect M184V, T215Y/F, K103N, and Y181C mutations with sensitivities of 96.8%, 85.7%, 91.3%, and 70%, respectively, and specificities of 90.6%, 95%, 100%, 96.9%, respectively, compared with data on sequencing. The results indicated the highest positive predictive value for K103N (100%) and the highest negative predictive value for M184V (97.5%). ARMS-PCR's limits of detection for mutations M184V, T215Y/F, K103N, and Y181C were<75 copies/ml, 143 copies/ ml, 143 copies/ml, and 836 copies/ml, respectively. ARMS-PCR efficiently identified mutations in individuals harboring different HIV-1 clades (CRF02-AG and non-CRF02-AG). In addition, this approach was more cost-effective than other genotyping assays. The high throughput, the cost-effectiveness, and the simplicity of the ARMS-PCR assay make it a suitable tool to monitor HIVDR patterns in resource-constrained settings with broad HIV-1 genetic diversity.;https://jcm.asm.org/content/53/5/1662;8.0;8.2;8.6;00951137;;;

They inhibit the catalytic activity of the HIV-encoded enzyme integrase and prevent the integration of the HIV genome into the host cell genome, so slowing the propagation of the infection. Integrase strand transfer inhibitors cause a rapid drop in viral load, exhibit very low drug interactions (except elvitegravir/cobicistat), and have low pill burden and convenient dosing frequency. Drugs in this class have been compared to others in antiretroviral-naive patients with efavirenz and with protease inhibitors. Final results of the STARTMRK trial highlighted the better virologic and immunologic performance of raltegravir over efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil co-formulation. Raltegravir was also superior to atazanavir/ritonavir and darunavir/ritonavir in the ACTG 5257 study for the combined virologic/tolerability endpoint. Elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir was non-inferior to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir and to atazanavir/ritonavir plus emtricitabine/tenofovir in terms of confirmed virologic response in the GS-US-236-0102 and GS-US-236-0103 studies, respectively. Finally, dolutegravir showed non-inferiority compared to raltegravir in the SPRING-2 study and was superior to efavirenz and darunavir/ritonavir in the SINGLE and FLAMINGO trials, respectively. The aim of this review is to analyze the data on efficacy and safety of integrase strand transfer inhibitors in antiretroviral-naive HIV patients and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of drugs within this class.;None;4.0;3.4;3.1;11396121;;;

Methods: The study consisted of an initial 4-week screening period, 48 weeks of treatment and a 4-week follow-up period. Patients initially received darunavir/ritonavir 20/3 mg/kg twice-daily for 2 weeks. Following review of pharmacokinetic, safety and antiviral data, the doses of darunavir/ritonavir were adjusted to 25/3 mg/kg twice-daily for patients <15 kg, and 375/50 mg twice-daily for patients 15 to <20 kg. Results: Of the 34 patients screened, 21 were treated (median treatment duration 48.6 weeks). Darunavir plus an OBR was well tolerated over 48 weeks, with no new safety concerns, and a comparable safety profile to that seen in older children and adults. All treatment-emergent lipid-related and glucose-related laboratory abnormalities were grade 1 or 2. At week 48, 17 of 21 patients (81.0%) had a confirmed virologic response (intent-to-treat, time-to-loss of virologic response). Improvements in height and weight were seen during the study. Conclusions: No new safety concerns were observed over a 48 week period. These results led to lowering the age to 3 years at which darunavir/ritonavir is indicated for use in treatment-experienced pediatric patients. This study also established doses of darunavir to use in treatment-experienced, HIV-1-infected patients aged 3 to <6 years. A high virologic response was observed with this dose. No development of resistance was observed in patients who experienced virologic failure.;http://journals.lww.com/00006454-201505000-00014;4.7;4.4;3.9;08913668;;;

All rights reserved.Background: Use of several antiretrovirals (ARVs) has been shown to be associated with a higher risk of diabetes in HIV-infected adults. We estimated the incidence of new-onset diabetes and assessed the association between individual ARVs and ARV combinations, and diabetes in a large cohort in Thailand. Methods: We selected all HIV-1-infected, nondiabetic, antiretroviral-naive adults enrolled in the Program for HIV Prevention and Treatment cohort (NCT00433030) between January 2000 and December 2011. Diabetes was defined as confirmed fasting plasma glucose 126 mg/dL or random plasma glucose 200 mg/dL. Incidence was the number of cases divided by the total number of person-years of follow-up. Association between ARVs and ARV combinations, and new-onset diabetes was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Overall, 1594 HIV-infected patients (76% female) were included. Median age at antiretroviral therapy initiation was 32.5 years. The incidence rate of diabetes was 5.0 per 1000 person-years of followup (95% confidence interval: 3.8 to 6.6) (53 cases). In analyses adjusted for potential confounders, exposure to stavudine + didanosine [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 3.9; P = 0.001] and cumulative exposure 1 year to zidovudine (aHR = 2.3 vs. no exposure; P = 0.009) were associated with a higher risk of diabetes. Conversely, cumulative exposure1 year to tenofovir (aHR = 0.4 vs. no exposure; P = 0.02) and emtricitabine (aHR = 0.4 vs. no exposure; P = 0.03) were associated with a lower risk. Conclusions: The incidence of diabetes in this predominantly female, young, lean population was relatively low. Although stavudine and didanosine have now been phased out in most antiretroviral therapy programs, our analysis suggests a higher risk of diabetes with zidovudine, frequently prescribed today in resource-limited settings.";http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201508010-00009;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

Dolutegravir is a second-generation INI that can overcome many prior raltegravir and elvitegravir failures. Here, we report the evolution of resistance to dolutegravir in a highly treatment-experienced patient harbouring the major N155H mutation consequent to raltegravir treatment failure. Methods: Genotypic and phenotypic analyses were done on longitudinal samples to determine viral resistance to INIs. Integrase amino acid sequence interactions with raltegravir and dolutegravir were assessed by molecular modelling and docking simulations. Results: Five mutations (A49P, L68FL, T97A, E138K and L234V) were implicated in emergent dolutegravir resistance, with a concomitant severe compromise in viral replicative capacity. Molecular modelling and docking simulations revealed that dolutegravir binding to integrase was affected by these acquired dolutegravir mutations. Conclusions: Our findings identify a novel mutational pathway involving integrase mutations A49P and L234V, leading to dolutegravir resistance in a patient with the N155H raltegravir mutation.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dku387;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

As the HIV accumulates the key mutations, the drug resistance occurs, that pose challenges to the ART regimens currently being used. Thus, the present study was carried out among the ART- naive patients attending ART Centre at Salem district, Tamil Nadu, India. The mutations that concern the drug resistance were discriminated by determining the viral load before and after 6 months. The drug resistance was analyzed by HIV genotyping from the patients possessing a viral load of >1000 copies/mL after 6 months of ART. The mutations pertaining to drug resistance were analyzed by the online Stanford HIV Database. The 3D structures of the RT were modeled and the drugs used in the first-line regimens were docked to explore the effect of mutations on the binding pattern of the drugs. Among the 250 patients, the viral load data were obtained for 213 patients. The study found 23 patients with both virological and immunological failures and HIV drug mutations were also revealed by genotyping. The mutations of I135R/T/V/X, L178 I/M, M184V/I, D67N, K70R, and K103N were the most common among these 23 patients. The present study revealed that the NACO recommended first-line ART regimen is efficient in most of the patients attending ART center. The emergence of drug resistance of HIV variant is common even under the best circumstance of ART. This study reveals that there is a necessity for the implementation of improved and economically systematic attempt that allows the clinicians to make a rational choice of therapy regimen to overcome the first- line therapy failures among the ART- naive.;http://www.eurekaselect.com/openurl/content.php?genre=article&issn=1570-162X&volume=13&issue=2&spage=160;2.7;2.4;2.3;1570162X;;;

We investigated whether levels of MT markers are influenced by the use of co-trimoxazole (TMP-SMX) in HIV-1 patients. Plasma samples were obtained from HIV-1-infected patients initiating ART with (n=13) or without (n=13) TMP-SMX prophylaxis. Markers of MT [lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), soluble CD14 (sCD14), and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP)] were assessed at baseline (BL), at 1 month, and at 1 year by the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Assay or ELISA. BL levels of LBP were elevated in both categories of patients; they were highest in patients starting ART and TMP-SMX (median, g/ml: 36.7 vs. 4.3, respectively, p=0.001) and correlated inversely with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts (=-0.65; p=0.005). Patients receiving ART and TMP-SMX had a significant reduction in LBP between BL and 1 year (median, g/ml: 36.7 vs. 11.1; p=0.003). In contrast, levels of LPS at BL were lower in patients starting ART and TMP-SMX compared to those without TMP-SMX (median, pg/ml: 221 vs. 303 respectively; p=0.002) and did not change at 1 year. The increased BL levels of sCD14 had declined in both groups at 1 year. No difference in I-FABP levels was found between BL and 1 year. Concomitant use of ART and TMP-SMX reduces microbial translocation markers LBP and sCD14, probably due to its impact on the gut microbiota. Effective ART for 1 year does not restore gut-blood barrier dysfunction.";http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2014.0366;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

Evaluation of pretreatment HIV genotyping is needed globally to guide treatment programs. We examined the association of pretreatment (baseline) drug resistance and subtype with virologic failure in a multinational, randomized clinical trial that evaluated 3 antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens and included resource-limited setting sites. Methods. Pol genotyping was performed in a nested case-cohort study including 270 randomly sampled participants (subcohort), and 218 additional participants failing ART (case group). Failure was defined as confirmed viral load (VL) >1000 copies/mL. Cox proportional hazards models estimated resistance-failure association. Results. In the representative subcohort (261/270 participants with genotypes; 44% women; median age, 35 years; median CD4 cell count, 151 cells/L; median VL, 5.0 log<inf>10</inf> copies/mL; 58% non-B subtypes), baseline resistance occurred in 4.2%, evenly distributed among treatment arms and subtypes. In the subcohort and case groups combined (466/488 participants with genotypes), used to examine the association between resistance and treatment failure, baseline resistance occurred in 7.1% (9.4% with failure, 4.3% without). Baseline resistance was significantly associated with shorter time to virologic failure (hazard ratio [HR], 2.03; P =. 035), and after adjusting for sex, treatment arm, sex-treatment arm interaction, pretreatment CD4 cell count, baseline VL, and subtype, was still independently associated (HR, 2.1; P =. 05). Compared with subtype B, subtype C infection was associated with higher failure risk (HR, 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.35), whereas non-B/C subtype infection was associated with longer time to failure (HR, 0.47; 95% CI,. 22-.98). Conclusions. In this global clinical trial, pretreatment resistance and HIV-1 subtype were independently associated with virologic failure.

This study investigated the suitability of didanosine-based 2 nd-line regimens for children in the context of antiretroviral drug resistance patterns emerging after 1st-line virologic failure. Methods: A retrospective dataset of 354 antiretroviral drug resistant genotypes from children failing either abacavir (n = 81) or stavudine (n = 273) based 1st-line regimens, was analysed. Samples were sent to the HIV genotyping laboratory at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, for routine testing. Pol sequences were submitted to the Stanford HIV drug resistance database for genotypic predictions. Results: Children were exposed to abacavir or stavudine-based 1st-line regimens for an average of 21 and 36 months, respectively. The frequency of reduced susceptibility to didanosine was substantial in the abacavir-exposed group (69.1%). This reduced susceptibility was commonly attributed to L74V/I (n = 44) and to a lesser extent K65R (n = 10) mutations. Didanosine resistance was observed in 43.2% of patients exposed to stavudine-based regimens. In contrast, most children remained susceptible to stavudine regardless of exposure to abacavir (77.8%) or stavudine (74.7%). At least 80% of children remained susceptible to zidovudine irrespective of stavudine or abacavir-exposure. The presence of the K65R mutation was more common after abacavir pressure (12.3% vs 1.8%). Conclusion: Analysis revealed that didanosine-based 2nd-line regimens have limitations for South African children, given the high frequency of mutations that confer cross-resistance to didanosine; especially after abacavir-exposure. This data has influenced South African paediatric treatment guidelines, which now recommend zidovudine-based 2nd-line regimens. © 2014 Steegen et al.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0097067;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e97067;;

In healthy volunteers, darunavir exposure was comparable when darunavir 800 mg once daily was co-administered with cobicistat 150 mg once daily (as single agents or a fixed-dose combination) vs. with ritonavir 100 mg once daily. Methods: This 48-week, Phase IIIb, single-arm, US multicenter study (NCT01440569) evaluated safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg once daily (as single agents) plus two investigator-selected nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs) in HIV-1-infected adults. Patients had no darunavir resistance-associated mutations (RAMs), plasma viral load (VL) 1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml, eGFR 80 ml/min and genotypic sensitivity to the two N[t]RTIs. The primary endpoint was any treatment-emergent grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) through Week 24. Results: The majority of the 313 intent-to-treat patients were treatment-naïve (295/313; 94%), male (89%), White (60%) and received a tenofovir-based regimen (99%). Median baseline VL and CD4+ count overall were 4.8 log10 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml and 361 cells/mm3, respectively. Overall, 86% of patients (268/313) completed the study. The majority of discontinuations were for AEs (15/313; 5%). The incidence of treatment-emergent grade 3 or 4 AEs regardless of causality was 6% through Week 24 and 8% through Week 48. Most common AEs through Week 48 were diarrhea (27%) and nausea (23%), which were grade 1 or 2 in severity. Week 48 virologic response rates (% with VL <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml; Snapshot analysis) were 81% overall and 83% in treatment-naïve patients; median increases in CD4+ count at 48 weeks were 167 and 169 cells/mm3, respectively. Of 15/313 patients who met the criteria for resistance analysis, one developed a darunavir RAM as a mixture with wild-type (I84I/V), without phenotypic resistance to darunavir. The mean population pharmacokinetic-derived darunavir areas under the plasma concentration-time curve were 102,000 overall and 100,620 ng•h/ml in treatment-naïve patients. No clinically relevant relationships were seen between darunavir exposure and virologic response, AEs or laboratory parameters.

We investigated NK cell function, as measured by ADCC, in HIV-1-positive individuals before and 6 months after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation. METHOD:: The ability of antibodies and NK cells to mediate ADCC was investigated separately and in combination in an autologous model. The NK cell subset distribution and NK cell phenotype (ie, expression of maturation and activation markers within NK cell subsets) were analyzed. RESULTS:: The ability of NK cells to mediate ADCC was significantly increased after only 6 months of HAART and was not explained by a normalization of NK cell subsets (CD56 CD16 and CD56 CD16 NK cells) but rather by normalization in the frequency of NK cells expressing CCR7 and CD27. For individuals with no increase in ADCC after 6 months of HAART, the frequency of NK cells expressing NKp46 was downregulated. The ability of antibodies to mediate ADCC alone and in combination in an autologous model was not improved. CONCLUSIONS:: HAART improves the ability of NK cells to mediate ADCC after 6 months. This improvement does not correlate with general immune restoration, as measured by CD4 T-cell counts, but rather to a decrease in the frequency of NK cells expressing CCR7 and CD27.;http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201502010-00001;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

Recent clinical studies of in vivo administration of the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA; vorinostat) show increases in unspliced cellular HIV-1 RNA levels in resting CD 4+ T cells. A critical unknown, however, is the proportion of latent proviruses that can be transcriptionally reactivated by SAHA or T-cell activation. In this study, we quantified the fraction of HIV-1 proviruses in resting CD4+ T cells from patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy that were reactivated ex vivo with SAHA or antibodies to CD3/CD28. At concentrations of SAHA achieved clinically, only 0.079% of proviruses in resting CD4+ T cells were reactivated to produce virions, compared with 1.5% of proviruses in cells treated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies after correcting for spontaneous virion production in the medium control. A significant positive correlation ( = 0.67, P < 0.001) was found between levels of virions in the supernatant and unspliced cellular HIV-1 RNA following anti-CD3/CD28 treatment, but not following SAHA treatment ( = 0.21, P = 0.99).

However, there is limited published data from the Lake Victoria zone of Tanzania regarding the effectiveness of various regimens used for PMTCT. This study was done to assess the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy in preventing mother to child transmission of HIV Methods: Infants aged <i8 months born to HIV positive mothers undertaking PMTCT programme and those with no intervention program from Mara, Kagera, Mwanza and Shinyanga were tested for HIV-1 DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Data were analysed using STATA version 10.0 to assess factors associated with outcome. Results: A total of 1,005 study subjects were enrolled in the study. Of these 55% (554/1005) were females. Majority (82.6%; 830/1005) of the infants studied were aged 1-6 months. The median age of the infant studied was 3 months (IQR 2-4). Out of 1005 non-repetitive samples; 61(6.1%) were HIV-1 DNA PCR positive. Positive dried blood spots (DBS) rates by region were 6.4%, 5.9%, 5.6% and 5.1% in Mwanza, Mara, Kagera and Shinyanga, respectively. During pregnancy interventions, the positive rate for women with no therapy was 12.6% and for zidovudine alone was 5.4% while for triple antiretroviral therapy was 0.5%. Women who were in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during pregnancy had significantly lower positive rate than those without HAART treatment (p=0.001). Of 755 infants who received nevirapine, 3.9% were DBS positive compared to 12.8% of those who didn't receive nevirapine (p=0.001). Conclusion: The use of antiretroviral therapy in the PMTCT programme is effective in reducing HIV transmission from mother to child.";None;0.7;0.5;0.8;18216404;;;

A fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet containing atazanavir (ATV) and COBI has been developed for the treatment of HIV-1-infected patients. Methods: This open-label, single-centre, single-dose, crossover study, randomized 64 healthy subjects to one of eight treatment sequences. Under light meal conditions, maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) to infinity (AUCINF) and AUC to the last measurable concentration (AUC0-T) for ATV and COBI administered as an FDC of ATV/ COBI (300/150 mg) were compared to those following administration as separate agents given together; bioequivalence was concluded if the 90% CIs of the geometric mean ratios fell within the predetermined range of 0.80, 1.25. ATV and COBI pharmacokinetic parameters following administration as the FDC or as separate agents were also compared under fasted conditions. The effect of food (light and high-fat meals) on the pharmacokinetics of ATV and COBI for the FDC was also assessed. Results: ATV and COBI administered in an FDC tablet were bioequivalent to the individual agents when given with a light meal. Under fasted conditions, pharmacokinetic parameters for ATV and COBI were similar for the individual components and the FDC. For the FDC, systemic exposure to ATV increased with a light meal compared to fasted conditions, and ATV concentration 24 h post-dose was similar with a light meal compared with a high-fat meal. Conclusions: ATV/COBI (300/150 mg) FDC tablet was bioequivalent to coadministration as separate agents with a light meal in healthy subjects.

Aim of the study was to assess the impact of TDR on treatment success of resistance test-guided first-line therapy in the German HIV-1 Seroconverter Cohort for patients infected with HIV between 1996 and 2010. An update of the prevalence of TDR and trend over time was performed. Methods: Data of 1,667 HIV-infected individuals who seroconverted between 1996 and 2010 were analysed. The WHO drug resistance mutations list was used to identify resistance-associated HIV mutations in drug-naïve patients for epidemiological analysis. For treatment success analysis the Stanford algorithm was used to classify a subset of 323 drug-naïve genotyped patients who received a first-line cART into three resistance groups: patients without TDR, patients with TDR and fully active cART and patients with TDR and non-fully active cART. The frequency of virologic failure 5 to 12 months after treatment initiation was determined. Results: Prevalence of TDR was stable at a high mean level of 11.9% (198/1,667) in the HIV-1 Seroconverter Cohort without significant trend over time. Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance was predominant (6.0%) and decreased significantly over time (OR = 0.92, CI = 0.87-0.98, p = 0.01). Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (2.4%; OR = 1.00, CI = 0.92-1.09, p = 0.96) and protease inhibitor resistance (2.0%; OR = 0.94, CI = 0.861.03, p = 0.17) remained stable. Virologic failure was observed in 6.5% of patients with TDR receiving fully active cART, 5,6% of patients with TDR receiving non-fully active cART and 3.2% of patients without TDR. The difference between the three groups was not significant (p = 0.41). Conclusion: Overall prevalence of TDR remained stable at a rather high level. No significant differences in the frequency of virologic failure were identified during first-line cART between patients with TDR and fully-active cART, patients with TDR and non-fully active cART and patients without TDR. © 2014 zu Knyphausen et al.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0095956;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e95956;;

Methods: HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy-naive individuals in the HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration who started an antiretroviral regimen were classified according to the CNS Penetration Effectiveness (CPE) score of their initial regimen into low (<8), medium (8-9), or high (>9) CPE score. We estimated ""intention-to-treat"" hazard ratios of 4 neuroAIDS conditions for baseline regimens with high and medium CPE scores compared with regimens with a low score. We used inverse probability weighting to adjust for potential bias due to infrequent follow-up. Results: A total of 61,938 individuals were followed for a median (interquartile range) of 37 (18, 70) months. During follow-up, there were 235 cases of HIV dementia, 169 cases of toxoplasmosis, 128 cases of cryptococcal meningitis, and 141 cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for initiating a combined antiretroviral therapy regimen with a high vs low CPE score was 1.74 (1.15, 2.65) for HIV dementia, 0.90 (0.50, 1.62) for toxoplasmosis, 1.13 (0.61, 2.11) for cryptococcal meningitis, and 1.32 (0.71, 2.47) for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

Few randomized trials have evaluated glucose indices in antiretroviral-naive individuals on newer antiretroviral therapy (ART). METHODS:: A5224s was a substudy of A5202, a prospective trial of 1857 ART-naive participants randomized to blinded abacavir-lamivudine (ABC/3TC) or tenofovir DF-emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) with open-label efavirenz (EFV) or atazanavir-ritonavir (ATV/r). Analyses used two-sample t-tests, Spearman correlation coefficients and linear regression. RESULTS:: A5224s included 269 nondiabetic individuals: 85% men, 47% white non-Hispanic, baseline median age 38 years, HIV-1 RNA 4.6 log10copies/ml and CD4 cell count 233cells/l. Overall, significant 96-week increases occurred in fasting glucose, insulin and the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), P0.004. Assignment to EFV (versus ATV/r) resulted in significantly greater glucose increase [mean difference 4.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3, 7.5mg/dl; P=0.006] but not insulin or HOMA-IR (P0.72). Glucose indices were not significantly different between ABC/3TC and TDF/FTC arms, P0.18. Significant correlations were detected between changes in glucose indices and changes in BMI; all r0.23, P0.001. In multivariable analyses, in addition to the EFV effect, higher baseline HIV-1 RNA and greater BMI change were significant independent factors associated with greater glucose increase. CONCLUSION:: Changes in glucose metabolism were not significantly different between TDF/FTC and ABC/3TC-based regimens. A small but significantly greater increase in glucose was observed in those assigned to EFV. As glucose dysregulation may increase with time on ART, longer term studies will be needed to further clarify the clinical significance of these findings. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.";http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201406190-00008;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

We report a case of a naive patient, harboring a CRF11-cpx virus, which showed drug resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase. A drug resistance genotyping test was performed for the pol (protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase) and V3 regions. The initial clinical parameter results showed a 4 log level of HIV-RNA (12,090?cp/ml) and a very low CD4 + cell count (35 cells/l). We designed an initial highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen including lamivudine (3TC)+abacavir (ABC)+booster ritonavir (DRV/r). The virus was highly resistant to all nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) except for ABC, tenofovir (TDF), and efavirenz (EFV) and was susceptible to all protease inhibitors (PIs) and integrase inhibitors (INIs). A salvage regimen including raltegravir (RAL)+DRV/r was started. Ten months later, the immunovirological status shows CD4+ 142/l and HIV-RNA <37?cp/ml.

They had started an antiretroviral therapy at a median of 7.7 years (interquartile range, IQR 2.3 - 11.4), and had experienced a median of 4 therapeutic regimens (IQR 2-6). Twenty women (87%) had taken zidovudine (AZT) before pregnancy, in 14 cases as a starting monotherapy. In 21 pregnancies a protease inhibitor-based regimen was used. At delivery, the median of CD4+ T lymphocytes was 450/L (IQR 275-522), and no viral load was detectable in 15 cases (reported in 21 pregnancies). Twenty-eight children were delivered through caesarean section (median gestational age: 38 weeks, IQR 36-38, median birth weight: 2550 grams, IQR 2270 - 3000). Intravenous AZT was administered during delivery in 26 cases. All children received oral AZT (median: 42 days, IQR 31 - 42), with no adverse events reported. No child acquired HIV-1 infection.Conclusions: Despite a long history of maternal infection, multiple antiretroviral regimens and, perhaps, the development of drug-resistant viruses, the risk of mother-to-child transmission does not seem to have increased among the second-generation of HIV-1 exposed infants. © 2014 Calitri et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.";http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-277;4.5;4.3;4.1;;277;;

Elvitegravir (EVG) is the second integrase inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration when administered in combination with a novel pharmacoenhancer, cobicistat (COBI), and two nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). This combination of drugs (EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF) developed and marketed by Gilead Sciences Inc. (Foster City, CA, USA) as STRIBILD®, is the first integrase inhibitor-based single-tablet regimen administered once-daily. In the USA, it has been approved for use in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 patients with estimated creatinine clearance of >70 mL/min. The Department of Health and Human Services has approved EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF as one of preferred first-line regimens for HIV-1 treatment. In Europe, the European Medicines Agency has approved STRIBILD in treatment-naïve patients as well as in patients having no resistant mutation to any of the antiviral agents contained in STRIBILD.

Methods: Group-based, systematic review and meta-analysis of initial antiretroviral therapy studies, in adults, of 48 weeks duration, reported through December 31, 2012. Size-weighted, intention-to-treat efficacy was calculated. Parameters of study design/eligibility, participant and treatment characteristics were abstracted. Multivariable, random effects, linear regression models with backwards, stepwise selection were then used to identify variables associated with efficacy. Outcome Measures: Antiviral efficacy (undetectable plasma viral load) and premature cessation of therapy. Results: 114 studies were included (216 treatment groups; 40,124 participants; mean CD4 count 248 cells/L [SD 81]; mean HIV-1 plasma viral load log10 4.9 [SD 0.2]). Mean efficacy across all groups was 60% (SD 16) over a mean 82 weeks' follow-up (SD 38). Efficacy declined over time: 66% (SD 16) at 48 weeks, 60% (SD 16) at 96 weeks, 52% (SD 18) at 144 weeks. The most common reason for treatment cessation was participant decision (11%, SD 6.6). Efficacy was higher with 'Preferred' than 'Alternative' regimens (as defined by 2013 United States antiretroviral guidelines): 75% vs. 65%, respectively, difference 10%; 95%CI 7.6 to 15.4; p<0.001. In 98 groups (45%) reporting efficacy stratified by pre-treatment viral load (< or 100,000 copies/mL), efficacy was greater for the lower stratum (70% vs. 62%, respectively, difference 8.4%; 95%CI 6.0 to 10.9; p< 0.001). This difference persisted within 'Preferred' regimens. Greatest efficacy was associated with use of tenofovir-emtricitabine (vs. other nucleoside analogue backbones) and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (vs. other third drug classes). Conclusion: Initial antiretroviral treatments for HIV-1 to date appear to have suboptimal long-term efficacy, but are more effective when commenced at plasma viral loads <100,000 copies/mL. Rising viral load should be considered an indication for starting treatment. Integrase inhibitors offer a treatment advantage (vs. other third drug classes). © 2014 Lee et al.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0097482;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e97482;;

We evaluated trends and correlates of resistance in treatment failing patients in a comprehensive database over a time period of relevant changes in prescription attitudes and treatment guidelines.Methods: We analyzed 6,796 HIV-1 pol sequences from 49 centres stored in the Italian ARCA database during the 2003-2012 period. Patients (n = 5,246) with viremia > 200 copies/mL received a genotypic test while on treatment. Mutations were identified from IAS-USA 2013 tables. Class resistance was evaluated according to antiretroviral regimens in use at failure. Time trends and correlates of resistance were analyzed by Cochran-Armitage test and logistic regression models.Results: The use of NRTI backbone regimens slightly decreased from 99.7% in 2003-2004 to 97.4% in 2010-2012. NNRTI-based combinations dropped from 46.7% to 24.1%. PI-containing regimens rose from 56.6% to 81.7%, with an increase of boosted PI from 36.5% to 68.9% overtime. In the same reference periods, Resistance to NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs declined from 79.1% to 40.8%, from 77.8% to 53.8% and from 59.8% to 18.9%, respectively (p < .0001 for all comparisons). Dual NRTI + NNRTI and NRTI + PI resistance decreased from 56.4% to 33.3% and from 36.1% to 10.5%, respectively. Reduced risk of resistance over time periods was confirmed by a multivariate analysis.Conclusions: Mutations associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs at treatment failure declined overtime regardless of specific class combinations and epidemiological characteristics of treated population. This is likely due to the improvement of HIV treatment, including both last generation drug combinations and prescription guidelines. © 2014 Franzetti et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-398;4.5;4.3;4.1;;398;;

New compounds to activate these latent reservoirs have been evaluated so that, along with HAART, they can be used to activate latent virus and eliminate the latently infected cells resulting in eradication of viral infection. Here we describe three novel diterpenes isolated from the sap of Euphorbia tirucalli, a tropical shrub. These molecules, identified as ingenols, were modified at carbon 3 and termed ingenol synthetic derivatives (ISD). They activated the HIV-LTR in reporter cell lines and human PBMCs with latent virus in concentrations as low as 10 nM. ISDs were also able to inhibit the replication of HIV-1 subtype B and C in MT-4 cells and human PBMCs at concentrations of EC50 0.02 and 0.09 M respectively, which are comparable to the EC50 of some antiretroviral currently used in AIDS treatment. Control of viral replication may be caused by downregulation of surface CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 observed after ISD treatment in vitro. These compounds appear to be less cytotoxic than other diterpenes such as PMA and prostratin, with effective dose versus toxic dose TI>400. Although the mechanisms of action of the three ISDs are primarily attributed to the PKC pathway, downregulation of surface receptors and stimulation of the viral LTR might be differentially modulated by different PKC isoforms. © 2014 Abreu et al.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0097257;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e97257;;

In the present study, we assessed the influence of the CYP2B6 polymorphism on the plasma efavirenz level. Methods: CYP2B6 T18492C (rs2279345) in 149 HIV-infected Thai adults were genotyped. Plasma efavirenz concentrations 12 h after dosing were measured using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography. The relationship between the plasma efavirenz level and the CYP2B6 T18492C polymorphism were analysed. Results: Among the 149 patients, the frequency of T18492C heterozygous (T/C) and homozygous mutant (C/C) was 38.26 % (n = 57) and 6.04 % (n = 9), respectively. In the entire cohort, the median efavirenz plasma concentration was 2,410 ng/mL [interquartile range (IQR) 1,460-4,120 ng/mL]. The plasma efavirenz concentration for patients with 18492CC (1,200 ng/mL, IQR 1,050-1,990 ng/mL) or 18492TC (1,900 ng/mL, IQR 1,320-2,510 ng/mL) genotypes were significantly lower than those with homozygous wild type (3,380 ng/mL, IQR 2,040-5,660 ng/mL), P-value < 0.001. Conclusions: The CYP2B6 T18492C polymorphism was significantly associated with lower efavirenz concentrations compared to those with homozygous wild type in HIV-1 infections. The genetic polymorphism CYP2B6 T18492C may be useful for the optimised efavirenz dose. Further studies in the clinical setting will need to be conducted before such an approach can be recommended for widespread use. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s15010-013-0560-6;4.6;4.2;4.9;03008126;;;

Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) activity is suggested to be altered in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). We investigated PON1 activity in individuals receiving different regimens of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Methods. PON1 activity was evaluated in 91 HIV-1 seronegative and 624 HIV-1 infected individuals (115 were not undergoing therapy (ART-naïve), and 509 were receiving HAART). HIV-1 infected individuals were treated with the following: efavirenz (EFV; n = 195) or nevirapine (NVP; n = 95) or lopinavir/ritonavir (LOP/r; n = 219). Serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), HDL, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) fractions and the atherogenic indices (AI, TC: HDL, and LDL: HDL ratios) were determined. Results. PON1 activity (U/L) was lower in the ART-naïve group compared with the other groups. PON1 activity correlated with CD4+ T-cell number of ART-naïve group (r = 0,121; P = 0,014). The LOP/r group showed a reduction in HDL and an increase in AI (TC: HDL ratio) in comparison with other groups. Conclusion. PON1 activity was reduced in untreated individuals, but not in individuals receiving HAART. PON1 activity correlated with the number of CD4+ T-cells. The findings suggest that the activity of PON1 is associated with the immune status of HIV-1 infected individuals. © 2014 Luciana Morganti Ferreira Maselli et al.";http://www.hindawi.com/journals/dm/2014/480201/;3.9;4.3;3.5;02780240;480201;;

The objective was to provide updated recommendations for antiretroviral treatment (ART) of HIV-positive adults. Guidelines included the following topics: when to start, what to start, specific situations for the choice of the first session of antiretroviral therapy, optimization of antiretroviral therapy after virologic suppression, and management of virologic failure. Methods: Ten members of the French HIV 2013 expert group were responsible for guidelines on ART. They systematically reviewed the most recent literature. The chairman of the subgroup was responsible for drafting the guidelines, which were subsequently discussed within, and finalized by the whole expert group to obtain a consensus. Recommendations were graded for strength and level of evidence using predefined criteria. Economic considerations were part of the decision-making process for selecting preferred first-line options. Potential conflicts of interest were actively managed throughout the whole process. Results: ART should be initiated in any HIV-positive person, whatever his/her CD4 T-cell count, even when >500/mm3. The level of evidence of the individual benefit of ART in terms of mortality or progression to AIDS increases with decreasing CD4 cell count. Preferred initial regimens include two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tenofovir/emtricitabine or abacavir/lamivudine) plus a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (efavirenz or rilpivirine), or a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (atazanavir or darunavir). Raltegravir, lopinavir/r, and nevirapine are recommended as alternative third agents, with specific indications and restrictions. Specific situations such as HIV infection in women, primary HIV infection, severe immune suppression with or without identified opportunistic infection, and person who injects drugs are addressed. Options for optimization of ART once virologic suppression is achieved are discussed. Evaluation and management of virologic failure are described, the aim of any intervention in such situation being to reduce plasma viral load to <50 copies/ml. Conclusion : These guidelines recommend that any HIV-positive individual should be treated with ART. This recommendation was issued both for the patient's own sake and for promoting treatment as prevention. © 2014 Hoen B et al; licensee International AIDS Society.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.7448/IAS.17.1.19034;5.5;6.7;7.1;;19034;;

Dolutegravir provides distinct advantages compared with first generation integrase inhibitors. Unlike raltegravir, dolutegravir can be given once daily for patients who are antiretroviral treatment naïve. Once-a-day dolutegravir dosing also does not require a pharmacokinetic booster like elvitegravir which minimizes the drug-drug interaction potential of dolutegravir. In Phase III clinical trials, dolutegravir-containing regimens have demonstrated either non-inferiority or superiority to current first line agents such as raltegravir, darunavir/ritonavir, and efavirenz containing regimens. Moreover, dolutegravir may be effective for patients with a history of raltegravir and/or elvitegravir resistance. Dolutegravir will likely play a major role in the management of patients with HIV-1 infection, and will be aided when coformulation with abacavir/lamivudine as a single pill, once-daily regimen is available. © 2014 Informa UK, Ltd.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1586/14787210.2014.907525;5.7;5.6;5.4;14787210;;;

However, renal and metabolic safety of TDF compared to other NRTIs has not been well described in resource-limited settings. Methods: This was a secondary analysis examining the occurrence of renal abnormalities (RAs) and renal and metabolic serious non-AIDS-defining events (SNADEs) through study follow-up between participants randomized to zidovudine (ZDV)/lamivudine/ efavirenz and TDF/emtricitabine/efavirenz treatment arms within A5175/PEARLS trial. Exact logistic regression explored associations between baseline covariates and RAs. Response profile longitudinal analysis compared creatinine clearance (CrCl) over time between NRTI groups. Results: Twenty-one of 1,045 participants developed RAs through 192 weeks follow-up; there were 15 out of 21 in the TDF arm (P = .08). Age 41 years or older (odds ratio [OR], 3.35; 95% CI, 1.1-13.1), his- tory of diabetes (OR, 10.7; 95% CI, 2.1-55), and lower baseline CrCl (OR, 3.1 per 25 mL/min decline; 95% CI, 1.7-5.8) were associated with development of RAs. Renal SNADEs occurred in 42 participants; 33 were urinary tract infections and 4 were renal failure/insufficiency; one event was attributed to TDF. Significantly lower CrCl values were maintained among patients receiving TDF compared to ZDV (repeated measures analysis, P = .05), however worsening CrCl from baseline was not observed with TDF exposure over time. Metabolic SNADEs were rare, but were higher in the ZDV arm (20 vs 3; P < .001). Conclusions: TDF is associated with lower serious metabolic toxicities but not higher risk of RAs, serious renal events, or worsening CrCl over time compared to ZDV in this randomized multinational study.";http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1310/hct1506-246;2.8;2.7;0;15284336;;;

Nevertheless, poor adherence, especially of immigrants from Africa, leads to a high rate of treatment failures. Our study looked whether direct monthly ART supply in our AIDS centre has an effect on adherence and outcome. A total of 385 HIV (clade C) immigrants from Africa that were treated with ART for >2 years prior to the initiation of the study were evaluated. During the first 2 years, ART medications were supplied by local pharmacies. Thereafter (next 2 years), all patients received medications, monthly at our centre. Adherence, immunological (CD4) and virological (VL) outcome at the end of the two study periods were determined. At baseline, only 75% of the patients attended more than 90% of scheduled visits with 57% treatment adherence. Virological failure (VL >40 copies/ml) was observed in 53% of the patients. As a result of our intervention (2 years of direct monthly ART supply), visits and treatment adherence significantly increased (90% and 84%, respectively; p < 0.001). Concomitantly, virological failure rate significantly dropped to 28% (p < 0.001). Direct monthly supply of ART is a relatively low-cost mode to improve patient's adherence and immunological/virological outcomes. © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.";http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956462413515443;2.5;2.5;2.7;09564624;;;

Recent findings Understanding of HIV pathogenesis has progressed significantly, with a growing appreciation of the role of HIV replication in causing inflammation and promoting both AIDS and non-AIDS diseases. Early suppression of HIV replication with ART benefits the individual, and by reducing transmission and promoting engagement with care also brings public health benefits. For years, efavirenz-based ART was favoured by treatment guidelines, reflecting unsurpassed performance in clinical trials. New treatment options show high efficacy and safety and include single-tablet coformulations for once-daily dosing to improve convenience. Recent data have demonstrated superiority over efavirenz of regimens based on rilpivirine in patients with low pre-ART HIV-1 RNA load and raltegravir or dolutegravir regardless of the viral load. Summary Some guidelines now recommend starting ART regardless of CD4 cell counts, whereas others take a more cautious approach pending results from studies that are testing the clinical benefit of early therapy. New treatment options allow therapy to be tailored to the patient's circumstances and are suitable for early ART initiation.;http://journals.lww.com/00001432-201412000-00013;7.3;7.0;7.1;09517375;;;

Methods: A prospective cohort study of HIV-positive ART-naïve subjects attending 27 centres in Spain from 2004 to 2010 was carried out. Regimens were classified as recommended, alternative or nonrecommended according to the guidelines. Delayed start of treatment was defined as starting treatment later than 12 months after the patient had fulfilled the treatment criteria. Multivariate logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed. Results: A total of 6225 ART-naïve patients were included in the study. Of 4516 patients who started treatment, 91.5% started with a recommended or alternative treatment. The use of a nonrecommended treatment was associated with a CD4 count>500 cells/L [odds ratio (OR) 2.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-3.59], hepatitis B (OR 2.23; 95% CI 1.50-3.33), treatment in a hospital with <500 beds, and starting treatment in the years 2004-2006. Fourteen per cent of the patients had a delayed initiation of treatment. Delayed initiation of treatment was more likely in injecting drug users, patients with hepatitis C, patients with higher CD4 counts and during the years 2004-2006, and it was less likely in patients with viral loads>5 log HIV-1 RNA copies/ml. The use of a nonrecommended regimen was significantly associated with mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.61; 95% CI 1.03-2.52; P=0.035] and lack of virological response. Conclusions: Compliance with the recommendations of Spanish national guidelines was high with respect to the timing and choice of initial ART. The use of nonrecommended regimens was associated with a lack of virological response and higher mortality. © 2013 British HIV Association.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/hiv.12078;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;

The high local multiplicity of infection (MOI) observed at cell-cell contact sites may lower the efficacy of antiretroviral therapies (ART). Here we test the efficacy of commonly used antiretroviral inhibitors against cell-to-cell and cell-free HIV-1 transmission. We demonstrate that, while some nucleoside-analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) are less effective against HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission, most non-nucleoside-analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), entry inhibitors and protease inhibitors remain highly effective. Moreover, poor NRTIs become highly effective when applied in combinations explaining the effectiveness of ART in clinical settings. Investigating the underlying mechanism, we observe a strict correlation between the ability of individual drugs and combinations of drugs to interfere with HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission, and their effectiveness against high viral MOIs. Our results suggest that the ability to suppress high viral MOI is a feature of effective ART regimens and this parameter should be considered when designing novel antiviral therapies. © 2014 Agosto et al.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003982;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;e1003982;;

Dose selection for each cohort (I: 12 to <19 years; II: 6 to <12 years; and III: 2 to <6 years) was based on review of short-term safety (4 weeks) and intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation. Safety data through weeks 24 and 48, and grade 3 or serious adverse events (AEs) were assessed. The primary virologic endpoint was achieving HIV RNA <400 copies/mL or 1 log10 reduction between baseline and week 24.Results.

Of 96 final dose subjects, there were 15 subjects with grade 3 or higher clinical AEs (1 subject with drug-related [DR] psychomotor hyperactivity and insomnia); 16 subjects with grade 3 or higher laboratory AEs (1 with DR transaminase elevation); 14 subjects with serious clinical AEs (1 with DR rash); and 1 subjects with serious laboratory AEs (1 with DR transaminase increased). There were no discontinuations due to AEs and no DR deaths. Favorable virologic responses at week 48 were observed in 79.1% of patients, with a mean CD4 increase of 156 cells/L (4.6%).Conclusions. Raltegravir as a film-coated tablet 400 mg twice daily (6 to <19 years, and 25 kg) and chewable tablet 6 mg/kg (maximum dose 300 mg) twice daily (2 to <12 years) was well tolerated and showed favorable virologic and immunologic responses. © 2013 The Author 2013.

Whereas much attention has been placed on the clinical impact of minority drug- resistant variants in patients initiating antiretroviral therapy, their possible influence on the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy following prevention of mother-to-child transmission strategies in resource- limited settings remains largely unexplored. This review outlines the clinical significance and detection of minority drug-resistant variants, focusing primarily on studies of minority variants in the context of prevention of mother-to-child transmission and their possible influence on current regimens, especially those available in resource-limited countries. The clinical impact of minority nevirapine-resistant variants that arise in the context of prevention of mother-to-child transmission, for example, is an important factor to consider when these women initiate antiretroviral therapy that may include nevirapine or efavfrenz. Minority nonnucleo side reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant variants have been associated with treatment failure in women exposed to single-dose nevirapine. In countries like South Africa, with its longstanding use of single-dose nevira pine, this question is relevant as it is for other resource-limited countries where single-dose nevirapine is used. In the same context, various other minority drug-resistant variants (e.g. Y181C, K65R and thymidine analogue mutations etc.) are discussed. The field of next generation sequencing is very dynamic, with rapid improvements on present technologies and the introduction of novel technologies as discussed in this review. As the impact of minority drug-resistant variants in the setting of prevention of mother-to-child transmission becomes more evident, guidelines for this, especially in resource-limited countries, will need revision in order to optimize the clinical benefit from future antiretroviral therapy.;None;4.0;3.4;3.1;11396121;;;

In December 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) changed to include patients with CD4 counts between 350 and 500 cells/L. The aims of this study were to assess uptake of this recommendation in ART-naive youth with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and to describe the epidemiology of transmitted genotypic drug resistance mutations (DRMs) in this population.Methods. A multicenter, retrospective cohort study of ART initiation in ART-naive youth was performed. Eligible subjects were 13-25 years of age, were diagnosed with HIV within 1 year of presentation to care at the study sites, and presented to care from January 2007 to June 2011.Results. Of 685 potential subjects identified, 331 (49%) fulfilled inclusion criteria. Mean CD4 count at presentation to care was 452 cells/L. Overall, 191 (58%) subjects started ART. The mean CD4 count at ART initiation was 261 cells/L before and 363 cells/L after the 2009 guideline change (P <. 0001). Of 212 (64%) subjects with resistance testing available prior to ART initiation, 38 (18%) subjects had a major DRM and an increased proportion of resistance was seen in later study years.Conclusions. Our study demonstrated an uptake in recently changed guideline recommendations to treat HIV-infected individuals at higher CD4 counts and reinforces the importance of performing resistance testing at entry into care, as 18% of our population had major DRMs prior to initiation of ART. © 2014 The Author 2014.

A total of 100 HIV-infected subjects treated with efavirenz/lamivudine/tenofivir were prospectively enrolled. The panel of CYP2A6, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4/5 polymorphisms was genotyped. At steady state, plasma efavirenz concentrations were measured using high performance liquid chromatography. The relationship between host genetic and clinical factors in terms of efavirenz pharmacokinetics in HIV-1 infected Thai adults was analyzed. The minor allele frequency for CYP2A6-48T>G, CYP2B6 g.18492T>C, CYP3A41B c.-392A>G, CYP3A418 c.878T>C and CYP3A53 c.6986A>G was 0.14, 0.27, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.38, respectively. Univariant and multivariant analysis indicated associations for CYP2B6 g.18492T>C (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST; p = 0.001 and p = 0.006) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN; p = 0.011 and p = 0.016) with plasma efavirenz concentration. However, CYP2A6-48T>G, CYP3A41B c.-392A>G, CYP3A418 c.878T>C and CYP3A53 c.6986A>G had no significant impact on plasma efavirenz concentration in HIV-1 infected Thai adults. The CYP2B6 g.18492T>C polymorphism, AST and BUN were significantly associated with low efavirenz concentrations. The results from this study can be used to improve the prediction of efavirenz plasma concentration and to optimize its dose in antiretroviral therapy.

Twenty-five therapeutic agents belonging to five different classes are currently available for the treatment of HIV-1 infections. Advent of triple combination antiretroviral therapy has significantly lowered the mortality rate in HIV patients. However, fungal infections still represent major opportunistic diseases in immunocompromised patients worldwide. Areas covered: Antiretroviral drugs that target enzymes and/or proteins indispensable for viral replication are discussed in this article. Fungal infections, causative organisms, epidemiology and preferred treatment modalities are also outlined. Finally, observed/predicted drug-drug interactions between antiretrovirals and antifungals are summarized along with clinical recommendations. Expert opinion: Concomitant use of amphotericin B and tenofovir must be closely monitored for renal functioning. Due to relatively weak interactive potential with the CYP450 system, fluconazole is the preferred antifungal drug. High itraconazole doses (> 200 mg/day) are not advised in patients receiving booster protease inhibitor (PI) regimen. Posaconazole is contraindicated in combination with either efavirenz or fosamprenavir. Moreover, voriconazole is contraindicated with high-dose ritonavir-boosted PI. Echinocandins may aid in overcoming the limitations of existing antifungal therapy. An increasing number of documented or predicted drug-drug interactions and therapeutic drug monitoring may aid in the management of HIV-associated opportunistic fungal infections. © 2014 Informa UK, Ltd.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1517/17425255.2014.883379;5.7;5.9;6.4;17425255;;;

The STR reduces the risk of treatment errors, particularly in situations of selective non-compliance and therefore, limits the risk of emergence of HIV resistance mutations. Galenic researches and pharmaceutical industry collaborations may allow STR combining drugs with favorable pharmacokinetic profiles as HIV-1 non-nucleosidic reverse transcriptase inhibitors (efavirenz or rilpivirine), integrase inhibitors (cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir or dolutegravir), and protease inhibitors (cobicistat-boosted darunavir) associated with either tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine or abacavir/lamivudine. With the exception of renal or liver dysfunctions or drug-drug interactions requiring dose adjustments, the preferential use of STR should be recommended by guidelines in many antiretroviral-naïve or -experienced HIV-infected patients.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2210654514000465;0.2;0.1;0;22106545;;;

Methods: We carried out retrospective testing of baseline samples from patients entering the SENSE trial of first-line ART in Europe, Russia and Israel. Prior to randomization to etravirine or efavirenz plus two nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), plasma samples underwent routine Sanger sequencing of HIV-1 RT and protease (plasmaSS) in order to exclude patients with transmitted RAMs. Retrospectively, Sanger sequencing was repeated with HIV-1 DNA from baseline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCSS); baseline plasma samples were retested by allele-specific PCR targeting seven RT RAMs (AS-PCR) and ultra-deep RT sequencing (UDS). Results: By plasmaSS, 16/193 (8.3%) patients showed 1 transmitted RAM affecting the NRTIs (10/193, 5.2%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (4/193, 2.1%) or protease inhibitors (2/193, 1.0%). No additional RAMs were detected by AS-PCR (n = 152) and UDS (n = 24); PBMCSS (n = 91) yielded two additional samples with one RAM each. Over 48 weeks, 4/79 (5.1%) patients on etravirine and 7/78 (9.0%) on efavirenz experienced virological failure; none had baseline RAMs. Conversely, 11/79 (13.9%) patients randomized to etravirine had one polymorphic RAM from the etravirine score in baseline plasma (V90I, V106I or E138A), without any impact on virological outcomes. Conclusions: The detection of resistance increased marginally with PBMC testing but did not increase with sensitive plasma testing. A careful consideration is required of the cost-effectiveness of different strategies for baseline HIV drug resistance testing. © The Author 2013.

We conducted a comprehensive longitudinal analysis of viral evolution and its impact on primary and memory CD8+ T cell responses pre-seroconversion (SC), post-SC, and during combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Memory T cell responses targeting autologous virus variants reached a nadir by 8 years post-SC with development of AIDS, followed by a transient enhancement of anti-HIV-1 CTL responses upon initiation of cART. We show broad and high magnitude primary T cell responses to late variants in pre-SC T cells, comparable to primary anti-HIV-1 responses induced in T cells from uninfected persons. Despite evolutionary changes, CD8+ T cells could still be primed to HIV-1 variants. Hence, vaccination against late, mutated epitopes could be successful in enhancing primary reactivity of T cells for control of the residual reservoir of HIV-1 during cART. © 2013.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0042682213005758;6.3;6.6;5.2;00426822;;;

The Swedish Reference Group for Antiviral Therapy (RAV) updated the recommendations from 2010 at an expert meeting on 11 September 2013. The most important revisions are the following: (1) ongoing efficient treatment at confirmed pregnancy may, with a few exceptions, be continued; (2) if treatment is initiated during pregnancy, the recommended first-line therapy is essentially the same as for non-pregnant women; (3) raltegravir may be added to achieve rapid reduction in HIV RNA; (4) vaginal delivery is recommended if at > 34 gestational weeks and HIV RNA is < 50 copies/ml and no obstetric contraindications exist; (5) if HIV RNA is < 50 copies/ml and delivery is at > 34 gestational weeks, intravenous zidovudine is not recommended regardless of the delivery mode; (6) if HIV RNA is > 50 copies/ml close to delivery, it is recommended that the mother should undergo a planned caesarean section, intravenous zidovudine, and oral nevirapine, and the infant should receive single-dose nevirapine at 48-72 h of age and post-exposure prophylaxis with 2 drugs; (7) if delivery is preterm at < 34 gestational weeks, a caesarean section delivery should if possible be performed, with intravenous zidovudine and oral nevirapine given to the mother, and single-dose nevirapine given to the infant at 48-72 h of age, as well as post-exposure prophylaxis with 2 additional drugs. © 2014 Informa Healthcare.";http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/00365548.2014.898333;0;0;0;00365548;;;

Data relating to the impact of DBS storage and shipment conditions on genotyping efficiency under field conditions are limited. We compared the genotyping efficiencies and resistance profiles of DBS stored and shipped at different temperatures to those of plasma specimens collected in parallel from patients receiving antiretroviral therapy in Uganda. Plasma and four DBS cards from anti-coagulated venous blood and a fifth card from finger-prick blood were prepared from 103 HIV patients with a median viral load (VL) of 57,062 copies/ml (range, 1,081 to 2,964,191). DBS were stored at ambient temperature for 2 or 4 weeks or frozen at -80°C and shipped from Uganda to the United States at ambient temperature or frozen on dry ice for genotyping using a broadly sensitive in-house method. Plasma (97.1%) and DBS (98.1%) stored and shipped frozen had similar genotyping efficiencies. DBS stored frozen (97.1%) or at ambient temperature for 2 weeks (93.2%) and shipped at ambient temperature also had similar genotyping efficiencies. Genotyping efficiency was reduced for DBS stored at ambient temperature for 4 weeks (89.3%, P = 0.03) or prepared from finger-prick blood and stored at ambient temperature for 2 weeks (77.7%, P < 0.001) compared to DBS prepared from venous blood and handled similarly.

Patients and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the Dat'AIDS database on patients who were treated with ABC for the first time between 2003 and 2008. Results: Eight hundred and thirty-six patients were included. Before initiation of ABC, 26.3% has stopped the previous treatment because of immuno-virological failure, 30.5% because of adverse events, and 29.8% for other reasons. Thirteen percent were antiretroviral naive. One third of patients were ranked as CDC classC, and more than 2/3 had a viral load<5 log copies/mL or a CD4 count200mm3. ABC was mainly included in a combination containing 2 NRTI and 1 PI (63%), or 1 non-NRTI (16%). Thirty-two percent of patients were still treated with ABC after 2years of treatment and the median of ABC treatment was 11months (IQ 84days-2years). The main causes for stopping ABC were therapeutic simplification (47.4% of patients), intolerance (19.0%), and immuno-virological failure (9.8%). Suspected hypersensitivity reactions were the main cause of discontinuation due to intolerance (27.6%); the rate was 3.8% when ABC had been introduced before the routine use of the screening test HLA-B*5701. The incidence of myocardial infarction was 3.8 per 1000 patient-years; 70.6% of patients received a fixed combination including ABC after discontinuation of ABC as a single agent (Ziagen®). Conclusion: This retrospective analysis confirmed the effectiveness and the good tolerance of ABC in the therapeutic strategy, between 2003 and 2008. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0399077X1300293X;1.8;1.0;1.1;0399077X;;;

Previous tablet formulations of CVC, including spray-dried dispersion and a wet granulation with citric acid, had been found unacceptable for commercial use due to chemical and physical instability or unacceptably high excipient loading precluding fixed-dose combinability. A high drug loading, 26% (w/w), acidic microenvironment tablet formulation with fumaric acid solubilizer (1:1 CVC/fumaric acid) and a dry granulation process was developed iteratively through a sequence of prototypes characterized by beagle dog absorption studies, focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM), dynamic vapor sorption (DVS), and accelerated stability testing. The fumaric acid based dry granulated product demonstrated a mean bioavailability comparable to an oral solution dose in a dog model. Stability and moisture sensitivity of the formulation were improved via the dry granulation process technique and the use of fumaric acid. It is hypothesized that the observed slow dissolution kinetics of fumaric acid prolongs an acidic microenvironment around the agglomerated CVC crystals and excipients leading to increased CVC dissolution and thereby absorption. The fumaric acid formulation also demonstrated absorption resilience to gastric pH extremes in a dog model. This optimized formulation and process enables CVC to be a viable candidate for current HIV treatment paradigms of single once daily fixed-dose combination products. © 2013 American Chemical Society.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/mp400286s;8.2;7.4;7.5;15438384;;;

Studies identified--based on disease, instrument, PRO, and NNRTI medication terms were reviewed--to identify PRO instruments. Domains measured within each instrument were recorded to understand key areas of interest in NNRTIs.Results: Of 189 articles reviewed, 27 validated instruments were administered in 26 unique trials, with a mean of 1.9 instruments (median: 1; range: 1-7) per trial. The Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) was the most commonly used instrument (n = 8 trials). Seventeen trials (65%) included at least one multidimensional health-related quality of life (HRQL) instrument (HIV-targeted, n = 11; general, n = 8). Other validated instruments measured sleep (n = 5), depression (n = 5), anxiety (n = 4), psychiatric symptoms (n = 2), beliefs about HIV medications (n = 2), HIV symptoms (n = 1), and stress (n = 1).Conclusions: Although review of recent NNRTI trials suggests a lack of consensus on the optimal PRO instruments, a typical battery is comprised of a multidimensional HRQL measure coupled with one or more symptom measures. Further work is needed to clarify advantages and disadvantages of using specific PRO instruments to measure relevant constructs and to identify the most useful batteries of instruments for NNRTI trials. © 2013 Simpson et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.";http://hqlo.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1477-7525-11-164;3.6;3.5;3.9;;164;;

However, the use of RT inhibitors can lead to the emergence of drug-resistant variants. Until recently, most clinically relevant resistance mutations were found in the polymerase domain of RT. Lately, an increasing number of resistance mutations has been identified in the connection and RNaseH domain. To further explore the role of these domains we analyzed the complete RT sequence of HIV-1 subtype B patients failing therapy. Position A/T400 in the connection subdomain is polymorphic, but the proportion of T400 increases from 41% in naïve patients to 72% in patients failing therapy. Previous studies suggested a role for threonine in conferring resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors. Here we report that T400 also mediates resistance to non-nucleoside RT inhibitors. The susceptibility to NVP and EFV was reduced 5-fold and 2-fold, respectively, in the wild-type subtype B NL4.3 background. We show that substitution A400T reduces the RNaseH activity. The changes in enzyme activity are remarkable given the distance to both the polymerase and RNaseH active sites. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed, which provide a novel atomistic mechanism for the reduction in RNaseH activity induced by T400. Substitution A400T was found to change the conformation of the RNaseH primer grip region. Formation of an additional hydrogen bond between residue T400 and E396 may play a role in this structural change. The slower degradation of the viral RNA genome may provide more time for dissociation of the bound NNRTI from the stalled RT-template/primer complex, after which reverse transcription can resume. © 2013 Wright et al.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0074078;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e74078;;

Bone mineral density (BMD) decreases 2%-6% in the 2 years after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. Pre-ART immune deficiency and early immune recovery may contribute to this loss. Methods. We pooled data from 3 studies of ART initiation in treatment-naive patients in which serial whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans were performed. We used linear regression to evaluate effects of baseline CD4+ and 16-week CD4 + change (both absolute and relative) on 96-week total BMD change from baseline. We performed multivariable linear regression to assess associations between baseline variables of age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), hepatitis C status, parent study, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA level, and assignment to a protease inhibitor (PI)- or tenofovir-containing regimen on 96-week total BMD change. Results. The included 796 subjects had mean 96-week total BMD loss of 2.0%. In multivariable analysis, baseline CD4+ cell count was significantly associated with 96-week BMD loss; individuals with baseline CD4+ <50 cells/L lost significantly more BMD compared to those with CD4+ 500 cells/L. A greater relative, but not absolute, 16-week increase in CD4 + count was significantly associated with greater declines in BMD, but not after controlling for baseline CD4+ count. In multivariable analysis, older age, female sex, lower BMI, higher HIV-1 RNA levels, and PI and tenofovir assignment were also associated with greater BMD decline. Conclusions. Low pretreatment CD4+ count, but not greater CD4+ count increase, is a strong and independent risk factor for bone loss after ART initiation. ART initiation at higher CD4+ counts may reduce the burden of osteoporosis and fragility fractures. © The Author 2013.";https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/cid/cit538;14.0;13.8;12.5;10584838;;;

However, there are limited data comparing the safety of these therapies with long-term use. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term safety of these commonly used irst-line nucleoside/nucleotide combinations each administered with efavirenz (EFV). Methods: This open-label, 96-week, randomized study compared the safety (renal, bone and metabolic) and efficacy of ABC/3TC and TDF/FTC plus EFV in HLA-B*5701-negative antiretroviral-naive adults. Results: A total of 385 subjects were enrolled, and 249 (65%) subjects completed the study. The difference in changes from baseline in estimated glomerular iltration rate (calculated by the Modiied Diet in Renal Disease equation) between treatment arms was not signiicant. There was a signiicant difference between the arms (P<0.0001) for markers of tubular dysfunction (retinol-binding protein and ß-2 microglobulin) favouring ABC/3TC. Hip bone mineral density decreased from baseline in both arms, with a signiicantly greater decline with TDF/FTC (ABC/3TC-2.2% and TDF/FTC-3.5%; P<0.001 at week 96). Subjects in the ABC/3TC arm had greater increases from baseline in median total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Adverse events were similar between arms. The virological failure rate was low in both arms. Conclusions: ABC/3TC and TDF/FTC in combination with EFV minimally affected estimated glomerular iltration rate over 96 weeks. TDF/FTC was associated with greater increases in tubular dysfunction and bone turnover marker levels, greater decreases in hip bone mineral density, and smaller increases in serum lipid levels. © 2013 International Medical Press.";http://www.intmedpress.com/journals/avt/abstract.cfm?id=2667&pid=48;4.4;4.1;3.9;13596535;;;

We aimed to assess the association of immune activation and the occurrence of blips. Methods: HIV-infected patients from our out-patient cohort who developed a blip after having been on fully suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least 180 days were matched with patients without blips according to duration of complete viral suppression (CVS), age, sex and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stage. Frequencies of CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD3+HLA-DR+, CD4+CD45RA+, CD16+CD56+CD3- and CD19+ cells, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and clinical parameters, were included in conditional logistic regression models. Adherence to HAART was assessed by measuring prescribed nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or protease inhibitor (PI) plasma levels in a sample of 57 patients. Results: Eighty-two patients with viral blip were matched with 82 controls from the same cohort. The mean age was 47.2 years [standard deviation (SD) 12.1 years], 80.5% of patients were male and 42.7% had CDC stage C disease. Viral blips occurred after a median of 14 months [interquartile range (IQR) 8-34 months] of CVS. In the logistic regression, activated CD3+HLA-DR+ lymphocytes [odds ratio (OR) 1.25 per 100cells/L; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.54; P=0.03] were significantly associated with blips and there was a trend for an association of longer time on HAART with blips (OR 1.31 per year; 95% CI 0.96-1.78; P=0.09). No between-group difference regarding subtherapeutic drug levels was found (P=0.46). Conclusions: The occurrence of viral blips after suppressive HAART was associated with elevated markers of T-cell activation. Blips may identify a subset of patients with higher immune activation and increased risk for HIV disease progression. © 2014 British HIV Association.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/hiv.12134;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;

Etravirine (ETR) has demonstrated good tolerability in clinical trials and may be an option for patients who switch therapy due to adverse events. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all patients who had switched to an ETR-containing regimen in our center due to side effects. Virological suppression, ETR discontinuation, and reasons for discontinuation were studied. Results: A total of 78 patients started treatment with ETR in our center due to previous regimen toxicity. Most of them were men (83.3%), and the median time of infection was 14 years (IQR, 6.5-20 years). HIV RNA was <35 copies/mL in 88.3% of patients, although 33% had archived non-nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations that did not compromise ETR efficacy. Efavirenz was the drug most often replaced (38.5%), followed by atazanavir (20.5%) and lopinavir (6.4%). The fixed combination of Trizivir was changed in another 10.3% of patients. After a median follow-up of 14 months (IQR, 6-23), the rate of virologic suppression was 79.5% and 98.4% in intention-to-treat and on-treatment analysis, respectively. Seven patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events (3 gastrointestinal disturbances, 2 rashes, 1 swelling, and 1 neuropathy).

Antiretroviral drug selection in resource-limited settings is often dictated by strict protocols as part of a public health strategy. The objective of this retrospective study was to examine if the HIV-TRePS online treatment prediction tool could help reduce treatment failure and drug costs in such settings. Methods. The HIV-TRePS computational models were used to predict the probability of response to therapy for 206 cases of treatment change following failure in India. The models were used to identify alternative locally available 3-drug regimens, which were predicted to be effective. The costs of these regimens were compared to those actually used in the clinic. Results. The models predicted the responses to treatment of the cases with an accuracy of 0.64. The models identified alternative drug regimens that were predicted to result in improved virological response and lower costs than those used in the clinic in 85% of the cases. The average annual cost saving was $364 USD per year (41%). Conclusions. Computational models that do not require a genotype can predict and potentially avoid treatment failure and may reduce therapy costs. The use of such a system to guide therapeutic decision-making could confer health economic benefits in resource-limited settings. © 2013 Andrew D.

Methods: A5142 was an open-label study comparing 3 ARV regimens for the initial treatment of HIV-1. Subjects were randomized equally to efavirenz (EFV) plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) plus 2 NRTIs, or LPV/r plus EFV without NRTI. The NRTI regimen (lamivudine [3TC] plus zidovudine [ZDV], stavudine [d4T], or tenofovir [TDF]) was selected prior to randomization. TBMD was assessed via whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and 48 and 96 weeks. Analysis was modified intent-to-treat (ITT) ignoring regimen changes using all evaluations. Results: Significant mean declines in TBMD at week 48 were observed among subjects. In repeated-measures analysis of changes (including randomized regimen, NRTI used, and time), there was a significant difference in the NRTI-containing arms in mean percentage change in TBMD at week 48 according to NRTI used (P < .001). Subjects taking ZDV had similar changes to those taking d4T (P = .970), whereas those taking TDF had larger declines (P < .001). There was a nonsignificant trend toward greater mean declines among subjects taking LPV/r versus EFV (P = .080). Overall, TDF-containing regimens demonstrated the greatest losses in TBMD, while EFV regimens without TDF had lesser TBMD reductions even compared to the NRTI-sparing arm. From week 48 to 96, all treatment groups continued to lose TBMD at similar rates. Conclusions: Among NRTI-containing arms, NRTI selection, especially use of TDF, had a greater effect on TBMD change than randomized regimen. The long-term clinical significance remains to be demonstrated. © 2013 Thomas Land Publishers, Inc.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1310/hct1405-224;2.8;2.7;0;15284336;;;

Based on multivariate regression models, previous literature has concluded that the increase in survival of CD4+ T-cell appears to be the critical mechanism leading to sustained CD4+ T-cell levels in HIV-infected patients receiving intermittent IL-2 therapy. Underscored by comprehensive mathematical modeling, a major finding of the present work is related to the fact that, rather than due to any increase in survival of CD4+ T-cells, the expressive, selective and sustained CD4+ T-cell expansions following IL-2 administration may be related to the role of IL-2 in modulating the dynamics of Fas-dependent apoptotic pathways, such as activation-induced cell death (AICD) or HIV-specific apoptotic routes triggered by viral proteins. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022519313002919;4.0;3.9;4.1;00225193;;;

To develop new therapies, it is essential to know what cell types harbor residual HIV. We measured levels of HIV DNA, RNA, and RNA/DNA ratios in sorted subsets of CD4+ T cells (CCR7+, transitional memory, and effector memory) and non-CD4 + T leukocytes from blood, ileum, and rectum of 8 ART-suppressed HIV-positive subjects. Levels of HIV DNA/million cells in CCR7+ and effector memory cells were higher in the ileum than blood. When normalized by cell frequencies, most HIV DNA and RNA in the blood were found in CCR7 + cells, whereas in both gut sites, most HIV DNA and RNA were found in effector memory cells. HIV DNA and RNA were observed in non-CD4+ T leukocytes at low levels, particularly in gut tissues. Compared to the blood, the ileum had higher levels of HIV DNA and RNA in both CD4+ T cells and non-CD4+ T leukocytes, whereas the rectum had higher HIV DNA levels in both cell types but lower RNA levels in CD4+ T cells. Future studies should determine whether different mechanisms allow HIV to persist in these distinct reservoirs, and the degree to which different therapies can affect each reservoir. © 2013 The Author 2013.;https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/infdis/jit308;10.4;9.2;9.0;00221899;;;

Methods: We searched two databases up to June 30 2013 to identify randomized and quasi-randomized trials in which lamivudine and emtricitabine were used as part of combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment-naïve or experienced HIV-positive adult patients. We only included trials where partner drugs in the regimen were identical or could be considered to be comparable. We allowed for comparisons between tenofovir and abacavir provided the study population did not begin treatment with a viral load >100,000 copies/ml. Results: 12 trials contributed 15 different randomized comparisons providing data on 2251 patients receiving lamivudine and 2662 patients receiving emtricitabine. Treatment success was not significantly different in any of the 12 trials. In the three trials that directly compared lamivudine and emtricitabine, the relative risk for achieving treatment success was non-significant (RR 1.03 95%CI 0.96-1.10). For all trials combined, the pooled relative risk for treatment success was not significantly different (RR 1.00, 95%CI 0.97-1.02). No heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 0). Similarly, there was no difference in the pooled relative risk for treatment failure (RR 1.08, 95%CI 0.94-1.22, I2 = 3.4%). Conclusions: The findings of this systematic review suggest that lamivudine and emtricitabine are clinically equivalent. © 2013 Ford et al.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0079981;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e79981;;

We determined the effectiveness of first-line ART in a real world pediatric HIV clinic and explored associations between readily obtainable patient data and the trajectories of change in CD4 count and HIV viral load. Methods: We performed a longitudinal study of a cohort of HIV-infected children initiating ART at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital Pediatric HIV clinic in Accra, Ghana, aged 0-13 years from 2009-2012. CD4 and viral load testing were done every 4 to 6 months and genotypic resistance testing was performed for children failing therapy. A mixed linear modeling approach, combining fixed and random subject effects, was employed for data analysis. Results: Ninety HIV-infected children aged 0 to 13 years initiating ART were enrolled. The effectiveness of first-line regimen among study participants was 83.3%, based on WHO criteria for virologic failure. Fifteen of the 90 (16.7%) children met the criteria for virologic treatment failure after at least 24 weeks on ART. Sixty-seven percent virologic failures harbored viruses with  1 drug resistant mutations (DRMs); M184V/K103N was the predominant resistance pathway. Age at initiation of therapy, child's gender, having a parent as a primary care giver, severity of illness, and type of regimen were associated with treatment outcomes. Conclusions: First-line ART regimens were effective and well tolerated. We identified predictors of the trajectories of change in CD4 and viral load to inform targeted laboratory monitoring of ART among HIV-infected children in resource-limited countries. © 2013 Barry et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.";http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-13-476;4.5;4.3;4.1;;476;;

This benefit can be offset by increased transmitted drug resistance (TDR). We compared the preventive benefits of reducing incident infections with the potential TDR increase in East Africa. Methods: A mathematical model was constructed to represent Kampala, Uganda, and Mombasa, Kenya. We predicted the effect of initiating treatment at different immunological thresholds (350, 500 CD4+ cells/ml) on infections averted and mutationspecific TDR prevalence over 10 years compared to initiating treatment at CD4+ cell count below 200 cells/ml. Results: When initiating treatment at CD4+ cell count below 350 cells/ml, we predict 18 [interquartile range (IQR) 11-31] and 46 (IQR 30-83) infections averted for each additional case of TDR in Kampala and Mombasa, respectively, and 22 (IQR 17-35) and 32 (IQR 21-57) infections averted when initiating at below 500. TDR is predicted to increase most strongly when initiating treatment at CD4+ cell count below 500 cells/ml, from 8.3% (IQR 7.7-9.0%) and 12.3% (IQR 11.7-13.1%) in 2012 to 19.0% (IQR 16.5-21.8%) and 19.2% (IQR 17.1-21.5%) in 10 years in Kampala and Mombasa, respectively. The TDR epidemic at all immunological thresholds was comprised mainly of resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. When 80-100% of individuals with virological failure are timely switched to second-line therapy, TDR is predicted to decline irrespective of treatment initiation threshold. Conclusion: Averted HIV infections due to the expansion of antiretroviral treatment eligibility offset the risk of transmitted drug resistance, as defined by more infections averted than TDR gained. The effectiveness of first-line non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based therapy can be preserved by improving switching practices to second-line therapy. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health.;http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201401020-00009;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

These tests are based on bulk population sequencing and thus consider only variants representing more than 20% of the viral population, whereas next generation sequencing methods allow detection below this threshold. We aimed to evaluate the potential use of ultradeep pyrosequencing (UDPS) for genotypic resistance testing in clinical routine at the University Hospital of Bordeaux, France. We performed UDPS on reverse transcriptase (RT) from 47 HIV-1 individuals, naive of antiretroviral treatment and for whom genotypic resistance testing was requested for clinical management in 2011-2012. In 8.5% of the patients, only low-frequency variants harboring RT drug resistance mutations were detected raising the question of their clinical significance. Rilpivirine-associated resistance mutations were detected in 19.1% of our population study. To conclude, UDPS could become a routine tool for the evaluation of HIV-infected patients in hospital laboratories. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.;http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2013.0130;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

In high-income settings, the impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on survival has unmasked chronic liver disease from viral hepatitis B or hepatitis C as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with HIV infection. It is now feared that progressive liver disease may threaten the success of ART programmes in developing countries, where HCV or HBV testing and monitoring are not yet systematic among HIV-infected patients and ART use is generally blind to these co-infections. We set out to review recent data from Sub-Saharan Africa, in order to build a detailed and up-to-date picture of the epidemiology and emerging impact of HBV and HCV coinfection in countries at the heart of the HIV pandemic. There is a preponderance of HIV/HBV coinfection compared to HIV/HCV in this region, and significant caveats exist regarding the accuracy of published HCV seroprevalence surveys. Morbidity and mortality of coinfection is significant, and may be further enhanced in African populations due to the influence of host, viral and environmental factors. Careful scrutiny of the coinfection problem is vital to inform an approach to directing resources, planning public health initiatives, providing clinical care, and guiding future research. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1386653214002108;5.7;6.0;5.9;13866532;;;

However, the development of drug resistance, as well as the side effects of existing drugs, defines a medical need for novel NNRTIs with excellent tolerability, improved activity against NNRTI-resistant viruses, and a low barrier to resistance. Within the chemical class of diarylpyrazole-[ imidazolidinone]- carboxamides, AIC292 was identified as a promising novel HIV-1 NNRTI and has successfully completed single-dose clinical phase I studies. Here, we report on the antiviral activity of AIC292, evaluated in vitro against wild-type and NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 isolates and in vivo using an engineered mouse xenograft model. AIC292 inhibited wild-type HIV-1 laboratory strains at low nanomolar concentrations, was well tolerated in different cell lines, and showed excellent selectivity in a lead profiling screen. In addition, activity of AIC292 could be demonstrated against a broad panel of wild-type HIV-1 groupM and group O clinical isolates. AIC292 also retained activity against viruses harboring NNRTI resistance-associated mutations (RAMs), including the most prevalent variants, K103N, Y181C, and G190A. Interestingly, viruses bearing the L100I RAM were hypersusceptible to AIC292. Two-drug combination assays showed no antagonistic interactions between AIC292 and representative marketed HIV drugs with regard to antiviral activity. Furthermore, AIC292 displayed potent antiviral in vivo efficacy in a mouse xenograft model when applied once daily. Taken together, these data show that AIC292 represents a molecule with the antiviral properties of a novel NNRTI for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.

Previous biochemical and virological studies have shown that compensatory interactions between substitutions E138K and M184I can restore enzyme processivity and the viral replication capacity. Structural modeling studies have also shown that disruption of the salt bridge between K101 and E138 can affect RPV binding. The current study was designed to investigate the impact of K101E, alone or in combination with E138K and/or M184I, on drug susceptibility, viral replication capacity, and enzyme function. We show here that K101E can be selected in cell culture by the NNRTIs etravirine (ETR), efavirenz (EFV), and dapivirine (DPV) as well as by RPV. Recombinant RT enzymes and viruses containing K101E, but not E138K, were highly resistant to nevirapine (NVP) and delavirdine (DLV) as well as ETR and RPV, but not EFV. The addition of K101E to E138K slightly enhanced ETR and RPV resistance compared to that obtained with E138K alone but restored susceptibility to NVP and DLV. The K101E substitution can compensate for deficits in viral replication capacity and enzyme processivity associated with M184I, while M184I can compensate for the diminished efficiency of DNA polymerization associated with K101E. The coexistence of K101E and E138K does not impair either viral replication or enzyme fitness. We conclude that K101E can play a significant role in resistance to RPV.

The in vitro, protein-adjusted 90 % inhibitory concentration (IC90) of dolutegravir for wild-type virus is 0.064 g/ml, and it retains in vitro anti-HIV 1 activity across a broad range of viral phenotypes that are known to confer resistance to the currently marketed INSTIs, raltegravir and elvitegravir. Dolutegravir has a terminal elimination half-life of 13-14 h and maintains concentrations over the in vitro, protein-adjusted IC90 for more than 30 h following a single dose. Additionally, dolutegravir has low inter-subject variability compared with raltegravir and elvitegravir. A plasma exposure-response relationship has been well described, with antiviral activity strongly correlating with trough concentrations. Phase III trials have assessed the antiviral activity of dolutegravir compared with efavirenz and raltegravir in antiretroviral (ARV)-naive patients and found that dolutegravir achieved more rapid and sustained virologic suppression in both instances. Additionally, studies of dolutegravir activity in patients with known INSTI-resistant mutations have been favourable, indicating that dolutegravir retains activity in a variety of INSTI-resistant phenotypes. Much like currently marketed INSTIs, dolutegravir is very well tolerated. Because dolutegravir inhibits the renal transporter organic cation transporter 2, reduced tubular secretion of creatinine leads to non-progressive increases in serum creatinine. These serum creatinine increases have not been associated with a decreased glomerular filtration rate or progressive renal impairment. Dolutegravir's major and minor metabolic pathways are uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 and cytochrome P450 (CYP)-3A4, respectively, and it neither induces nor inhibits CYP isoenzymes. Thus dolutegravir has a modest drug interaction profile. However, antacids significantly decrease dolutegravir plasma exposure and should be separated by 2 h before, or 6 h after, a dolutegravir dose. In summary, dolutegravir is the first of the second-generation INSTIs and exhibits a predictable pharmacokinetic profile and a well-defined exposure-response relationship. Dolutegravir retains activity despite the presence of some class-resistant mutations and achieves rapid and sustained virologic suppression in ARV-naive and ARV-experienced patients. Clinically, dolutegravir is poised to become a commonly used component of antiretroviral regimens. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40262-013-0093-2;8.5;8.2;8.8;03125963;;;

Methods: The study was conducted in Spain in 6 hospital clinics and involved HIV-positive patients who needed to change their antiretroviral treatment (ART) for several reasons. They started fixed-dose combination (FDC) ABC/3TC (600 mg/300 mg), DRV (400 mg 2 tablets qd), and RTV (100 mg) from January 2010 to April 2012. The patients were evaluated at baseline and at intervals of 3 to 6 months, and at least once at the end of the follow-up. Adverse events (AEs), concurrent medications, HIV-associated conditions, and adherence were also assessed at each visit. Results: Seventy-six patients were included from 6 sites (60 male). Median CD4 cell count was 479/mm<sup>3</sup>, and the median time on follow-up was 10.1 months. Thirty-eight patients (50%) have reached 48 weeks of follow-up and 32 (84.2 %) have achieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL in this period. Immunological recovery was observed with a median CD4 count increase of 119 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> by week 48. There were no patients who discontinued the study treatment due to AEs, and all the toxicities that lead to change ART at baseline were resolved or improved substantially. Conclusion: This study showed that the study regimen provided consistent antiviral and immunological responses until 48 weeks. The antiretroviral effect of the regimen was observed in subsets of patients evaluated, including those with high baseline HIV-1 RNA levels and virological failure and those with switching, with little or no difference across subgroups. © 2013 Thomas Land Publishers, Inc.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1310/hct1405-254;2.8;2.7;0;15284336;;;

Methods: TRANxITION was an open-label, parallel-group, non-inferiority clinical trial where adult patients with undetectable viral loads, receiving NVP IR plus a fixed-dose NRTI combination, were randomized (2:1) to NVP XR or IR. After week 48, patients initially randomized to IR were allowed to switch to XR. Summary of results: At week 48, proportions of patients with virologic response (LLOQ=50 copies/mL TaqMan, FAS) were 88.5% (131/148) in the IR arm, and 88.8% (262/295) in the XR arm, observed difference of 0.3% (95% CI -6.1, 6.7). DAIDS grade 3/4 adverse events were similar in the XR and IR arms at week 48: 6.4% (19/295) vs. 6.1% (9/148). After week 48, all but 13 patients in the IR arm switched to XR. At week 144, the proportions of patients with virologic response were 95.0% (115/121) in those switching from IR to XR after week 48 [IR-XR post48], and 95.2% (238/250) in those on XR throughout [XR-XR post48]). DAIDS grade 3 and 4 events at week 144 in IR-XRpost48 (7.7%, [10/130]) differed from the XR-XR post48 group (11.2%, [31/276]). Conclusions: NVP XR QD resulted in continued virologic suppression at weeks 48 and 144. Up to week 144, rates of serious AEs were modestly higher than at week 24 in both post-week 48 XR arms, most likely due to the openlabel design of the study. © 2014 Arasteh K, et al.;https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/tranxition-week-results-switching-virologically-stable-hiv-patients-from-immediaterelease-nevirapine-nvp-ir-to-extendedrelease-nvp-xr-2155-6113.1000292.php?aid=25581;0;0;0;;1000292;;

We estimated the incidence of serious morbidity among HIV-infected adults receiving ART in one of these HIV routine care center in sub-Saharan Africa.Methods: We conducted a prospective study at the Centre Medical de Suivi des Donneurs de Sang (CMSDS), which is affiliated with the National Centre for Blood Transfusion in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. Adult patients infected with HIV-1 or HIV-1/HIV-2 who initiated ART between January 2003 and December 2008 were eligible for the study. Standardized clinical data were collected at each visit. Serious morbidity was defined as a new episode of malaria, WHO stage 3-4 event, ANRS grade 3-4 adverse event, or any event leading to death or to hospitalization.Results: 1008 adults, 67% women, with a median age of 35 years, and a median pre-ART CD4 count of 186/mm3 started ART and were followed for a median of 17.3 months. The overall incidences of loss to follow-up, death, and attrition were 6.2/100 person-years (PY) [95% CI 5.1-7.2], 2.3/100 PY [95% CI 1.6-2.9], and 8.1/100 PY [95% CI 7.0-9.4], respectively. The incidence of first serious event was 11.5/100 PY overall, 15.9/100 PY within the first year and 8.3/100 PY thereafter. The most frequently documented specific diagnoses were malaria, tuberculosis, bacterial septicemia and bacterial pneumonia.Conclusion: Among HIV-infected adults followed in routine conditions in a West African primary care clinic, we recorded a high incidence of serious morbidity during the first year on ART. Providing care centers with diagnostic tools and standardizing data collection are necessary steps to improve the quality of care in primary care facilities in sub-Saharan Africa. © 2013 Abo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-13-607;4.5;4.3;4.1;;607;;

We assessed the ability of the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat to disrupt HIV-1 latency and the safety of this strategy. Methods: In this phase 1/2 clinical trial, we included aviraemic adults with HIV treated at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. Participants received oral panobinostat (20 mg) three times per week every other week for 8 weeks while maintaining combination antiretroviral therapy. The primary outcome was change from baseline of cell-associated unspliced HIV RNA. Secondary endpoints were safety, plasma HIV RNA, total and integrated HIV DNA, infectious units per million CD4 T cells, and time to viral rebound during an optional analytical treatment interruption of antiretroviral therapy. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrial.gov, number NCT01680094. Findings: We enrolled 15 patients. The level of cell-associated unspliced HIV RNA increased signifi cantly at all timepoints when patients were taking panobinostat (p<0·0001). The median maximum increase in cell-associated unspliced HIV RNA during panobinostat treatment was 3·5-fold (range 2·1-14·4). Panobinostat induced plasma viraemia with an odds ratio of 10·5 (95% CI 2·2-50·3; p=0·0002) compared with baseline. We recorded a transient decrease in total HIV DNA, but no cohort-wide reduction in total HIV DNA, integrated HIV DNA, or infectious units per million. Nine patients participated in the analytical treatment interruption, median time to viral rebound was 17 days (range 14-56). Panobinostat was well tolerated. 45 adverse events were reported, but only 16 (all grade 1) were presumed related to panobinostat. Interpretation: Panobinostat eff ectively disrupts HIV latency in vivo and is a promising candidate for future combination clinical trials aimed at HIV eradication. However, panobinostat did not reduce the number of latently infected cells and this approach may need to be combined with others to signifi cantly aff ect the latent HIV reservoir.

Methods: A prospective open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted at 29 sites in Sweden and Norway between April 2004 and December 2009. Patients were randomized to receive either efavirenz 600 mg once daily (EFV), or atazanavir 300 mg and ritonavir 100 mg once daily (AZV/r), or lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily (LPV/r). The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml at 48 and 144 weeks. Results: Of 245 patients enrolled, 243 were randomized and 239 received the allocated intervention: 77 EFV, 81 AZV/r, and 81 LPV/r. Median (interquartile range) CD4 cell counts at baseline were 150 (80-200), 170 (80-220), and 150 (90-216) per microlitre, respectively. At week 48 the proportion (95% confidence interval (CI)) of patients achieving HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml was 86 (78-94)% in the EFV arm, 78 (69-87)% in the AZV/r arm and, 69 (59-78)% in the LPV/r arm in the intention-to-treat analysis. There was a significant difference between the EFV and LPV/r arm (p = 0.014). At week 144, the proportion (95% CI) of patients achieving HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml was 61 (50-72)%, 58 (47-69)%, 51 (41-63)%, respectively (p = 0.8). Patients with CD4 cell counts of  200/l or HIV-1 RNA > 100,000 copies/ml at baseline had similar response rates in all arms.

Data sources include PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and conference proceedings of the International AIDS Society, Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, between 1996 to May 2013. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals were synthesized using random-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic, and subgroup analyses performed to assess the potential influence of study design, duration of follow up, location, and tuberculosis treatment. Sensitivity analyses explored the potential influence of different dosages of NVP and different viral load thresholds.Results:Of 5011 citations retrieved, 38 reports of studies comprising 114 391 patients were included for review. EFV was significantly less likely than NVP to lead to virologic failure in both trials (RR 0.85 [0.73-0.99] I2 = 0%) and observational studies (RR 0.65 [0.59-0.71] I2 = 54%). EFV was more likely to achieve virologic success than NVP, though marginally significant, in both randomised controlled trials (RR 1.04 [1.00-1.08] I2 = 0%) and observational studies (RR 1.06 [1.00-1.12] I2 = 68%).Conclusion:EFV-based first line ART is significantly less likely to lead to virologic failure compared to NVP-based ART. This finding supports the use of EFV as the preferred NNRTI in first-line treatment regimen for HIV treatment, particularly in resource limited settings. © 2013 Pillay et al.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068995;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e68995;;

METHODS: Treatment-naive adults with HIV received DTG 10, 25, or 50â€Š mg once daily or efavirenz (EFV) 600â€Šmg once daily (control arm) combined with investigator-selected dual nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone regimen (tenofovir/emtricitabine or abacavir/lamivudine). The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50â€Šcopies/ml, based on time to loss of virologic response at 16 weeks (conducted for the purpose of phase III dose selection), with a planned analysis at 96 weeks. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. RESULTS: Of 208 participants randomized to treatment, 205 received study drug. At week 96, the proportion of participants achieving plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50â€Šcopies/ ml was 79, 78, and 88% for DTG 10, 25, and 50â€Šmg, respectively, compared with 72% for EFV. The median increase from baseline in CD4 cells was 338â€Šcells/l with DTG (all treatment groups combined) compared with 301â€Šcells/l with EFV (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.155). No clinically significant dose-related trends in adverse events were observed, and fewer participants who received DTG withdrew because of adverse events (3%) compared with EFV (10%). CONCLUSION: Throughout the 96 weeks of the SPRING-1 study, DTG demonstrated sustained efficacy and favorable safety/tolerability in treatment-naive individuals with HIV-1. © 2013 Creative Common License.;http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201307170-00010;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

Methods: Retrospective cohort of HIV-1 infected patients attending an outpatient HIV clinic in Vitoria, Brazil, between January/2010 and May/2011. Data, including blood pressure, dyslipidemia (high total cholesterol and low HDL-C), fasting glucose, and cardiovascular risk by Framingham Risk Score were abstracted from medical records from clinic visits six months prior and three years after starting ART. We assessed independent associated factors for dyslipidemia using multiple logistic regression. Results: Four hundred and ninety-eight patients on ART were studied. Median age was 45 years (interquartile range (IQR): 37-52), and median time since HIV diagnosis was 7.7 years (IQR: 3.8-10.0). The proportion of patients with dyslipidemia was 22.3% (95% CI: 18.6-25.9%) 36 months after ART initiation. Triglycerides levels >150. mg/dL (55.2% vs. 25.4%, p= 0.021) and high fasting glucose (5.8% vs. 2.3%, p= 0.034) were diagnosed more frequently after ART use when compared to baseline values. Multiple logistic regression analysis has shown dyslipidemia to be associated with lopinavir/r use [OR = 1.74 (95% CI: 1.12-2.86)]. Conclusion: These data show high chance of dyslipidemia after initiation of ART. Long-term follow-up will help identify the impact of ART on cardiovascular risk. © 2013 Elsevier Editora Ltda.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1413867013001062;2.5;3.0;3.2;14138670;;;

Given the high prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2/3 among HIV-infected women, we sought to examine the relationship between CIN2/3 andHIV-1 genital shedding amongwomen on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Materials and Methods. Paired plasma and cervical wick specimens for HIV-1 RNA measurements were obtained from 44 HIV-infected women with biopsy-confirmed CIN 2/3 (cases) and 44 age-matched HIV-infected women with normal cervical findings on colposcopy (controls). All subjects tested negative for sexually transmitted infections and had been stable on HAART for at least 3 months. HIV-1 viral load was measured in both blood and cervical specimens using commercial real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. Results. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 was not significantly associated with the detection or magnitude of plasma or cervical HIV-1 RNA shedding. HIV was detected in the plasma in 10 cases (23%) and 10 controls (25%) (odds ratio = 1.0; 95% confidence interval = 0.33-3.1). Cervical HIV-1 was detected in 6 cases (13.6%) and 9 controls (20.4%) (odds ratio = 0.61; 95% confidence interval = 0.20-1.90). Mean HIV-1 concentration in cervical secretions among women with CIN 2/3 who shed was 2.93 log10 copies versus 2.72 among controls (p = .65). Conclusions. Among women on HAART, we found no relationship between CIN 2/3 and HIV-1 genital shedding. © 2013, American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology.";http://journals.lww.com/00128360-201307000-00020;3.0;2.9;3.0;10892591;;;

The four HIV-1 groups arose from independent cross-species transmission of the simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) SIVcpz, infecting chimpanzees, and SIVgor, infecting gorillas. This, together with human adaptation, accounts for their genomic, phylogenetic, and virological specificities. Nevertheless, the natural course of non-M HIV infection seems similar to that of HIV-M. The virological monitoring of infected patients is now possible with commercial kits, but their therapeutic management remains complex. All non-M variants were principally described for patients linked to Cameroon, where HIV-O accounts for 1% of all HIV infections; only 15 cases of HIV-N infection and 2 HIV-P infections have been reported. Despite improvements in our knowledge, many fascinating questions remain concerning the origin, genetic evolution, and slow spread of these variants. Other variants may already exist or may arise in the future, calling for close surveillance. This review provides a comprehensive, up-to-date summary of the current knowledge on these pathogens, including the historical background of their discovery; the latest advances in the comprehension of their origin and spread; and clinical, therapeutic, and laboratory aspects that may be useful for the management and the treatment of patients infected with these divergent viruses. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.

Methods: An adherence and health status questionnaire was offered to all patients collecting their drugs between March and May 2010 at our clinic; both parameters were primarily evaluated using a visual analogue scale. Linear correlations were evaluated using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Wilcoxon's rank-sum test and the 2 test were used to compare quantitative and qualitative variables. The generalized linear model was used in multivariable analyses. Results: Among 2763 subjects on treatment during the study period, 2114 (78.8% male; mean age 46.9±8.84 years) were tested for adherence; 1803 (85.3%) had viral loads <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL. After adjusting for age, gender, HIV risk factor, current CD4 count, pill burden and dosing interval, adherence was higher in patients with undetectable HIV RNA (P<0.0001) and directly associated with current CD4 count (P=0.029). After adjusting for the same variables, health status was better in patients with undetectable viraemia (P=0.004) and in men who have sex with men (MSM) and heterosexuals compared with injecting drug users and those with other risk factors (P<0.0001 for MSM and P=0.008 for heterosexuals); it was also directly associated with current CD4 count (P<0.0001) and inversely associated with age (P<0.0001) and pill burden (P=0.019).

Methods: We studied the viral quasispecies and therapy response in 10 individuals with transmitted single nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-related resistance mutations as detected by population sequencing. Results: Ultra-deep pyrosequencing did not reveal additional drug-resistance mutations in nine of 10 patients. In these nine patients, no breakthrough with resistant viruses was observed despite the use of low genetic nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimens in the majority of patients. Conclusions: These data suggest that viral minority variants containing additional resistance mutations may be rare in patients with transmitted NRTI singletons in the Netherlands.

The aim of this study was to quantify the risk of resistance by sensitive testing and correlate the detection of resistance with NNRTI concentrations after treatment interruption and virologic responses after treatment resumption.Methods:Resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) and NNRTI concentrations were studied in plasma from 132 patients who interrupted suppressive ART within SMART. RAMs were detected by Sanger sequencing, allele-specific PCR, and ultra-deep sequencing. NNRTI concentrations were measured by sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography.Results:Four weeks after NNRTI interruption, 19/31 (61.3%) and 34/39 (87.2%) patients showed measurable nevirapine (>0.25 ng/ml) or efavirenz (>5 ng/ml) concentrations, respectively. Median eight weeks after interruption, 22/131 (16.8%) patients showed 1 NNRTI-RAM, including eight patients with NNRTI-RAMs detected only by sensitive testing. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of NNRTI-RAM detection was 7.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.52, 38.30; p = 0.01) with nevirapine or efavirenz concentrations above vs. below the median measured in the study population. Staggered interruption, whereby nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) were continued for median nine days after NNRTI interruption, did not prevent NNRTI-RAMs, but increased detection of NRTI-RAMs (OR 4.25; 95% CI 1.02, 17.77; p = 0.03). After restarting NNRTI-based ART (n = 90), virologic suppression rates <400 copies/ml were 8/13 (61.5%) with NNRTI-RAMs, 7/11 (63.6%) with NRTI-RAMs only, and 51/59 (86.4%) without RAMs. The ORs of re-suppression were 0.18 (95% CI 0.03, 0.89) and 0.17 (95% CI 0.03, 1.15) for patients with NNRTI-RAMs or NRTI-RAMs only respectively vs. those without RAMs (p = 0.04).Conclusions:Detection of resistant mutants in the rebound viremia after interruption of efavirenz- or nevirapine-based ART affects outcomes once these drugs are restarted. Further studies are needed to determine RAM persistence in untreated patients and impact on newer NNRTIs. © 2013 Geretti et al.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069266;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e69266;;

Ultradeep pyrosequencing has shown to be effective in detecting such mutations. The lack of a standardized commercially based assay limits the wide use of this method in clinical settings. 454 Life Sciences (Roche) is developing an HIV ultradeep pyrosequencing assay for their benchtop sequencer. We assessed the prototype plate in the clinical laboratory. Plasma samples genotyped by the standardized TruGene kit were retrospectively tested by this assay. Drug-treated subjects failing therapy and drug-naive patients were included. DRM analysis was based on the International AIDS Society USA DRM list and the Stanford algorithm. The prototype assay detected all of the DRMs detected by TruGene and additional 50 low-abundance DRMs. Several patients had lowabundance D67N, K70R, and M184V reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations that persisted long after discontinuation of the drug that elicited these mutations. Additional patient harbored low-abundance V32I major protease inhibitor mutation, which under darunavir selection evolved later to be detected by TruGene. Stanford analysis suggested that some of the low-abundance DRMs were likely to affect the resistance burden in these subjects. The prototype assay performs at least as well as TruGene and has the advantage of detecting low-abundance drug resistance mutations undetected by TruGene. Its ease of use and lab-scale platform will likely facilitate its use in the clinical laboratory. The extent to which the detection of low-abundance DRMs will affect patient management is still unknown, but it is hoped that use of such an assay in clinical practice will help resolve this important question.;https://jcm.asm.org/content/51/3/880;8.0;8.2;8.6;00951137;;;

Specifically, the use of the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus is problematic because of a narrow therapeutic range, a high interindividual variability of trough levels, and multiple interactions with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Our objective was to establish the optimal individual immunosuppressive dose for the time after kidney transplantation. We administered a temporary course of immunosuppressive therapy in three HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) after wait-listing and prior to transplantation for deceased donor kidney transplantation. Starting with a tacrolimus dose of 1 mg twice daily, the dose was titrated to reach a tacrolimus trough level of 8-12 ng/ml. HIV had been diagnosed 7-14 years prior. All patients had no detectable HIV-1 RNA while on cART. All three patients had been on chronic dialysis for 4, 7, and 10 years. In two patients, the intended tacrolimus trough levels of 8-12 ng/ml were achieved within a month. The required tacrolimus dose ranged from 0.5 mg thrice weekly to 10 mg daily. In one case, ventricular tachycardia occurred, so the immunosuppressive therapy was switched to cyclosporine A. So far, two patients have been transplanted successfully. In summary, dose-finding of immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus in patients on cART before renal transplantation is feasible and appears useful to minimize immunosuppressive therapy-related complications in the post-transplantation period. © 2012 The Authors Transplant International © 2012 European Society for Organ Transplantation.

Despite having a 30- to 40-h elimination half-life, etravirine was never considered for once-daily dosing during development due to an unacceptably high pill burden in phase II trials. However, a recently published study, SENSE, enrolled 157 HIV-positive patients in a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that investigated 400 mg etravirine once daily with two nucleosides versus a comparator arm that included efavirenz and two nucleosides. The primary objective was to assess neuropsychiatric tolerability over the 48-week study period, with comparative efficacy as a secondary objective. Using the intent-to-treat time to loss of virologic response (ITT-TLOVR) analysis at 48 weeks, 76 % of patients receiving etravirine had an undetectable viral load of <50 copies/mL compared with 74 % of patients receiving efavirenz. This translates to a suppression rate difference of 1.6 % favouring etravirine (95 % CI -12.0-15.2) and met the non-inferiority criteria of a delta of -12 %. Baseline viral load was not observed to impact clinical response rates. Pharmacokinetically and clinically, studies indicate the efficacy and safety of utilizing once-daily etravirine in the treatment-naive population.

Inhibitors of this enzyme represent the newest class of antiretroviral drugs in our armamentarium to treat HIV-1 infection. Raltegravir, an integrase strand transfer inhibitor, was the first drug of this class approved by the US FDA; it is a potent and well tolerated antiviral agent. However, it has the limitations of twice-daily dosing and a relatively modest genetic barrier to the development of resistance. These qualities have prompted the search for agents with once-daily dosing, a more robust barrier to resistance, and a resistance profile of limited overlap with that of raltegravir. We review a series of integrase inhibitors that are in clinical or advanced pre-clinical studies. Elvitegravir, recently approved by the FDA as part of the elvitegravir/cobicistat/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine fixed-dose combination pill has the benefit of being part of a one-pill, once-daily regimen, but suffers from extensive cross-resistance with raltegravir. Dolutegravir is the most advanced second-generation integrase inhibitor, and it boasts good tolerability, once-daily dosing with no need for a pharmacological enhancer, and relatively little cross-resistance with raltegravir. S/GSK1265744 has been developed into a long-acting parenteral agent that shows a high barrier to resistance in vitro and the potential for an infrequent dosing schedule. BI 224436 is in early clinical trials, but is unlikely to demonstrate cross-resistance with other integrase inhibitors. The inhibitors of the lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)/p75 binding site of integrase (LEDGINs) are extremely early in development. Each of these contributes a new benefit to the class and will extend the treatment options for patients with HIV-1 infection. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40265-013-0015-5;9.4;9.2;9.6;00126667;;;

Methods: This was a randomized 144-week follow-up CD4+ T-cell-count-guided treatment-interruption trial. HIV-1-infected adults with plasma HIV-1 RNA<50 copies/ ml, CD4+ T-cell count >500 cells/l and nadir CD4+ T-cell count >100 cells/l were randomized to continuous treatment (CT) or treatment interruption (TI) until CD4+ T-cell count decreased to <350 cells/l. The primary end points were AIDS-deining illnesses, death, CD4+ T-cell count <200 cells/l, or virological failure after restarting ART. Results: A total of 106 patients were included, 50 in the CT arm and 56 in the TI arm. A trend to a higher rate of primary end points was observed in the TI group (26.8% versus 14%, difference 12.8%, 95% CI -2.3, 27.8; P=0.105). In addition, 10 patients presented clinical events related with HIV rebound, including 8 cases of thrombocytopaenia. The CD4+ T-cell count signiicantly decreased in the TI group (even in patients with persistently high CD4+ T-cell counts and no clinical events) versus the CT group (median change -408 cells/l versus -21.5 cells/l; P<0.001), whereas a signiicant increase in CD8+ T-cell count was observed (256 cells/l versus -59 cells/l; P<0.001). The time to ART re-initiation was signiicantly associated with nadir and baseline CD4+ T-cell counts. Conclusions: Discontinuation of ART in patients with preserved immune function is followed by signiicant immunological impairment even in those with no clinical events, and may be associated with an increased risk of HIV-related complications. Hence, patients who stop ART voluntarily should be closely monitored, regardless of their CD4+ T-cell count. © 2013 International Medical Press.";http://www.intmedpress.com/journals/avt/abstract.cfm?id=2249&pid=48;4.4;4.1;3.9;13596535;;;

This analysis aimed to study the influence of different time patterns of adherence on virological failure after 24 months of treatment in Cameroon. Methods: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence data were collected using face-to-face questionnaires administered at months 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24. Virological failure was defined as viral load >40 copies/ml at month 18 and/or 24. Two combined indicators of early adherence (months 1, 3 and 6) and adherence during the maintenance phase (months 12, 18 and 24) were designed to classify patients as always adherent during the early or maintenance phase, non-adherent at least once and having interrupted ART for >2 days at least once at any visit during either of these two phases. Results: Virological failure occurred in 107 (42%) of the 254 patients included in the analysis. In the early and maintenance phases, 84% and 76%, respectively, were always adherent, 5% and 5% were non-adherent and 11% and 20% experienced 1 treatment interruption. Early non-adherence was independently associated with virological failure (adjusted OR 7.2 [95% CI 1.5, 34.6]), while only treatment interruptions had a significant impact on virological failure during the maintenance phase (adjusted OR 2.1 [95% CI 1.1, 4.4]). Conclusions: ART NNRTI-regimens used in sub-Saharan Africa seem to 'forgive' deviations from good adherence during the maintenance phase. Optimizing adherence in the early months of treatment remains crucial, especially in a setting of poor health care infrastructure and resources. © 2013 International Medical Press.;http://www.intmedpress.com/journals/avt/abstract.cfm?id=2535&pid=48;4.4;4.1;3.9;13596535;;;

Recently, once-daily administration of FTC/TDF was approved in the USA for pre-exposure prophylaxis in conjunction with safer sex practices to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 in high-risk adults who are not infected. To date, results of four large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trials with FTC/TDF as pre-exposure prophylaxis have been published. Three studies showed statistically significant reductions in the number of individuals with emergent HIV-1 infection when FTC/TDF was compared with placebo over the 1- to 2-year study periods. Efficacy (i.e. risk reduction relative to placebo) was 44 % in the iPrEx trial in men who have sex with men, 75 % in the Partners PrEP study in heterosexual HIV-1-serodiscordant couples and 62 % in the TDF2 trial in heterosexual men and women. The fourth study (FEM-PrEP) in heterosexual women did not show a statistically significant difference between FTC/TDF and placebo, although low adherence rates reported in this trial may have been a factor. No unexpected adverse events were reported in the trials. However, since pre-exposure prophylaxis involves long-term administration of drugs to healthy individuals, it is important to monitor the long-term safety of FTC/TDF (e.g. renal function, bone mineral density) in this setting. Other notable considerations include adherence, cost and the potential for development of drug resistance. Interim guidelines are available for prescribing FTC/TDF as pre-exposure prophylaxis. If used appropriately in selected high-risk individuals, pre-exposure prophylaxis with FTC/TDF represents an important additional strategy to reduce the spread of HIV-1 infection, which continues to be a significant global concern. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40265-013-0024-4;9.4;9.2;9.6;00126667;;;

We will discuss the challenges of using blood and marrow transplant strategies in this population, as well as the potential impact that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has on HIV-1 reservoirs and persistence. Recent Findings: Advances in stem cell transplantation and the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) have made it possible to extend curative cancer therapy to HIV-1-infected individuals with aggressive lymphoma and leukemia. Outcomes of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in HIV-1-infected individuals are similar to the general population. In allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT), there are a growing number of successful case reports and the first national trial is ongoing. Infectious complications do not appear to be increased in patients on effective ART; however, drug interactions and drug interruptions are common. There is also renewed interest in the possibility that alloHSCT could lead to HIV-1 cure. Summary: HIV-1 infection is not a contraindication to blood and marrow transplantation and may offer unique benefits. Particular attention to preventing infectious complications, drug interactions, and drug interruptions in this patient population is required. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.";http://journals.lww.com/00001622-201303000-00013;7.1;6.9;5.8;10408746;;;

To determine whether CN mutations in subtype C influence drug sensitivity, single genome sequencing was performed on Brazilian subtype C-infected patients failing RTI therapy. CN mutations identified were similar to subtype B, including A376S, A400T, Q334D, G335D, N348I, and A371V, and increased AZT resistance in the presence of thymidine analog mutations. CN mutations also enhanced NNRTI resistance in the presence of classical NNRTI mutations: etravirine resistance was enhanced 6- to 11-fold in the presence of L100I/K103N/Y181C. These results indicate that selection of CN mutations in treatment-experienced patients also occurs in subtype-C-infected patients and are likely to provide valuable information in predicting clinical RTI resistance. © 2012.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S004268221200462X;6.3;6.6;5.2;00426822;;;

Integrase inhibitors have swiftly been adopted as part of current antiretroviral regimens. The purpose of this study was to review the evidence for integrase inhibitor use in clinical settings. Methods: MEDLINE and Web-of-Science were screened from April 2006 until November 2012, as were hand-searched scientific meeting proceedings. Multiple reviewers independently screened 1323 citations in duplicate to identify randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials and cohort studies on integrase inhibitor use in clinical practice. Independent, duplicate data extraction and quality assessment were conducted. Results: 48 unique studies were included on the use of integrase inhibitors in antiretroviral therapy-naive patients and treatment-experienced patients with either virological failure or switching to integrase inhibitors while virologically suppressed. On the selected studies with comparable outcome measures and indication (n = 16), a meta-analysis was performed based on modified intention-to-treat (mITT), on-treatment (OT) and as-treated (AT) virological outcome data. In therapy-naive patients, favorable odds ratios (OR) for integrase inhibitor-based regimens were observed, (mITT OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.86). However, integrase inhibitors combined with protease inhibitors only did not result in a significant better virological outcome. Evidence further supported integrase inhibitor use following virological failure (mITT OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.11-0.66), but switching to integrase inhibitors from a high genetic barrier drug during successful treatment was not supported (mITT OR 1.43; 95% CI 0.89-2.31). Integrase inhibitor-based regimens result in similar immunological responses compared to other regimens. A low genetic barrier to drug-resistance development was observed for raltegravir and elvitegravir, but not for dolutegravir. Conclusion: In first-line therapy, integrase inhibitors are superior to other regimens. Integrase inhibitor use after virological failure is supported as well by the meta-analysis. Careful use is however warranted when replacing a high genetic barrier drug in treatment-experienced patients switching successful treatment. © 2013 Messiaen et al.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052562;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e52562;;

Methods: The frequency and patterns of HIV-1 drug-resistance mutations among the first-line failing HIV-infected patients attending a hospital in Salem, Tamil Nadu, India, were genotypically analyzed using the online Stanford HIV Database. Results: Of the study patients followed up for 6 months, 23 patients failed first-line therapy and the mutation of I135R/T/V/X, L178 I/M, M184V/I, D67N, K70R, and K103N was most common. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of these patients belonged to HIV subtype C. Conclusion: The study documents the frequency of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations that are prevalent in the first-line failing HIV-infected patients of South Indian region and adds up to the data for developing future algorithms to study the drug-resistance mutations of HIV subtype C. Thus, the results of the study call for the need for rational approach for selecting and for frequent viral monitoring to be performed to detect failure, followed by genotyping.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2325957415603508;2.3;2.3;1.8;23259574;;;

This study aimed to examine the frequencies of CYP2B6 and the association between CYP2B6 polymorphisms and plasma efavirenz concentrations in an HIV-1 infected Thai population. Mid-dose plasma efavirenz concentration was determined at 12 weeks following the initiation of an antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz) in 100 Thai adults with HIV-1 infection using high-performance liquid chromatography. Candidate CYP2B6 polymorphisms (c.64C>T, c.499C>G, c.516G>T, c.785A>G, c.1375A>G, c.1459C>T) were conducted by real-time PCR-based allelic discrimination. The most frequent polymorphisms among this cohort were the CYP2B6 c.785A>G and c.516G>T, which had a frequency of 0.36 and 0.32, respectively. From the cases observed, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (c.516G>T and c.785A>G) were significantly associated with high efavirenz plasma levels (p < 0.05). The most frequent haplotypic combinations were *1/*6, *1/*1, *1/*2 and *6/*6 at a frequency of 42.0%, 32.0%, 8.0% and 7.0%, respectively. Increased plasma concentrations of efavirenz were present in individuals with CYP2B6 *6/*6 [7.210 mg/L; interquartile range (IQR), 5.0209.260] when compared to those with CYP2B6*1/*1 (1.570mg/L; IQR, 1.2952.670), p < 0.001. In our study, the impact of SNPs which are correlated with a high level of efavirenz plasma concentrations was found. The genetic configuration of SNPs which are associated with high plasma efavirenz levels may be useful in optimizing the efavirenz dose that is used in HIV-1 infected patients. © 2013 by the Japanese Society for the Study of Xenobiotics (JSSX).";http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S134743671530433X;4.2;4.3;3.8;13474367;;;

Here, we review the integrase (IN) inhibitors from the discovery of the first compounds 20 years ago to the approval of two highly effective IN strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), raltegravir (Isentress) and elvitegravir (Stribild), and the promising clinical activity of dolutegravir. After summarizing the molecular mechanism of action of the INSTIs as interfacial inhibitors, we discuss the remaining challenges. Those include: overcoming resistance to clinical INSTIs, long-term safety of INSTIs, cost of therapy, place of the INSTIs in prophylactic treatments, and the development of new classes of inhibitors (the LEDGINs) targeting IN outside its catalytic site. We also discuss the role of chromatin and host DNA repair factor for the completion of integration. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780124058804000032;6.7;6.6;7.4;10543589;;;

This decline supports the hypothesis that antiretroviral therapy can arrest replication and prevent the evolution of resistance. Further support comes from excellent clinical outcomes, the failure of treatment intensification to reduce residual viremia, the lack of viral evolution in patients on optimal therapy, pharmacodynamics studies explaining the extraordinarily high antiviral activity of modern regimens, and recent reports of potential cures. Evidence supporting ongoing replication includes higher rates of certain complications in treated patients and an increase in circular forms of the viral genome after intensification with integrase inhibitors. Recent studies also provide an explanation for the observation that some patients fail protease-inhibitor based regimens without evidence for resistance.© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The THRIVE and ECHO studies are multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy of rilpivirine once daily versus efavirenz once daily in initial antiretroviral regimen for treatment-naive patients. At week 48 of treatment, rilpivirine was noninferior to efavirenz by the intention-to-treat time-to-loss-of-virologic-response. Of note, patients treated with rilpivirine had a higher rate of virologic failure whereas those treated with efavirenz had a higher rate of adverse events-associated discontinuation. The lower response among patients on rilpivirine compared with efavirenz was observed when pretreated plasma viral load was >100,000 copies/ml. Rilpivirine improved tolerability versus efavirenz particularly for dizziness, abnormal dream, rash and dyslipidemia. Patients with rilpivirine-associated mutations had a likelihood for reduced susceptibility to other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, especially etravirine, in subsequent antiretroviral regimens. Rilpivirine is contraindicated for use with proton-pump inhibitors. © 2013 Future Medicine Ltd.;https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/10.2217/fvl.12.135;1.5;1.4;1.0;17460794;;;

The best characterized reservoir is a small, difficult-to-quantify pool of resting memory CD4+ T cells carrying latent but replication-competent viral genomes. Because strategies targeting this latent reservoir are now being tested in clinical trials, well-validated high-throughput assays that quantify this reservoir are urgently needed. Here we compare eleven different approaches for quantitating persistent HIV-1 in 30 patients on HAART, using the original viral outgrowth assay for resting CD4+ T cells carrying inducible, replication-competent viral genomes as a standard for comparison. PCR-based assays for cells containing HIV-1 DNA gave infected cell frequencies at least 2 logs higher than the viral outgrowth assay, even in subjects who started HAART during acute/early infection. This difference may reflect defective viral genomes. The ratio of infected cell frequencies determined by viral outgrowth and PCR-based assays varied dramatically between patients. Although strong correlations with the viral outgrowth assay could not be formally excluded for most assays, correlations achieved statistical significance only for integrated HIV-1 DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and HIV-1 RNA/DNA ratio in rectal CD4+ T cells. Residual viremia was below the limit of detection in many subjects and did not correlate with the viral outgrowth assays. The dramatic differences in infected cell frequencies and the lack of a precise correlation between culture and PCR-based assays raise the possibility that the successful clearance of latently infected cells may be masked by a larger and variable pool of cells with defective proviruses. These defective proviruses are detected by PCR but may not be affected by reactivation strategies and may not require eradication to accomplish an effective cure. A molecular understanding of the discrepancy between infected cell frequencies measured by viral outgrowth versus PCR assays is an urgent priority in HIV-1 cure research. © 2013 Eriksson et al.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003174;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;e1003174;;

We conducted a cross-sectional study of 72 patients with suspected therapeutic failure. HIV-1 genotyping was performed with Viroseq HIV-1 Genotyping System v2.0 or the procedure developed by the ANRS AC11 resistance study group, and a phylogenetic analysis was performed. The median follow-up visit was at 40 (range, 12 to 123) months, and the median viral load was 4.67 (range, 3.13 to 6.94) log10 copies/ml. The first-line therapeutic regimen was nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus efavirenz (EFV) or NRTIs plus nevirapine (NVP) (54/72 patients; 75%), and the second-line therapy was NRTIs plus a protease inhibitor (PI/r) (18/72; 25%). Fifty-five patients (55/72; 76.39%) had at least one drug resistance mutation. The drug resistance rates were 72.22 and 88.89% for the first-line and second-line ARTs, respectively. In NRTI mutations, thymidine analog mutations (TAMs) were found in 50.79% and the M184V mutation was found in 34.92% of the samples. For non-NRTI resistance, we noted a predominance of the K103N mutation (46.27%). For PI/r, several cases of mutations were found with a predominance of M46I and L76V/F at 24% each. The phylogenetic analysis revealed CRF02 AG as the predominant circulating recombinant form (43/72; 59.72%). We found a high prevalence of resistance mutations and a high rate of TAMs among Senegalese patients in the public health system. These findings emphasize the need to improve virological monitoring in resource-limited settings.

The recommended dose is a 25 mg tablet once daily taken orally with a meal. Due to cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme induction or gastric pH increase, rilpivirine cannot be coadministered with a number of other drugs (anticonvulsants, rifabutin, rifampicin, rifapentine, proton pump inhibitors, systemic dexamethasone and St John's wort). Rilpivirine should be used with caution when coadministered with a drug with a known risk for torsade de pointes. Rilpivirine has a better tolerability than a comparative NNRTI, efavirenz, in clinical trials, with fewer central nervous system adverse effects, rashes, lipid abnormalities and discontinuation rates. Virological failure occurs more commonly with higher baseline viral loads (>100 000 copies/mL) and lower baseline CD4 counts (<50cells/mm. 3). Seventeen NNRTI mutations have been associated with decreased susceptibility to rilpivirine: K101E/P, E138A/G/K/Q/R, V179L, Y181C/I/V, H221Y, F227C, M230I/L, Y188L and the combination L100I + K103N. Resistance to rilpivirine largely excludes future use of the NNRTI class. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.

However, long term data are limited. India has the third largest HIV infected population in the world but the long-term outcome of first line therapy according to the national guidelines has not been evaluated yet. Therefore, we conducted a long-term longitudinal analysis of the efficacy of the national first-line therapy in India from an observational cohort of Indian patients in two different clinical settings. Methodology/Principal Findings: A total 323 patients who had been on ART for a median of 23 months and achieved virological suppression <100 copies/ml by their study baseline visit, were included and followed for two years. Blood samples were collected every six months for viral load and CD4 count. Drug resistance genotyping was performed when the viral load was >2000 copies/mL. Adherence and treatment interruptions (>48 h) were assessed via self-report. In the studied patients, the median duration of viral suppression was 44 months; 15.8% of patients showed viral rebound, and 2.8% viral failure. Viral rebound or failure was significantly negatively related to perfect adherence (100% adherence and no treatment interruption >48 hrs). Virological re-suppression in the subsequent visit was observed in three patients without any change in therapy despite the presence of key mutations. Conclusion/Significance: Our study reports for the first time, a good long-term response to the first line therapy for a median of nearly four years although a less than perfect adherence increases the risk for treatment failure and subsequent drug resistance development. The empirical findings in this study also indicate the overall success of the Indian ART program in two different settings which likely are representative of other clinics that operate under the national guidelines. © 2013 Neogi et al.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0055421;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e55421;;

We retrospectively conducted genotypic analysis on archived samples from Nigerian patients who received targeted viral load testing to confirm treatment failure and report their drug resistance mutation patterns. METHODS: Stored plasma from 349 adult patients on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) regimens was assayed for HIV-1 RNA viral load, and samples with more than 1000copies/ml were sequenced in the pol gene. Analysis for resistance mutations utilized the IAS-US 2011 Drug Resistance Mutation list. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-five samples were genotyped; the majority of the subtypes were G (42.9%) and CRF02-AG (33.7%). Patients were on ART for a median of 27 months. 90% had the M184V/I mutation, 62% had at least one thymidine analog mutation, and 14% had the K65R mutation. 97% had an NNRTI resistance mutation and 47% had at least two etravirine-associated mutations. In multivariate analysis tenofovir-based regimens were less likely to have at least three nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutations after adjusting for subtype, previous ART, CD4, and HIV viral load [P<0.001, odds ratio (OR) 0.04]. 70% of patients on tenofovir-based regimens had at least two susceptible NRTIs to include in a second-line regimen compared with 40% on zidovudine-based regimens (P=0.04, OR=3.4). CONCLUSIONS: At recognition of treatment failure, patients on tenofovir-based first-line regimens had fewer NRTI drug-resistant mutations and more active NRTI drugs available for second-line regimens. These findings can inform strategies for ART regimen sequencing to optimize long-term HIV treatment outcomes in low-resource settings. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.";http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201302200-00007;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

The meeting was held in New York, NY, USA and brought together NIMH-funded investigators who are currently working on projects related to the neurological complications of AIDS (NeuroAIDS) in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America in order to provide an opportunity to share their recent findings and discuss the challenges encountered within each country. The major goals of the roundtable were to evaluate HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment and determine if it may be directly attributable to distinct HIV subtypes or clades and to discuss the future priorities for global NeuroAIDS research. At the ""Global NeuroAIDS Roundtable"", presentations of preliminary research indicated that HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment is prevalent in all countries examined regardless of which HIV clade is present in the region. The only clear-cut difference between HIV-1 clades was in relation to subtypes A and D in Uganda. However, a key point that emerged from the discussions was that there is an urgent need to standardize neurocognitive assessment methodologies across the globe before definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the relationship between HIV clade diversity and neuropathogenesis. Future research directions were also discussed at the roundtable with particular emphasis on the potential of viral and host factor molecular interactions to impact the pathophysiology of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) from a global perspective. © 2013 Journal of NeuroVirology, Inc.

We hypothesize that proliferation of HIV-1-infected cells contributes to persistence of HIV-1 infection during suppressive ART. This predicts that identical or monotypic HIV-1 DNA sequences will increase over time during ART. We analyzed 1,656 env and pol sequences generated following single-genome amplification from the blood and sputum of six individuals during long-term suppressive ART. The median proportion of monotypic sequences increased from 25.0% prior to ART to 43.2% after a median of 9.8 years of suppressive ART. The proportion of monotypic sequences was estimated to increase 3.3% per year (95% confidence interval, 2.3 to 4.4%; P<0.001). Drug resistance mutations were not more common in the monotypic sequences, arguing against viral replication during times with lower antiretroviral concentrations. Bioinformatic analysis found equivalent genetic distances of monotypic and nonmonotypic sequences from the predicted founder virus sequence, suggesting that the relative increase in monotypic variants over time is not due to selective survival of cells with viruses from the time of acute infection or from just prior to ART initiation. Furthermore, while the total HIV-1 DNA load decreased during ART, the calculated concentration of monotypic sequences was stable in children, despite growth over nearly a decade of observation, consistent with proliferation of infected CD4+ T cells and slower decay of monotypic sequences. Our findings suggest that proliferation of cells with proviruses is a likely mechanism of HIV-1 DNA persistence, which should be considered when designing strategies to eradicate HIV-1 infection. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.";https://jvi.asm.org/content/87/3/1770;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;

Collected data was analysed using EpiInfo™ version 6.04. One hundred patients were included, with an average follow-up duration of 27 months and 19 days (± 21 months and 14 days).We observed an average increase in body weight of about 8 kg per annum, with an average rise in CD4 count of 100/mm3 by the end of the second year. A reduction in viral load with 71% of patients in therapeutic success at 24 month of treatment was noted.

These simple adherence measures are inexpensive and easy to administer; however, require validation and adjustment prior to implementation. The objective of this study was to define the optimal adherence assessment measure in Namibia to identify patients at risk for sub-optimal adherence and poor virologic response 6 months after ART initiation. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in HIV-infected adults receiving ART for 6-12 months prior to the adherence assessment. Adherence measures included 30-day VAS, 30-day Likert item, self-reported treatment interruptions, PIT, and MPR. Association of adherence measures with 6-month HIV-1 RNA level was assessed using two thresholds (1000 copies/mL and 5000 copies/mL). Adherence was assessed in 236 patients, mean age 37.3 years, 54% female. Mean adherence was 98.1% by 30-day VAS, 84.7% by 30-day Likert item, 97.0% by self-reported treatment interruptions, 90.6% by PIT, and 98.8% by MPR. Agreement between adherence measures was poor using kappa statistic. 76% had HIV-1 RNA <1000 copies/ml, and 88% had HIV-1 RNA <5000 copies/ml. MPR (continuous) was associated with viral suppression <5000 copies/ml (p = 0.036). MPR <75% was associated with virologic failure at 5000 copies/ml with OR 3.89 (1.24, 12.21), p = 0.013. Adherence was high with all measures. Only MPR, was associated with short-term virologic response, suggesting its cross-culturally utility for early identification of patients at high risk for virologic failure. © 2013 Hong et al.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0056307;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e56307;;

Methods: Women were eligible for the study if they had detectable PVL (defined as two consecutive samples with PVL>1000 copies/mL) and intended to change their current HAART regimen at the time of enrollment. Paired plasma and GT HIV-1 RNA were measured prospectively over 3 years. Longitudinal analyses examined rates of GT HIV-1 RNA shedding and the association with PVL. Results: Sixteen women were followed for a median of 11 visits contributing a total of 205 study visits. At study enrollment, all had detectable PVL and 69% had detectable GT HIV-1 RNA. Half of the women changed to a new HAART regimen with 3 active antiretroviral drugs. The probability of having detectable PVL 30 days after changing HAART was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37 to 0.74). Fourteen women (88%) had detectable PVL on a follow-up visit 30 or 60 days after changing HAART; and 12 women (75%) had detectable GT HIV-1 RNA on a follow-up visit 30 or 60 days after changing HAART. When PVL was undetectable, GT shedding occurred at 11% of visits, and when PVL was detectable, GT shedding occurred at 47% of visits. Conclusions: Some treatment-experienced HIV-infected women continue to have detectable virus in both the plasma and GT following a change in HAART, highlighting the difficulty of viral suppression in this patient population. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.";http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/jwh.2012.3849;4.0;3.6;3.5;15409996;;;

However, some infected monkeys presented with an immunosuppressive syndrome resembling that induced by simian immunodeficiency virus infection. Antiretrovirals with inhibitory activity against SRV-4 are considered to be promising agents to combat SRV-4 infection. However, although some antiretrovirals have been reported to have inhibitory activity against SRV-1 and SRV-2, inhibitors with anti-SRV-4 activity have not yet been studied. In this study, we identified antiretroviral agents with anti-SRV-4 activity from a panel of anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drugs using a robust in vitro luciferase reporter assay. Among these, two HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, zidovudine (AZT) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), potently inhibited SRV-4 infection within a submicromolar to nanomolar range, which was similar to or higher than the activities against HIV-1, Moloney murine leukemia virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus. In contrast, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors did not exhibit any activities against SRV-4. Although both AZT and TDF effectively inhibited cell-free SRV-4 transmission, they exhibited only partial inhibitory activities against cell-to-cell transmission. Importantly, one HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitor, raltegravir (RAL), potently inhibited single-round infection as well as cell-free and cell-to-cell SRV-4 transmission. These findings indicate that viral expansion routes impact the inhibitory activity of antiretrovirals against SRV-4, while only RAL is effective in suppressing both the initial SRV-4 infection and subsequent SRV-4 replication. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/87/8/4322;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;

Methods: A total of 21 801 patients from 18 cohorts in Europe and North America starting ART on regimens including at least two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and boosted protease inhibitor or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor during 2002-2009 were included. Incidence of modifications (change of drug class, substitution/addition within class, or switch to nonstandard regimen), interruption or death and associations with patient characteristics were estimated using competing-risks methods. Results: During median 28 months follow-up, 8786 (40.3%) patients modified first ART, 2346 (10.8%) interrupted and 427 (2.0%) died before changing regimen. Threeyear cumulative percentages of modification, interruption and death were 47, 12 and 2%, respectively. After adjustment, rates of interruption were highest for IDUs and lowest for MSM, and higher for patients starting ART with CD4 cell count above 350 cells/ml than other patients. Compared to efavirenz, patients on lopinavir and other protease inhibitors had higher rates of modification and interruption, on atazanavir had lower rates of class change, and on nevirapine higher rates of interruption. Those on tenofovir/emtricitabine backbone had lowest rates of substitutions and switches to nonstandard regimen, and on abacavir/lamivudine lowest rates of interruption. Rates of substitution and switches to nonstandard regimen were lower in 2006-2009. Conclusion: Rates of modification and interruption were high, particularly in the first year of ART. Decreased rates of substitutions or switches to nonstandard regimen in recent years may be linked to greater use of well tolerated once-daily drugs. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health.;http://journals.lww.com/00002030-900000000-98733;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

Methods: An observational cohort study was performed on 210 patients (including 39 children) who initiated PI-based second-line therapy at least 12 months prior to data collection. Biannual clinical, immunological and virological monitoring was performed. Primary endpoints were adequate virological response (plasma HIV-1 RNA<400 copies/ml), full virological suppression (plasma HIV-1 RNA<50 copies/ml) and treatment failure (virological failure (plasma HIV-1 RNA>1000 after initial virological response) or on-going viremia (plasma HIV-1 RNA never<400 copies/ml for more than six months)). Data were analyzed by an on-treatment (OT) and intention-to-treat (ITT) approach. Analyses were primarily performed on the group of patients who switched following first-line virological failure. Results: Median duration of follow-up after switch to second-line treatment was 20 months [IQR 11-35]. 191 patients had switched to second-line ART due to first-line virological failure. 139/191 of them (72.8%, ITT) were in care and on treatment at the end of follow-up and 11/191 (5.8%, ITT) had died. After twelve months, an adequate virological response was seen in 92/128 patients (71.9%, OT), of which 78/128 (60.9%, OT) experienced full virological suppression. Virological response remained stable after 24 months. Virological efficacy was similar amongst adult and pediatric patients. As in first-line ART, we observed a lack of correlation between virological failure and WHO-defined immunological failure. Conclusions: Good virological outcomes following first-line failure can be achieved with PI-based, second-line antiretroviral therapy in both adult and pediatric patients in rural South Africa. Retention rates were high and virological outcomes were sustainable during the two-year follow-up period, although persisting low-level viremia occurred in a subset of patients. The observed viro-immunological dissociation emphasizes the need for virological monitoring. © 2013 Schoffelen et al.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058526;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e58526;;

Materials and methods: Multi-dimensional Bayesian network classifiers (MBCs) are probabilistic graphical models especially designed to solve multi-dimensional classification problems, where each input instance in the data set has to be assigned simultaneously to multiple output class variables that are not necessarily binary. In this paper, we introduce a new method, named MB-MBC, for learning MBCs from data by determining the Markov blanket around each class variable using the HITON algorithm. Our method is applied to both reverse transcriptase and protease data sets obtained from the Stanford HIV-1 database. Results: Regarding the prediction of antiretroviral combination therapies, the experimental study shows promising results in terms of classification accuracy compared with state-of-the-art MBC learning algorithms. For reverse transcriptase inhibitors, we get 71% and 11% in mean and global accuracy, respectively; while for protease inhibitors, we get more than 84% and 31% in mean and global accuracy, respectively. In addition, the analysis of MBC graphical structures lets us gain insight into both known and novel interactions between reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors and their respective resistance mutations. Conclusion: MB-MBC algorithm is a valuable tool to analyze the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors prediction problem and to discover interactions within and between these two classes of inhibitors. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0933365712001534;4.9;6.2;6.9;09333657;;;

We retrospectively studied virus-transmission patterns of these subtypes in comparison to the longer-established subtype B, evaluating in particular risk-group related differences. We also examined to what extent distinct drug-resistance patterns in subtypes A/AE versus B reflected differences in patient behavior and drug-treatment history. Methods: Reverse-transcriptase (RT) and protease sequences were retrospectively analyzed along with clinical and epidemiological data. MEGA, ClusalX, and Beast programs were used in a phylogenetic analysis to identify transmission networks. Results: 318 drug-naive individuals with A/AE or patients failing combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) were identified. 61% were IVDU. Compared to infected homosexuals, IVDU transmitted HIV infrequently and, typically, only to a single partner. 6.8% of drug-naive patients had drug resistance. Treatment-failing, regimen-stratified subtype-A/AE- and B-patients differed from each other significantly in the frequencies of the major resistance-conferring mutations T215FY, K219QE and several secondary mutations. Notably, failing boosted protease-inhibitors (PI) treatment was not significantly associated with protease or RT mutations in either subtype. Conclusions: While sizable transmission networks occur in infected homosexuals, continued HIV transmission among IVDU in Israel is largely sporadic and the rate is relatively modest, as is that of drug-resistance transmission. Deviation of drug-naive A/AE sequences from subtype-B consensus sequence, documented here, may subtly affect drug-resistance pathways. Conspicuous differences in overall drug-resistance that are manifest before regimen stratification can be largely explained in terms of treatment history, by the different efficacy/adherence limitations of older versus newer regimens. The phenomenon of treatment failure in boosted-PI-including regimens in the apparent absence of drug-resistance to any of the drugs, and its relation to adherence, require further investigation. © 2013 Avidor et al.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0057789;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e57789;;

The first integrase inhibitor, raltegravir, was made available in 2007. Recently, phase 3 studies of two new compounds - elvitegravir which needs pharmacological boosting with either ritonavir or cobicistat, and dolutegravir - have been presented, showing high virologic success rates, over 48-96 weeks, both in first-line antiretroviral therapy and in the treatment of experienced patients. The clinical tolerance of the three inhibitors is good, and they have globally a good safety profile. Dolutegravir and cobicistat exerts a blockade of the renal tubular secretion of creatinine, leading to a decrease in estimated creatinine clearance, which does not reflect renal toxicity, i.e. decrease in glomerular filtration. Both dolutegravir and elvitegravir (within the fixed dose combination of TDF/FTC/elvitegravir/cobicistat) should be available in clinical practice soon, which will offer more options for the strategic use of integrase inhibitors to treat both HIV-1 and possibly HIV-2 infections.;None;0.2;0.3;0.2;12678694;;;

This review focuses on recent advances in the development of small molecule long-acting injectable ARV agents. RECENT FINDINGS: The need for combination ART and physicochemical and dosing limitations of current ARV drugs impede attempts to redevelop them as long-acting injectable formulations. However, the intrinsic properties of rilpivirine, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and GSK1265744, an HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor, have enabled crystalline nanoparticle formulations to progress to clinical trials. SUMMARY: Investigational long-acting injectable nanoformulations of rilpivirine and GSK1265744 are clinical-stage development candidates. Complementary pharmacologic properties of both agents - different mechanisms of action, resistance profiles, metabolic pathways, lack of drug interactions and low daily oral doses - offer the potential for combination use. Phase I studies of the pharmacokinetics and safety of each long-acting formulation alone and in combination indicate that a monthly dosing regimen is possible for HIV treatment. An ongoing phase IIb trial of oral GSK1265744 and oral rilpivirine is evaluating this two-drug regimen for maintenance of virologic suppression; results will inform future studies using the injectable formulations. Additional preclinical and clinical studies indicate a potential use of each agent for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health.";http://journals.lww.com/01222929-201311000-00008;7.5;7.2;7.8;1746630X;;;

Methods A 96-week multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel group pilot study was conducted. The endpoints were times to virologic failure, safety event and regimen modification. Results 109 patients were enrolled and randomly allocated (54 patients received ABC/3TC and 55 patients received TDF/FTC). All randomized subjects were analyzed. The time to virologic failure was not significantly different between the two arms by 96 weeks (HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 0.72-6.13; p=0.178). Both regimens showed favorable viral efficacy, as in the intention-to-treat population, 72.2% (ABC/3TC) and 78.2% (TDF/ FTC) of the patients had an HIV-1 viral load <50 copies/mL at 96 weeks. The time to the first grade 3 or 4 adverse event and the time to the first regimen modification were not significantly different between the two arms (adverse event: HR 0.66; 95% CI, 0.25-1.75, p=0.407) (regimen modification: HR 1.03; 95% CI, 0.33- 3.19, p=0.964). Both regimens were also well-tolerated, as only 11.1% (ABC/3TC) and 10.9% (TDF/FTC) of the patients discontinued the allocated regimen by 96 weeks. Clinically suspected abacavir-associated hypersensitivity reactions occurred in only one (1.9%) patient in the ABC/3TC arm. Conclusion Although insufficiently powered to show non-inferiority of viral efficacy of ABC/3TC relative to TDF/FTC, this pilot trial suggested that ABC/3TC with ATV/r is a safe and efficacious initial regimen for HLA-B*5701-negative patients, such as the Japanese population. © 2013 The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.";http://jlc.jst.go.jp/DN/JST.JSTAGE/internalmedicine/52.9155?lang=en&from=CrossRef&type=abstract;1.4;1.4;1.6;09182918;;;

In the screening population, the prevalence of 49 NNRTI resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) and the impact of allowed NNRTI RAMs on virological response to an RPV- or efavirenz (EFV)-containing regimen were analysed. Methods: ECHO and THRIVE were global, Phase III, doubleblind, double-dummy, randomized trials in antiretroviral treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected adults to determine whether RPV 25 mg once daily had non-inferior eficacy versus EFV 600 mg once daily, both given with tenofovir/ emtricitabine (ECHO) or tenofovir/emtricitabine, zidovudine/ lamivudine or abacavir/lamivudine (THRIVE). The prevalence of 49 NNRTI RAMs, including the predeined list of 39 NNRTI RAMs used to exclude patients with potential resistance to RPV or EFV, was investigated at screening by population sequencing (including mixtures) using the vircoTYPE HIV-1 genotyping assay. Results: Of the 1,796 screened patients in whom genotypic resistance results were available, 372 (21%) had NNRTI RAMs. Of 527 screening failures, 148 (28%) were due to the presence of NNRTI RAMs. The presence of allowed NNRTI RAMs was associated with comparable response rates to the overall population (RPV 84.3% versus EFV 82.3%, intent-to-treat time-to-loss-of- virological- response): V90I (82.4% and 100% for RPV and EFV, respectively), V106I (85.7% and 93.3%), V179I (87.7% and 94.0%) and V189I (100.0% and 88.9%). Conclusions: Analysis of the ECHO and THRIVE screened population suggests that transmitted NNRTI resistance is prevalent in treatment-naive patients but prevalence of the 15 RPV RAMs remains low. The four allowed NNRTI RAMs present at baseline did not affect RPV response at week 48. © 2013 International Medical Press.;http://www.intmedpress.com/journals/avt/abstract.cfm?id=2358&pid=48;4.4;4.1;3.9;13596535;;;

Fixed-dose combination antiretroviral therapy provides adequate suppression of HIV-1 replication, provides barrier to the development of resistance, simpliies dosage regimen and improves adherence. Methods: An open label, randomized, two-way crossover study was conducted on 24 healthy adults under fasted conditions, with a washout period of 14 days between treatments. A total of 15 blood samples were collected before dosing and up to 96 h post dosing. The drugs were extracted from plasma and analysed using a validated high performance liquid chromatography - ultraviolet method. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis was performed to obtain the PK parameters, maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), area under curve of plasma concentration- time curves from time zero to last measurable concentration (AUC0-t) and area under curve extrapolated to ininity (AUC0-8). ANOVA test was performed to determine the effect of model factors on the PK parameters. The two one-sided t-tests were performed on the log-transformed data to determine the 90% CI for the ratio of test to reference PK parameters. Results: The drugs were well tolerated and safe, with minimal adverse events. The ANOVA test indicated the absence of any signiicant effects (P>0.05) due to the model parameters. The 90% CI for the geometric mean ratio of test/ reference for Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-8 for lamivudine, zidovudine and nevirapine were within the 80-125% bioequivalence limits. Conclusions: This single-dose randomized study found that the test and reference products met the criteria for bioequivalence in the fasting healthy adult volunteers. © 2013 International Medical Press.;http://www.intmedpress.com/journals/avt/abstract.cfm?id=2310&pid=48;4.4;4.1;3.9;13596535;;;

HIV genotype resistance assays predict drug resistance on the basis of mutations in the viral genome. However, their clinical utility, especially in a resource limited setting is still a subject of debate. The authors report two cases in which both the children suffered from treatment failure of various antiretroviral therapy regimes. In both the cases, Genotype Resistance Testing (GRT) prompted a radical change from proposed failure therapy as per existing guidelines. GRT was specifically important for the selection of a new dual Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) component of failure regimen by identifying TAMS and M184V mutations in the HIV genome. These case reports highlight the importance of GRT in children failing multiple antiretroviral regimes; and emphasizes the need to recognize situations where GRT is absolutely essential to guide appropriate therapy, even in a resource limited setting. © 2012 Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12098-012-0752-6;1.8;2.0;2.3;00195456;;;

HIV-infected patients aged <19 years undergoing DRT for virological failure were retrospectively enrolled. Indications for DRT and changes in HIV RNA load were recorded. Between January 2000 and December 2006, 57 patients had DRT. The most common indication for DRT was poor ART adherence (57.7% of patients). ART was changed in 50.9% of patients after DRT. Poor adherence was cited by clinicians for not changing ART significantly more often than any other reason (47.3%, P < 0.001). After DRT, significant improvement in HIV RNA load occurred independent of ART changes, though patients whose ART was modified were more likely to become undetectable (31.5% versus 7.0%, P < 0.001). Poor adherence was a significant factor for ordering DRT and for not changing ART in HIV-infected children. © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956462412473958;2.5;2.5;2.7;09564624;;;

Especially, multidrug-resistant viruses pose a threat to efficient therapy. We studied the changing prevalence of multidrug resistance (MDR) over time in a cohort of HIV-1-infected patients in Portugal. Patients and methods: We used data of 8065 HIV-1-infected patients followed from July 2001 up to April 2012 in 22 hospitals located in Portugal. MDR at a specific date of sampling was defined as no more than one fully active drug (excluding integrase and entry inhibitors) at that time authorized by the Portuguese National Authority of Medicines and Health Products (INFARMED), as interpreted with the Rega algorithm version 8.0.2. A generalized linear mixed model was used to study the time trend of the prevalence of MDR. Results: We observed a statistically significant decrease in the prevalence of MDR over the last decade, from 6.9% (95% CI: 5.7-8.4) in 2001-03, 6.0% (95% CI: 4.9-7.2) in 2003-05, 3.7% (95% CI: 2.8-4.8) in 2005-07 and 1.6% (95% CI: 1.1-2.2) in 2007-09 down to 0.6% (95% CI: 0.3-0.9) in 2009-12 [OR=0.80 (95% CI: 0.75-0.86); P<0.001]. In July 2011 the last new case of MDR was seen. Conclusions: The prevalence of multidrug-resistant HIV-1 is decreasing over time in Portugal, reflecting the increasing efficiency of HAART and the availability of new drugs. Therefore, in designing a new drug, safety and practical aspects, e.g. less toxicity and ease of use, may need more attention than focusing mainly on efficacy against resistant strains. © The Author 2012.

Although many RT inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, they all target the polymerase function of this enzyme. So far, no drugs are available for the inhibition of the RT associated ribonuclease H function (RNase H), which plays an essential role in the HIV replication cycle. Moreover it should be reported that many of the known RT inhibitors, targeting the polymerase function, enhance the RNase H activity, indicating that, although spatially distinct, a close relation occurs between the two functions. The aim of this review is to summarise the efforts in the design of new inhibitors either characterized by a novel mechanism of action or capable of blocking both RT associated functions, as well as pointing out the main binding features of the known RT inhibitors. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.;http://www.eurekaselect.com/openurl/content.php?genre=article&issn=1381-6128&volume=19&issue=10&spage=1850;5.8;5.3;5.1;13816128;;;

This study aimed at investigating the ability of the latest Rega algorithm to predict virological response on a short and longer period.Materials & Methods:9231 treatment changes episodes were extracted from an integrated patient database. The virological response after 8, 24 and 48 weeks was dichotomized to success and failure. Success was defined as a viral load below 50 copies/ml or alternatively, a 2 log decrease from the baseline viral load at 8 weeks. The predictive ability of Rega version 8 was analysed in comparison with that of previous evaluated version Rega 5 and two other algorithms (ANRS v2011.05 and Stanford HIVdb v6.0.11). A logistic model based on the genotypic susceptibility score was used to predict virological response, and additionally, confounding factors were added to the model. Performance of the models was compared using the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.Results:Per unit increase of the GSS reported by Rega 8, the odds on having a successful therapy response on week 8 increased significantly by 81% (OR = 1.81, CI = [1.76-1.86]), on week 24 by 73% (OR = 1.73, CI = [1.69-1.78]) and on week 48 by 85% (OR = 1.85, CI = [1.80-1.91]). No significant differences in AUC were found between the performance of Rega 8 and Rega 5, ANRS v2011.05 and Stanford HIVdb v6.0.11, however Rega 8 had the highest sensitivity: 76.9%, 76.5% and 77.2% on 8, 24 and 48 weeks respectively. Inclusion of additional factors increased the performance significantly.Conclusion:Rega 8 is a significant predictor for virological response with a better sensitivity than previously, and with rules for recently approved drugs. Additional variables should be taken into account to ensure an effective regimen. © 2013 Vercauteren et al.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0061436;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e61436;;

Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) dramatically reduces human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. However, isolated shedding of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) in semen (IHS) can occur in the absence of detectable viremia or genital infections. We hypothesized that ART intensification with medications active in semen might prevent IHS.Methods. Paired blood and semen samples were collected monthly for 6 months from HIV-infected men starting ART that was intensified (iART) with maraviroc and raltegravir in an open-label fashion. Semen parameters were compared to those of historical controls starting standard ART (sART).Results. Compared with 25 controls who started sART, the semen HIV-1 load in 13 subjects who started iART was more rapidly suppressed (P =. 043). IHS was detected at >1 visit in 2 participants (15%) receiving iART and in 12 controls (48%) receiving sART (P =. 040). Among iART recipients, IHS was associated with lower raltegravir concentrations in blood and semen, compared with complete HIV-1 suppression (P =. 03). Prolonged, high-level IHS (ie, shedding of >5000 RNA copies/mL) was observed in 1 iART recipient (8%), despite rapid viremia suppression and therapeutic drug levels; for 10 months, this virus remained R5 tropic, drug susceptible, and similar in sequence to virus recovered from blood. IHS was not seen after >3 years of effective ART in a parallel, prospective cohort study.Conclusions. iART transiently reduced the occurrence of IHS early after ART initiation but did not prevent high-level IHS. IHS was not seen after more prolonged sART. © 2013 The Author.";https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/infdis/jit026;10.4;9.2;9.0;00221899;;;

We previously developed an algorithm combining a clinical predictor score (CPS) with targeted VL testing in a Cambodian patient population (derivation population). We now prospectively validate the algorithm in the same clinical setting (validation population), assess its operational performance, and explore its cost-saving potential. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study in a tertiary hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, applying the CPS in adults on first-line antiretroviral treatment for at least 1 year. Treatment failure was defined as a VL .1000 copies per milliliter. The area under the receiveroperating characteristic (AUROC) curve of the CPS to detect treatment failure in the current study population (validation population) was compared with the AUROC of the CPS obtained in the patient population where the CPS was derived from in 2008 in the same study setting (derivation population). Costs related to VL testing and secondline regimens with the different testing strategies were compared. Results: One thousand four hundred ninety individuals {56.6% female, median age 38 years [interquartile range (IQR): 33-44]} were included, with a median baseline CD4 cell count of 94 cells per microliter (IQR: 28-205). Median time on antiretroviral treatment was 3.6 years (IQR: 2.1-5.1), 45 (3.0%) individuals had treatment failure. The AUROC of the CPS in validation was 0.75 (95% confidence interval: 0.67 to 0.83), relative to an AUROC of 0.70 in the derivation population. At the CPS cutoff $2, VL was indicated for 164 (11%) individuals, preventing inappropriate switching to second line in 143 cases. Twenty-four cases of treatment failure would be missed. When applied in routine care, the AUROC was 0.69 (95% confidence interval: 0.60 to 0.77). Overall 1-year program costs with targeted VL testing were 4-fold reduced. Conclusions: The algorithm performed well in validation and has cost-saving potential. Further studies to assess its performance, feasibility, and impact in different settings are warranted.

The burden of Cryptococcus neoformans in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) predicts clinical outcomes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated cryptococcal meningitis (CM) and is lower in patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study tested the hypothesis that initiation of ART during initial treatment of HIV/CM would improve CSF clearance of C. neoformans.Methods. A randomized treatment-strategy trial was conducted in Botswana. HIV-infected, ART-naive adults aged 21 years initiating amphotericin B treatment for CM were randomized to ART initiation within 7 (intervention) vs after 28 days (control) of randomization, and the primary outcome of the rate of CSF clearance of C. neoformans over the subsequent 4 weeks was compared. Adverse events, including CM immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (CM-IRIS), and immunologic and virologic responses were compared over 24 weeks.Results. Among 27 subjects enrolled (14 control and 13 intervention), the median times to ART initiation were 7 (interquartile range [IQR], 5-10) and 32 days (IQR, 28-36), respectively. The estimated rate of CSF clearance did not differ significantly by treatment strategy (-0.32 log 10 colony-forming units [CFU]/mL/day ± 0.20 intervention and -0.52 log10 CFUs/mL/day (± 0.48) control, P =. 4). Two of 13 (15%) and 5 of 14 (36%) subjects died in the intervention and control arms, respectively (P = 0.39). Seven of 13 subjects (54%) in the intervention arm vs 0 of 14 in the control arm experienced CM-IRIS (P =. 002).Conclusions. Early ART was not associated with improved CSF fungal clearance, but resulted in a high risk of CM-IRIS. Further research on optimal incorporation of ART into CM care is needed.Clinical Trials Registration. NCT00976040. © 2013 The Author 2013.

Scientific efforts have led to the discovery of several effective drugs against HIV and lowered the morbidity and mortality all over the world. However, despite availability of a good number of anti-HIV drugs, the problem, for the foreseeable reasons, stands out as the most chronic disease due to the less tolerability and low accessibility of drugs, life-long expensive treatment, and above all, the emergence of drug resistant viral strains. This review dwells upon HIV infection and its proliferation inside the host system, drug targets, different types of drugs, their structural features and mode of interaction with viral targets and drug regimens. It further focuses on topics of latest interest regarding drug development, fixed dose combinations (FDCs), the limitations of present day drugs with their structural features along with their pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics and the challenges in finding a permanent cure for HIV/AIDS. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.;http://www.eurekaselect.com/openurl/content.php?genre=article&issn=1381-6128&volume=19&issue=10&spage=1767;5.8;5.3;5.1;13816128;;;

However, drug resistance has been a major factor contributing to antiretroviral therapy failure. Currently, there are 26 drugs approved for treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, although some of them are no longer prescribed. Most of the available antiretroviral drugs target HIV genome replication (i.e. reverse transcriptase inhibitors) and viral maturation (i.e. viral protease inhibitors). Other drugs in clinical use include a viral coreceptor antagonist (maraviroc), a fusion inhibitor (enfuvirtide) and two viral integrase inhibitors (raltegravir and elvitegravir). Elvitegravir and the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor rilpivirine have been the most recent additions to the antiretroviral drug armamentarium. An overview of the molecular mechanisms involved in antiretroviral drug resistance and the role of drug resistance-associated mutations was previously presented (Menéndez-Arias, L., 2010. Molecular basis of human immunodeficiency virus drug resistance: an update. Antiviral Res. 85, 210-231). This article provides now an updated review that covers currently approved drugs, new experimental agents (e.g. neutralizing antibodies) and selected drugs in preclinical or early clinical development (e.g. experimental integrase inhibitors). Special attention is dedicated to recent research on resistance to reverse transcriptase and integrase inhibitors. In addition, recently discovered interactions between HIV and host proteins and novel strategies to block HIV assembly or viral entry emerge as promising alternatives for the development of effective antiretroviral treatments. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166354213000223;7.4;7.3;7.4;01663542;;;

This paper provides a review of different multi-classifiers and some application of them. Also it is shown a novel model of combining classifiers and its application to predicting human immunodeficiency virus drug resistance from genotype. The proposal is based on the use of different classifier models. It clusters the dataset considering the performance of the base classifiers. The system learns how to decide from the groups, by using a meta-classifier, which are the best classifiers for a given pattern. The proposed model is compared with well-known classifier ensembles and individual classifiers as well resulting the novel model in similar or even better performance. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.;http://www.eurekaselect.com/openurl/content.php?genre=article&issn=1568-0266&volume=13&issue=5&spage=685;5.0;5.7;6.6;15680266;;;

Methods: The protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes were systematically sequenced in samples from 756 patients with VL>50 copies/mL in 2009. The genotyping results were interpreted for each antiretroviral drug (ARV) by using the ANRS algorithm v21. Weighted analyses were used to derive representative estimates of percentages of patients. Prevalence rates were compared with those obtained in 2004 among patients with VL .1000 copies/mL. Results: Sequences were obtained for 506 patients. Sequencing was successful in 45%, 80% and 96% of samples with VL of 51-500, 501-1000 and >1000 copies/mL, respectively. Resistance or possible resistance to at least one ARV was observed in 59% of samples. Overall, 0.9% of samples contained viruses resistant to all drugs belonging to at least three drug classes. All resistance prevalence rates were significantly lower in 2009 than in 2004. Conclusion: In France, where 86% of patients were receiving combination antiretroviral therapy in 2009, only 15.0% of patients had a VL>50 copies/mL, suggesting that only 8.9% of treated patients could potentially transmit resistant viruses. Only 0.08% of patients harboured viruses fully resistant to at least three antiretroviral drug classes.

When administered to HIV-infected subjects receiving suppressive ART, interleukin-7 (IL-7) increases the number of CD41 T cells by promoting their survival and proliferation. However, little is known about the impact of IL-7 on HIV persistence during ART. By isolating large numbers of CD41 T cells from HIV-infected subjects, we demonstrate that IL-7 enhances viral production in productively infected cells but does not disrupt viral latency in latently infected cells. When administered to virally suppressed subjects, IL-7 led to the rapid proliferation of memory CD41 T cells, which resulted in a 70% increase in the absolute number of circulating CD41 T cells harboring integrated HIV DNA 4 weeks after therapy. The genetic diversity of the viral reservoir increased transiently in the majority of the subjects studied before returning to baseline values. Altogether, our results indicate that IL-7 promotes the mechanisms of HIV persistence during ART by enhancing residual levels of viral production and inducing proliferation of latently infected cells, and suggest that IL-7 does not represent a suitable candidate therapeutic strategy for HIV eradication.

However, the physicochemical factors limiting the brain entry of a given ARV and the mutual interactions of combined drugs on their brain entry have not been properly characterized. Using transporter kinetic measurements, we show that large lipophilic drugs such as protease inhibitors (PI) have strong binding affinities to drug efflux transporters expressed at the BBB and thus are prevented from entering the brain. However, when combined, the PI with the highest binding affinity (i.e., boosting ritonavir) will occupy a large proportion of the transporter binding sites and thus slow down the efflux rate of the coadministered PI thereby facilitating its brain entry. Furthermore, using thermodynamic measurements and computational modeling, we show that ARV with small cross-sectional areas (AD < 70 Å2) and octanol-water distribution coefficients (-1 < log D <5) such as most nucleoside analogues have a high passive influx and cross the BBB despite interactions with drug transporters. These data indicate that HIV therapies combining small diffusing molecules with large lipophilic molecules are better suited for brain entry and should be preferred for HAND. This work highlights the role of PI as modulators of drugs' brain entry. © 2013 American Chemical Society.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/mp300712a;8.2;7.4;7.5;15438384;;;

The spectrum of diseases associated with HIV ranges from opportunistic infections and cancers to systemic physiological disorders like encephalopathy and neurocognitive impairment. A major progress in controlling HIV infection has been achieved by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). However, HAART does neither eliminate the virus reservoirs in form of latently infected cells nor does it completely reconstitute immune reactivity and physiological status. Furthermore, the failure of the STEP vaccine trial and the only marginal efficacies of the RV144 trial together suggest that the causal relationships between the complex sets of viral and immunological processes that contribute to protection or disease pathogenesis are still poorly understood. Here, we provide an up-to-date overview of HIV-host interactions at the cellular, the immune system and the neuroendocrine systems level. Only by integrating this multi-level knowledge one will be able to handle the systems complexity and develop new methodologies of analysis and prediction for a functional restoration of the immune system and the health of the infected host. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/08830185.2013.779375;6.0;6.1;7.0;08830185;;;

We studied a cohort of HIV-infected adults treated with ART for at least 1 year. Based on immunologic and virologic responses to ART, patients were categorized into four groups: CD4 T cell count 350 cells/mm3 and HIV-1 RNA level 400 copies/ml (group 1), CD4 T cell count 350 cells/mm3 and HIV-1 RNA level >400 copies/ml (group 2), CD4 T cell count <350 cells/mm3 and HIV-1 RNA level 400 copies/ml (group 3), and CD4 T cell count <350 cells/mm3 and HIV-1 RNA level >400 copies/ml (group 4). Time to incident TB for the four groups was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression models were used to evaluate predictors of incident TB. In this cohort of 5,093 HIV-infected adults, of which 68.4% were female, with a mean age 35.1 years (standard deviation 9.1 years), we observed 98 cases of incident TB during 4 years and 3 months of follow-up. The overall TB incidence rate was 8.7 cases/1,000 patient-years of follow-up. Adjusted hazards for incident TB were 2.11 (95% CI 0.97-4.61), 2.05 (95% CI 1.10-3.79), and 3.65 (95% CI 1.15-5.06) in group 2, 3, and 4 patients, respectively, compared to group 1. Tuberculosis incidence in patients on ART is driven by poor immunologic and/or virologic response. Optimization of HIV treatment should be prioritized to reduce the burden of TB in this high-risk population. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.;http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2012.0231;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

We aimed to examine whether first-line use of 2 NRTIs plus a boosted protease inhibitor (bPI) could protect against emergence of NRTI resistance mutations, compared to the use of 2 NRTIs plus 1 NNRTI.MethodsWe carried out a weighted meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials comparing bPI- with NNRTI-based first-line antiretroviral therapy regimens using random effects modeling.ResultsIn intention to treat analyses, there was no difference in the risk of viral failure at week 48 between NNRTI and bPI (P =. 19). At week 48, the overall difference between NNRTI- and PI-based regimens in selection of any major NRTI resistance mutation (crude unweighted prevalence 3.3% vs 1.6%) was 1.7% (95% confidence interval [CI],. 4-3.0; P =. 00927). There was a statistically significant difference in prevalence of K65R when comparing NNRTI (1.3%) with PI (0.67%); absolute weighted difference 1.0% (95% CI,. 3-1.7; P =. 00447). There was also a significant difference in prevalence of M184V/I between NNRTI and PI (crude unweighted prevalence 3.2% vs 1.4%); difference 1.6% (95% CI 0.1-3.1; P =. 0368).ConclusionsDespite the equivalent efficacy and more favorable resistance implications of PI- versus NNRTI-based first line therapy, widespread use of PI-based first-line therapy is not warranted at this time, due to resource limitations and predicted increased risk of resistance-related failure of NNRTI/NRTI second-line regimens. PI-based first-line therapy could be reconsidered when antiretroviral agents from other classes become available for second-line regimens in resource-limited settings. © The Author 2013.

Methods: From a nationwide population-based cohort study we identified all HIV-1-infected adults who initiated cART in Denmark 1997-2009 and were followed 1 year. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and reasons for treatment modifications were estimated and compared between patients, who initiated treatment in 1997-1999, 2000-2004 and 2005-2009. Rates of discontinuation of individual antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) were evaluated. Results: A total of 3,107 patients were followed for a median of 7.3 years (IQR 3.8-10.8). Rates of first treatment modification 1 year after cART initiation did not change (IRR 0.88 [95% CI 0.78, 1.01] and 1.03 [95% CI 0.90, 1.18] in 2000-2004 and 2005-2009, respectively, compared with 1997-1999).

Conclusions: Rates of first treatment modification 1 year after cART initiation have not changed since the early cART era, whereas the risk of multiple modifications has decreased markedly. Modifications due to virological failure and toxicity have decreased substantially, whereas rates of switch to simpler and less toxic regimens have increased. ©2013 International Medical Press.;http://www.intmedpress.com/journals/avt/abstract.cfm?id=2436&pid=48;4.4;4.1;3.9;13596535;;;

We investigated the associated changes in genotypic drug resistance patterns in patients with first-line ARV treatment failure since the introduction of these drugs, and protease inhibitor (PI) resistance patterns in patients who received ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r)-containing therapy.Methods:We analysed ARV treatment histories and HIV-1 RT and protease mutations in plasma samples submitted to the Tygerberg Academic Hospital National Health Service Laboratory.Results:Between 2006 and 2012, 1,667 plasma samples from 1,416 ARV-treated patients, including 588 children and infants, were submitted for genotypic resistance testing. Compared with 720 recipients of a d4T or AZT-containing first-line regimen, the 153 recipients of a TDF-containing first-line regimen were more likely to have the RT mutations K65R (46% vs 4.0%; p<0.001), Y115F (10% vs. 0.6%; p<0.001), L74VI (8.5% vs. 1.8%; p<0.001), and K70EGQ (7.8% vs. 0.4%) and recipients of an ABC-containing first-line regimen were more likely to have K65R (17% vs 4.0%; p<0.001), Y115F (30% vs 0.6%; p<0.001), and L74VI (56% vs 1.8%; p<0.001).

Low (20 patients) and intermediate (3 patients) darunavir (DRV) cross resistance was present in 23 (4.6%) patients.Conclusions:Among patients experiencing virological failure on a first-line regimen containing two NRTI plus one NNRTI, the use of TDF in adults and ABC in children was associated with an increase in four major non- thymidine analogue mutations. In a minority of patients, LPV/r-use was associated with intermediate or high-level LPV resistance with predominantly low-level DRV cross-resistance. © 2013 Van Zyl et al.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067188;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e67188;;

With 3 available drug classes, 2 ART sequencing lines are programmatically foreseen. The emergence and transmission of viral drug resistance represents a challenge to the efficacy of ART. Knowledge of HIV-1 drug resistance selection associated with specific drugs and regimens and the consequent activity of residual drug options are essential in programming ART sequencing options aimed at preserving ART efficacy for as long as possible. This article determines optimal ART sequencing options for overcoming HIV-1 drug resistance in resource-limited settings, using currently available drugs and treatment monitoring opportunities. From the perspective of drug resistance and on the basis of limited virologic monitoring data, optimal sequencing seems to involve use of a tenofovir-containing nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor-based first-line regimen, followed by a zidovudine-containing, protease inhibitor (PI)-based second-line regimen. Other options and their consequences are explored by considering within-class and between-class sequencing opportunities, including boosted PI monotherapies and future options with integrase inhibitors. Nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor resistance pathways in HIV-1 subtype C suggest an additional reason for accelerating stavudine phase out. Viral load monitoring avoids the accumulation of resistance mutations that significantly reduce the activity of next-line options. Rational use of resources, including broader access to viral load monitoring, will help ensure 3 lines of fully active treatment options, thereby increasing the duration of ART success. © The Author 2013.

These additional targets have added a new dimension to fight against HIV. Cellular entry of HIV is a multistep procedure involving a range of cellular and molecular interactions between virus envelope protein and receptors expressed on the surface of the target cells, thus providing many opportunities to block infection. Some of these entry inhibitors are currently being used in the clinic and more compounds are under various stages of development. Integration of the HIV-1 DNA is required and essential to maintain the viral DNA in the infected cell. The design and discovery of integrase inhibitors were first focused at targeting the catalytic site of integrase that selectively acting on strand transfer and thus inhibits integration of virus DNA with host cell genome. Thus, entry and integrase inhibitors present a real added value in combined treatment against HIV infection. This review discusses the recent development in the discovery of inhibitors of HIV entry and integration along with some of recent patents in the field. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.;http://www.eurekaselect.com/openurl/content.php?genre=article&issn=1872-213X&volume=7&issue=2&spage=151;2.3;2.6;3.4;1872213X;;;

One of the characteristic features of this agent is activity in the setting of the K103N mutation and higher genetic barrier to resistance in comparison to the first generation agents. Key rilpivirine associated mutations include K101E/P, E138A/G/K/Q/R, V179L, Y181C/I/V, H221Y, F227C, M230I/L and Y188L, while additional variants with possible influence on drug susceptibility are V90I, L100I, K101T, 106I, E138S, V179D/I, Y188L, V189I, G190A/E/S, and M230V. Primary key rilpivirine associated mutations are transmitted infrequently - from 0.4% to 4.6% which warrants widespread use of the agent, while development of secondary drug mutations among patients with viral load below 100,000 copies/ml is comparable to efavirenz. This allows for a durable long-term treatment with rilpivirine. © 2013 Polish AIDS Research Society.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1730127013000775;0.6;0.4;0.5;17301270;;;

However, there is little evidence concerning the risk factors for and clinical characteristics of liver disease in antiretroviral (ARV)-treated HIV infection, in the absence of hepatitis B or C viral co-infection.Methods: A nested case-control study of HIV infected volunteers, matched by starting date of anti-retroviral treatment, was conducted in a Thai cohort studied from Nov 2002 - July 2012. Cases were defined as those subjects with an elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT  40 IU/L) at two consecutive visits six months apart, while controls were defined as individuals who never demonstrated two consecutive elevated ALT results and had a normal ALT result (< 40 IU/L) at their last visit. Both groups had normal ALT levels prior to ARV initiation. Clinical demographics and risk factors for chronic hepatitis including HIV-related illness, ARV treatment and metabolic diseases were collected and analyzed. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for chronic hepatitis in HIV infection.Results: A total of 124 matched pairs with HIV infection were followed over 3,195 person-years. The mean age (±SD) was 33.0 ± 7.3 years, with 41.1% of subjects being male. The incidence of chronic hepatitis was 5.4 per 100 person-years. The median time from initiation of ARV to chronic hepatitis was 1.3 years (IQR, 0.5-3.5). From univariate analysis; male sex, plasma HIV-1 RNA level > 5 log 10 copies/ml, metabolic syndrome at baseline visit, high BMI > 23 kg/m2, abnormal HDL cholesterol at time of ALT elevation and treatment experience with NNRTI plus boosted PI were selected (p value < 0.2) to the final model of multivariate analysis. Male sex had 3.1 times greater risk of chronic hepatitis than the females by multivariate analysis (adjusted OR, 95% CI: 3.1, 1.5-6.3, p =0.002). High BMI  23 kg/m2 was also associated with 2.4 times greater risk of chronic hepatitis (adjusted OR, 95% CI: 2.4, 1.2-4.8, p = 0.01).Conclusions: Chronic hepatitis in ARV-treated HIV-infected patients is common and may lead to a major health care problem. Male sex and high BMI  23 kg/m2 carry higher risks for developing chronic hepatitis in this study. Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored for long-term hepatotoxicity. © 2013 Chalermchai et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.";http://aidsrestherapy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-6405-10-21;3.2;3.8;4.4;;21;;

Continued success of ART programs will require understanding the emergence of HIV drug resistance patterns among individuals in whom treatment has failed and managing ART from both an individual and public health perspective. We review data on the emergence of HIV drug resistance among individuals in whom first-line therapy has failed and clinical and resistance outcomes of those receiving second-line therapy in resource-limited settings.ResultsResistance surveys among patients initiating first-line nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based therapy suggest that 76%-90% of living patients achieve HIV RNA suppression by 12 months after ART initiation. Among patients with detectable HIV RNA at 12 months, HIV drug resistance, primarily due to M184V and NNRTI mutations, has been identified in 60%-72%, although the antiretroviral activity of proposed second-line regimens has been preserved. Complex mutation patterns, including thymidine-analog mutations, K65R, and multinucleoside mutations, are prevalent among cases of treatment failure identified by clinical or immunologic methods. Approximately 22% of patients receiving second-line therapy do not achieve HIV RNA suppression by 6 months, with poor adherence, rather than HIV drug resistance, driving most failures. Major protease inhibitor resistance at the time of second-line failure ranges from 0% to 50%, but studies are limited.ConclusionsResistance of HIV to first-line therapy is predictable at 12 months when evaluated by means of HIV RNA monitoring and, when detected, largely preserves second-line therapy options. Optimizing adherence, performing resistance surveillance, and improving treatment monitoring are critical for long-term prevention of drug resistance. © The Author 2013.

Seventy-five HIV-1 infected patients matched for gender, age, and renal function made up the control. All subjects completed follow-up visits over 48 weeks. CD4 cell count, plasma HIV-1 viral load, and urine protein level were assessed at the trial start (baseline, week 0) and at week 48. The serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were monitored at each follow-up point. Change in eGFR from baseline to week 48 was also compared.Results: Compared to control, the TDF+PI/r group exhibited higher levels of serum creatinine (79 vs. 69.7 mol/L, P<0.001) and a lower rate of eGFR (93.0 vs. 101.6 ml/min/1.73m2, P=0.009) at the end of week 48. Patients treated with TDF+PI/r showed greater decline in eGFR than control (-8.8 vs. 6.4ml/min/1.73m2, P<0.001). Compared to baseline renal function of the control group, the TDF+PI/r group exhibited a greater median decline in eGFR at the end of week 48 (P<0.001).Conclusions: We found that a TDF+PI/r based ART regimen resulted in greater renal function decline over 48 weeks. Therefore, renal function should be monitored especially when TDF is used in combination with PI/r.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00872417. © 2013 Cao et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.";http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-13-301;4.5;4.3;4.1;;301;;

Low-level plasma viremia has been detected in patients treated for over 7 years, but the cellular compartments that support this low-level viremia have not been identified. The decay of HIV-1 during treatment appears to occur in four phases, with the 3rd and 4th phases occurring when the virus is below the limit of detection of conventional assays. Here, we focus on the 3rd phase of decay, which has been estimated to have a half-life of 39 months. We show that follicular dendritic cells (FDC), which have been identified as an HIV reservoir, can be the main source of the low-level viremia detected during the 3rd phase of decay and contribute to viremia at even longer times. Our calculations show that the kinetics of leakage of virus from FDC is consistent with three types of available clinical data. © 2013, American Society for Microbiolog.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/87/14/7893;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;

This study evaluated divergences of the interpretation of the genotyping in two commonly used algorithms, using sequences with indels of reverse transcriptase genes. Methods: Sequences were obtained from virus RNA of patients failing highly active antiretroviral therapy from 2004 to 2011. Alignments were obtained using Clustal W including subtype B consensus and HXB2. Sequences with evidence of indels were submitted to the Stanford Resistance Database and to the Geno2Pheno to locate indel positioning and determine the resistance profile. Results: A total of 1,959 partial reverse transcriptase sequences were assessed, mostly subtype B (74%). Insertions and deletions were observed in 0.9 and 0.6% of sequences, respectively. Discordant insert positioning was assigned for most (90%) insertion sequences, with 27% discordances for deletions. Susceptibility differed for some antiretroviral drugs, predominantly for TDF, d4T and ETV, when sequences with deletions were evaluated. Conclusion: Both indel positioning and its impact on drug susceptibility varies depending on the algorithm, a fact that might influence the clinical decision. Critical analysis of indel sequences with manual alignments is important, and its use alongside different algorithms may be important to better understand the outcomes of genotypic resistance prediction.

If this hypothesis would be confirmed, LPV drug monitoring could improve the efficacy of mtLPVr regimens. Patients with previous virological failure (VF) on protease inhibitor-based regimens were also included if the genotypic resistance tests showed no major resistance mutation associated with reduced susceptibility to lopinavir-ritonavir. VF was defined as 2 consecutive determinations of HIV RNA levels of>200 copies/ml. Efficacy was analyzed by per-protocol analysis. Plasma LPV trough concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography using a UV detector. A total of 127 patients were included (22% with previous failure on protease inhibitors). After 96 weeks, the efficacy rate was 82.3% (95% confidence interval [CI95], 75.3 to 89.3%). Virological efficacy was independent of LPV plasma concentrations even when LPVr was given once daily. An adherence of <90% (HR, 4.4 [CI95, 1.78 to 10.8; P 0.001]) and the presence of blips in the preceding 12 months (HR, 3.06 [CI95, 1.17 to 8.01; P 0.022]) were the only variables independently associated with time to VF. These findings suggest that the LPV concentrations achieved with the standard doses of LPVr are sufficient to maintain virological control during monotherapy and that measurement of LPV concentrations is not useful for predicting virological outcome. Tight control of viral replication in the previous months and strict adherence throughout the mtLPVr regimen could improve the virological efficacy of this maintenance regimen. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.

Anemia is one of the commonly observed hematologic manifestations in HIV positive persons and it has multifactorial origin.Objective:We aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of anemia in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) naïve and HAART experienced HIV positive persons.Methods:A facility-based comparative cross sectional study was conducted in Jimma University Specialized Hospital from February 1 to March 30, 2012. A total of 234 HIV positive persons, 117 HAART naïve and 117 HAART experienced, were enrolled in this study. Blood and stool specimens were collected from each participant. Blood specimens were examined for complete blood count, CD4 count and blood film for malaria hemoparasite; whereas stool specimens were checked for ova of intestinal parasites. Socio-demographic characteristics and clinical data of the participants were collected using pre-tested questionnaire. Statistical analysis of the data (Chi-square, student's t-test, logistic regression) was done using SPSS V-16.Results:The overall prevalence of anemia was 23.1%. The prevalence of anemia in HAART naïve and HAART experienced persons was 29.9% and 16.2%, respectively (P = 0.014). Presence of opportunistic infections (P = 0.004, 95% CI = 1.69-15.46), CD4 count <200 cells/l (P = 0.001, 95% CI = 2.57-36.89) and rural residence (P = 0.03, 95% CI = 1.12-10.39) were found to be predictors of anemia for HAART naïve participants. On the other hand, HAART regimen (ZDV/3TC/NVP) (P = 0.019, 95% CI = 0.01-1.24) and the duration of HAART (P = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.003-0.40.24) were found to be predictors of anemia for HAART experienced groups.Conclusion:The prevalence of anemia in HAART naïve persons was higher than HAART experienced persons. Risk factors for anemia in HAART naïve and HAART experienced HIV positive persons were different. Hence, there is a need for longitudinal study to further explore the causes of HIV associated anemia and the pattern of hemoglobin changes with initiation of HAART. © 2013 Gedefaw et al.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0072202;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e72202;;

Design: The Joint Clinical Research Centre (JCRC) in Kampala, Uganda has provided over 2000 drug-resistant genotypes (DRGs) over the past 10 years as standard of care for patients failing therapy and 1403 from treatment-naive and experienced patients over the past 10 years have been analyzed for this study. Method: Viral loads, CD4 cell count, treatment histories and other relevant clinical data was compared with the infecting HIV-1 subtype and DRGs of Ugandan patients failing treatment. Results: Patients failing HAART with DRGs (n=937) were more frequently infected with subtype D than expected on the basis of the subtype distribution in the treatmentnaive population (n=655) in Kampala (P<0.001). Higher proportions of treatment failures among subtype D-infected patients were driven by resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) (P<0.0002) more than to non-NRTIs (P>0.04) or protease inhibitors. Conclusion: Higher rates of treatment failure among subtype D as compared with subtype A-infected Ugandans was analogous to the faster disease progression in subtype D-infected patients. The mechanism(s) by which drug resistance may emerge faster in subtype D HIV-1 may relate to higher replicative fitness and increased propensity for a CXCR4 tropism. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.;http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201307310-00007;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

Our objective was to specify a multivariate regression model to estimate changes in disease progression among individuals on highly active antiretroviral treatment in British Columbia, Canada, 1996-2011. Methods: We used population-level data on disease progression and antiretroviral treatment utilization from the BC HIV Drug Treatment Program. Disease progression was captured using longitudinal CD4 and plasma viral load testing data, linked with data on antiretroviral treatment. The study outcome was categorized into (CD4 count  500, 500-350, 350-200, <200 cells/mm3, and mortality). A 5-state continuous-time Markov model was used to estimate covariate-specific probabilities of CD4 progression, focusing on temporal changes during the study period. Results: A total of 210,083 CD4 measurements among 7421 individuals with HIV/AIDS were included in the study. Results of the multivariate model suggested that current highly active antiretroviral treatment at baseline, lower baseline CD4 (<200 cells/mm 3), and extended durations of elevated plasma viral load were each associated with accelerated progression. Immunological improvement was accelerated significantly from 2004 onward, with 23% and 46% increases in the probability of CD4 improvement from the fourth CD4 stratum (CD4 < 200) in 2004-2008 and 2008-2011, respectively. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the impact of innovations in antiretroviral treatment and treatment delivery at the population level. These results can be used to estimate a transition probability matrix flexible to changes in the observed mix of clients in different clinical stages and treatment regimens over time.

HIV viral load (VL) and HIV drug-resistance (HIVDR) outcomes at month 12 were determined in a prospective cohort study of antiretroviral-naïve HIV patients initiating first-line therapy in Kigali. Treatment response was monitored clinically and by regular CD4 counts and targeted HIV viral load (VL) to confirm drug failure. VL measurements and HIVDR genotyping were performed retrospectively on baseline and month 12 samples. One hundred and fifty-eight participants who completed their month 12 follow-up visit had VL data available at month 12. Most of them (88%) were virologically suppressed (VL1000 copies/mL) but 18 had virological failure (11%), which is in the range of WHO-suggested targets for HIVDR prevention. If only CD4 criteria had been used to classify treatment response, 26% of the participants would have been misclassified as treatment failure. Pre-therapy HIVDR was documented in 4 of 109 participants (3.6%) with an HIVDR genotyping results at baseline. Eight of 12 participants (66.7%) with virological failure and HIVDR genotyping results at month 12 were found to harbor mutation(s), mostly NNRTI resistance mutations, whereas 4 patients had no HIVDR mutations. Almost half (44%) of the participants initiated ART at CD4 count 200cell/l and severe CD4 depletion at baseline (<50 cells/l) was associated with virological treatment failure (p = 0.008).Although the findings may not be generalizable to all HIV patients in Rwanda, our data suggest that first-line ART regimen changes are currently not warranted. However, the accumulation of acquired HIVDR mutations in some participants underscores the need to reinforce HIVDR prevention strategies, such as increasing the availability and appropriate use of VL testing to monitor ART response, ensuring high quality adherence counseling, and promoting earlier identification of HIV patients and enrollment into HIV care and treatment programs. © 2013 Rusine et al.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064345;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e64345;;

Fifty plasma specimens, collected in 2010-2011, from HIV-1-infected patients failing first-line antiretroviral (ARV) regimens (constituted of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors+one nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) (n=38) and from HIV-1-infected individuals untreated with ARV (n=12) were analyzed in the gag and gag-pol cleavage sites. Compared to HXB2 reference sequence, the total median number of substitutions in gag and gag-pol CS was 10 (range, 5-18). The cleavage site p2/NC was the most variable of the four gag CS with 100% (50/50) isolates carrying at least 1 substitution (range, 1-9). The two gag-pol TFP/p6pol and p6pol/PR CS sites were also highly variable (at least one substitution, 50/50, 100% in both cases). Substitutions at position G381 (p2/NC), L449 (p1/p6gag), and K444 (TFP/p6pol) were significantly more frequent in CRF02-AG strains, compared to other non-B strains (30.4% vs. 3.7%, p=0.03; 87.0% vs. 59.3%, p=0.03; and 91.3% vs. 59.3%, p=0.01, respectively). Other non-B subtypes were significantly more likely to harbor substitutions at position N487 (p6 pol) (70.4%) than CRF02-AG (39.1%) (p=0.02). In Gabon, gag and gag-pol cleavage sites were highly polymorphic in protease inhibitor-naive patients harboring non-B HIV-1 strains. In sub-Saharan Africa, further studies are definitively required to better understand the impact of gag mutations among subjects receiving second-line LPV/r-containing regimens (monotherapy or triple combinations). © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.";http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2013.0024;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

Methods: Three hundred HIV-1-infected patients failing a first-line NNRTI-containing regimen (nevirapine, n=148; efavirenz, n=152) were included in the analysis. Virological failure was defined as viraemia 400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL for the first time at least 6 months after starting the NNRTI-based regimen. For each patient, a genotypic resistance test at failure was available. The presence of drug-resistance mutations in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was evaluated by comparing patients treated with NNRTI + zidovudine + lamivudine vs. those treated with NNRTI + non-TA. Results: A total of 208 patients were failing with NNRTI + zidovudine + lamivudine and 92 with NNRTI + non-TA. No significant differences were observed between the non-TA group and the ZDV group regarding the time of virological failure [median (interquartile range): 12 (8-25) vs. 13 (9-32) months, respectively; P=0.119] and viraemia [median (interquartile range): 4.0 (3.2-4.9) vs. 4.0 (3.3-4.7) log10 copies/mL, respectively; P=0.894]. Resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) occurred at a significant lower frequency in the non-TA group than in the ZDV group (54.3 vs. 75.5%, respectively; P=0.001). This difference was mainly attributable to a significantly lower prevalence of NNRTI resistance (54.3 vs. 74.0%, respectively; P=0.002) and of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutation M184V (23.9 vs. 63.5%, respectively; P<0.001) in the non-TA group compared with the ZDV group. As expected, the mutation K65R was found only in the non-TA group (18.5%; P<0.001). Conclusions: At first-line regimen failure, a lower prevalence of RTI resistance was found in patients treated with NNRTI + non-TA compared with those treated with NNRTI + zidovudine + lamivudine. These results confirm that the choice of backbone may influence the prevalence of drug resistance at virological failure. © 2013 British HIV Association.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/hiv.12044;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;

However, the lack of a standardized high-throughput assay has precluded their detection in clinical settings. Objective: To evaluate the performance of the Roche prototype 454 UDS HIV-1 drug resistance assay (UDS assay) in a routine diagnostic laboratory. Study design: 50 plasma samples, previously characterized by population sequencing and that had shown 1 resistance associated mutation (RAM), were retrospectively tested by the UDS assay, including 18 B and 32 non-B subtypes; viral loads between 114-1,806,407. cp/ml; drug-naive (n=27) and drug-experienced (n=23) individuals. Results: The UDS assay was successful for 37/50 (74%) samples. It detected all RAMs found by population sequencing at frequencies above 20%. In addition, 39 low-frequency RAMs were exclusively detected by the UDS assay at frequencies below 20% in both drug-naïve (19/26, 73%) and drug-experienced (9/18, 50%) individuals. UDS results would lead to changes from susceptible to resistant to efavirenz (EFV) in one drug-naive individual with suboptimal response to an EFV-containing regimen and from susceptible to resistance to lamivudine (3TC) in one drug naïve subject who subsequently failed a 3TC-containing regimen and in a treatment experienced subject who had failed a 3TC-containing regimen. Conclusions: The UDS assay performed well across a wide range of subtypes and viral loads; it showed perfect agreement with population sequencing for all RAMs analyzed. In addition, the UDS assay detected additional mutations at frequencies below 20% which correlate with patients' treatment history and had in some cases important prognostic implications. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1386653213002849;5.7;6.0;5.9;13866532;;;

We conducted this study to determine the pattern of efavirenz and nevirapine plasma drug concentrations among adult HIV-infected patients with immunological failure attending at a tertiary hospital in North-western Tanzania.Materials and Methods:A cross-sectional study was conducted among adult HIV-infected patients with immunological failure who have been on either efavirenz or nevirapine based antiretroviral regimen for more than 6 months. Patients were serially enrolled through routine Care and Treatment Clinic (CTC) activities. Plasma drug concentrations for efavirenz and nevirapine were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Gas Chromatography (GC) respectively. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data such as viral load and CD4 counts were collected. Data analysis was done using STATA 12.Results:Of the 152 patients with immunological failure enrolled, the sub-therapeutic, therapeutic and supra-therapeutic plasma antiretroviral drug concentrations were found in 43/152 (28.3%), 76/152 (50.0%) and 33/152 (21.7%) respectively. Half of the patients were outside therapeutic window with either sub-therapeutic or supra-therapeutic plasma ARV drug concentrations. There was a significant difference in distribution of ARV adherence (p-value<0.001), NRTI backbone (p-value = 0.039), HIV stage (p-value = 0.026) and viral load (p-value = 0.007) within sub-therapeutic, therapeutic and supra-therapeutic ARV plasma drug concentrations.Conclusion:There is a wide inter-individual variability of plasma ARV concentrations among HIV patients with immunological failure, with a large proportion of patients being outside therapeutic window. This variability is significant based on ARV adherence, NRTI backbone, viral load and HIV stage. Routine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) could assist identifying these patients early and making timely correction to avoid virological failure, poor immunological outcome and prevent associated drug toxicities. Nonetheless, ARV adherence should be strictly emphasized on HIV patients with immunological failure. © 2013 Gunda et al.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0075118;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e75118;;

Genotypic resistance testing was performed using the in-house SATuRN/Life Technologies system. Sequences were analysed and genotypic susceptibility scores (GSS) for standard second-line regimens were calculated using the Stanford HIVDB 6.0.5 algorithms.Results:A total of 222 adults were successfully genotyped for HIV drug resistance between December 2010 and March 2012. The most common regimens at time of genotype were stavudine, lamivudine and efavirenz (51%); and stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine (24%). Median duration of ART was 42 months (interquartile range (IQR) 32-53) and median duration of antiretroviral failure was 27 months (IQR 17-40). One hundred and ninety one (86%) had at least one drug resistance mutation. For 34 individuals (15%), the GSS for the standard second-line regimen was <2, suggesting a significantly compromised regimen. In univariate analysis, individuals with a prior nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) substitution were more likely to have a GSS <2 than those on the same NRTIs throughout (odds ratio (OR) 5.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.60-12.49).Conclusions:There are high levels of drug resistance in adults with failure of first-line antiretroviral therapy in this rural primary health care programme.

Genotyping of drug-resistant individuals was conducted using an in-house assay on plasma samples. Viral load, CD4 T cell counts and demographic data were obtained from medical records and an administered questionnaire.Results:A total of 609 pol sequences (515 ART-failure and 94 therapy-naïve individuals) derived from 664 samples were obtained. The prevalence of drug-resistance was 45.1% in the ART-failure individuals. Of these, 26.8% harbored HIV strains dually resistant to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and 14.8% harbored HIV strains resistant to only one drug category. Mutations such as M184V/I, K103N, V106A, Y181C and G190A were common among the ART-failure individuals, and the frequencies of M184V/I, K103N and V106A were 28.2%, 19.2%, and 22.1%, respectively. The percentages of individuals exhibiting intermediate or high-level resistance to 3TC, FTC, EFV and NVP drugs were 28.4%, 28.2%, 37.3%, and 37.5%, respectively. Factors such as ethnicity, transmission route, CD4 counts, viral load and the duration of ART were significantly correlated with development of drug resistance in the ART-failure individuals.Conclusions:The high prevalence of HIV drug-resistance observed among the ART-failure individuals from 2010 to 2011 in Yunnan province should be of increasing concern in regions where the implementation of ART is widespread. Education about the risk factors associated with HIV drug resistance is important for preventing and controlling the spread of HIV drug-resistant strains. © 2013 Li et al.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0072630;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e72630;;

Objectives: To study specific personal barriers to ART adherence. Methods: Quantitative data on patients' health status, ART adherence, CD4 cell counts and viral loads were collected, and qualitative data on life experiences of five patients with poor ART outcomes and adherence were also collected. Results: Out of 35 patients with poor immunological and virological ART outcomes, 17 (49%) also had poor ART adherence. Patient 1 had no living child and did not disclose her HIV serostatus to her spouse because she wanted to have a child. Patient 2 was an orphan with neither social nor family support. Patient 3 stopped ART when she conceived, returned to the study clinic when pregnant again and was sickly. She was switched to second-line ART with satisfactory outcomes. Patient 4, a 14 year old orphan had missed ART for 2 months when his treatment supporter was away. Patient 5 aged 66 years stopped ART which he blamed for his erectile dysfunction. Conclusions: ART adherence counselling should target specific personal barriers to ART adherence like: lack of family support, health and sexual life concerns, desire to have children and family instability.;http://www.ajol.info/index.php/ahs/article/view/93483;2.2;2.2;2.0;16806905;;;

In multivariable analyses, increased LBM was associated with an increased hip BMD. Conclusion: ABC/3TC vs. TDF/FTC did not differ in change in weight, BMI, or LBM; ATV/r vs. EFV resulted in greater weight and BMI gain but not LBM.

The study aim was to determine the impact of polymorphisms in regions known to harbor major nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance mutations (codons 90-108, 135-138, 179-190, 225-348) on virologic responses to first-line NNRTI-based ART. Methods: Reverse transcriptase sequences from ART-naive individuals who commenced efavirenz (EFV) or nevirapine (NVP) with at least two nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) without major drug resistance mutations were analyzed. The impact of polymorphisms on week 4 viral load decrease and time to virologic failure was measured over a median 97 weeks. Results: Among 4528 patients, most were infected with HIV-1 subtype B (67%) and commenced EFV-based ART (84%). Overall, 2598 (57%) had at least one polymorphism, most frequently at codons 90, 98, 101, 103, 106, 135, 138, 179, and 238. Virologic failure rates were increased in patients with two (n=597) or more than two (n=72) polymorphisms [adjusted hazard ratio 1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.92; P=0.016]. Polymorphisms associated with virologic failure occurred at codons 90 (mostly V90I), 98 (mostly A98S), and 103 (mostly K103R), with adjusted hazard ratios of 1.78 (1.15-2.73; P=0.009), 1.55 (1.16-2.08; P=0.003), and 1.75 (1.00-3.05: P=0.049), respectively. Polymorphisms at codon 179, especially V179D/E/T, predicted reduced week 4 responses (P=0.001) but not virologic failure. Conclusion: The occurrence of multiple polymorphisms, though uncommon, was associated with a small increase in the risk of NNRTI treatment failure; significant effects were seen with polymorphisms at codon 90, 98, and 103. The mechanisms underlying the slower suppression seen with V179D/E/T deserve further investigation. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.";http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201309100-00011;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

K65R, K103N and M184V/I mutation frequencies were determined each year. Statistical analyses were performed using Fisher's exact test. Among 9586 patients failing their antiretroviral-based regimens from 2005 to 2010, the prevalence of K65R tended to decrease (P=0.054), while K103N and M184V/I mutation frequencies decreased significantly over time (P<0.001). The increased use of a tenofovir/emtricitabine/efavirenz single-tablet regimen was associated with decreased selection of these mutations.Conclusions: Theglobal prevalence of resistance-associatedmutationsto tenofovir, lamivudine/emtricitabineand efavirenz decreased over time between 2005 and 2010. Despite a stable rate of efavirenz and protease inhibitor use, this phenomenon can be explained by an increased use of single-tablet regimens, which simplify drug intake and maximize adherence. © The Author 2013.

An extracavitary or solid variant of PEL has also been described. Human herpes virus 8/Kaposi sarcomaassociated herpes virus (HHV-8/KSHV) is universally associated with the pathogenesis of PEL. More than 70% of cases occur with concurrent Epstein-Barr virus infection, but its relation to the pathogenesis is unknown. Patients are found in the context of immunosuppressive states (HIV-1 infection, post-organ transplantation). PEL is usually treated with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone)-like chemotherapy with antiretroviral therapy if HIV-1 is positive. However, it is generally resistant to chemotherapy with a short median survival of less than 6 months. The optimal treatment for PEL has not been established yet. More intensive chemotherapy, such as doseadjusted EPOCH (DA-EPOCH; etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin) and CDE (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide) are expected to show a favorable prognosis. Recently, the molecular steps in KSHV/HHV-8-driven oncogenesis have begun to be revealed, and molecular targeting therapies such as proteasome, NF-êB, cytokines and surface antigens would provide evidence for their clinical use. © 2014, International Research and Cooperation Association for Bio & Socio-Sciences Advancement.

Drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) minority variants (MVs) are present in some antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive patients. They may result from de novo mutagenesis or transmission. To date, the latter has not been proven.Methods. MVs were quantified by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction in 204 acute or recent seroconverters from the Zurich Primary HIV Infection study and 382 ART-naive, chronically infected patients. Phylogenetic analyses identified transmission clusters.Results. Three lines of evidence were observed in support of transmission of MVs. First, potential transmitters were identified for 12 of 16 acute or recent seroconverters harboring M184V MVs. These variants were also detected in plasma and/or peripheral blood mononuclear cells at the estimated time of transmission in 3 of 4 potential transmitters who experienced virological failure accompanied by the selection of the M184V mutation before transmission. Second, prevalence between MVs harboring the frequent mutation M184V and the particularly uncommon integrase mutation N155H differed highly significantly in acute or recent seroconverters (8.2% vs 0.5%; P <. 001). Third, the prevalence of less-fit M184V MVs is significantly higher in acutely or recently than in chronically HIV-1-infected patients (8.2% vs 2.5%; P =. 004).Conclusions. Drug-resistant HIV-1 MVs can be transmitted. To what extent the origin - transmission vs sporadic appearance - of these variants determines their impact on ART needs to be further explored. © 2013 The Author 2013.";https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/208/7/1102/2192875;10.4;9.2;9.0;00221899;;;

Longitudinal data on secondary resistance are rare. METHODS:: We conducted a prospective cohort study of HIV-1-infected adults initiating ART in 3 clinics using computerized monitoring systems. Patients had plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL) tests at months 12 (M12) and 24 (M24) after ART initiation and HIV-1 resistance genotype tests if VL was detectable (300 copies/mL). RESULTS:: Overall, 1573 patients initiated ART with stavudine/zidovudine plus lamivudine plus nevirapine/efavirenz. At M12 and M24, 944 and 844 patients, respectively, remained in active follow-up. Among them, 25% (M12) and 27% (M24) had detectable VLs and 12% (M12) and 19% (M24) had virus resistant to at least 1 antiretroviral drug, accounting for 54% (M12) and 75% (M24) of patients with detectable VLs. Among the resistant strains, 95% (M12) and 97% (M24) were resistant to lamivudine/emtricitabine, efavirenz, and/or nevirapine, the frequency of thymidine analog mutations increased from 8.1% (M12) to 14.7% (M24) and etravirine resistance increased from 13.5% (M12) to 24.5% (M24). CONCLUSIONS:: Of the patients with detectable VLs at M24, 25% still did not harbor resistant virus. Preventing mutations from emerging with adherence reinforcement in patients with detectable VLs remains important beyond M24. Switching therapy early in patients with resistance to 3 TC/FTC and/or to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors to prevent extended resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and etravirine resistance from occurring is also a major challenge.

Thirty-eight patients on antituberculosis therapy based on rifampin and isoniazid participated in the substudy (57.9% males; median age, 33 years; median weight, 51.9 kg; median CD4+ T cell count, 104 cells/l; median HIV-1 RNA load, 5.5 log copies/ml). The daily doses of rifampin and isoniazid were 10 and 5 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. Twenty-one patients received 200 mg of nevirapine twice a day (b.i.d.), and 17 patients received 600 mg of efavirenz once a day (q.d.) in combination with lamivudine and stavudine from day 1 until the end of the study. Blood samples were collected at regular time-dosing intervals after morning administration of a fixed-dose combination of rifampin and isoniazid. When rifampin was administered alone, the median maximum concentration of drug in serum (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) at steady state were 6.59 mg/liter (range, 2.70 to 14.07 mg/ liter) and 27.69 mg.h/liter (range, 11.41 to 109.75 mg.h/liter), respectively. Concentrations remained unchanged when rifampin was coadministered with nevirapine or efavirenz. When isoniazid was administered alone, the median isoniazid Cmax and AUC at steady state were 5.08 mg/liter (range, 1.26 to 11.51 mg/liter) and 20.92 mg.h/liter (range, 7.73 to 56.95 mg.h/liter), respectively. Concentrations remained unchanged when isoniazid was coadministered with nevirapine; however, a 29% decrease in the isoniazid AUC was observed when isoniazid was combined with efavirenz. The pharmacokinetic parameters of rifampin and isoniazid when coadministered with nevirapine or efavirenz were not altered to a clinically significant extent in these severely immunosuppressed HIV-infected patients.

We investigated whether dual therapy with lopinavir and ritonavir plus lamivudine is non-inferior to standard triple therapy. Methods: The GARDEL study (Global AntiRetroviral Design Encompassing Lopinavir/r and Lamivudine vs LPV/r based standard therapy) is a 48 week, phase 3, randomised, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority trial in antiretroviral-therapy-naive adults (age 18 years) with documented HIV-1 RNA viral load of at least 1000 copies per mL. The study was done at 19 centres in six countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to dual therapy or triple therapy by sealed envelopes, in blocks of four, stratified by baseline viral load (<100-000 vs 100-000 copies per mL). Dual therapy consisted of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg plus lamivudine 150 mg, both twice daily. Triple therapy consisted of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily and lamivudine or emtricitabine plus another nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) in fixed-dose combination. Efficacy was analysed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. The primary endpoint was virological response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with HIV RNA less than 50 copies per mL at 48 weeks. Dual therapy was classed as non-inferior to triple therapy if the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference between groups was no lower than -12%. Patients and investigators were unmasked to treatment allocation. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01237444. Findings: Between Dec 10, 2010, and May 15, 2012, 217 patients were randomly assigned to the dual-therapy group and 209 to the triple-therapy group. 198 patients in the dual-therapy group and 175 in the triple-therapy group completed 48 weeks of treatment. At week 48, 189 patients (88·3%) in the dual-therapy group and 169 (83·7%) in the triple-therapy group had viral response (difference 4·6%, 95% CI -2·2 to 11·8; p=0·171). Patients with baseline viral load of at least 100-000 copies per mL showed similar results (87·2% vs 77·9%, respectively; difference 9·3%, 95% CI -2·8 to 21·5; p=0·145). Toxicity-related or tolerability-related discontinuations were more common in the triple-therapy group (n=10 [4·9%]) than in the dual-therapy group (n=1 [0·4%]; difference 4·5%, 95% CI -8·1 to -0·9; p=0·011). 65 adverse events in the dual-therapy group and 88 in the triple-therapy group were possibly or probably drug related (p=0·007). Two serious adverse events occurred, both in the dual-therapy arm, one of which (a case of gastritis) was reported as possibly or probably related to drug treatment. Interpretation: Dual therapy with lopinavir and ritonavir plus lamivudine regimen warrants further clinical research and consideration as a potential therapeutic option for antiretroviral-therapy-naive patients.

Detection of TDR may predict virologic failure of first-line nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART). We evaluated the utility of a relatively inexpensive oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA) to detect clinically relevant TDR at the time of ART initiation. Methods: Pre-ART plasmas from ART-naive Kenyans initiating an NNRTI-based fixed-dose combination ART in a randomized adherence trial conducted in 2006 were retrospectively analyzed by OLA for mutations conferring resistance to NNRTI (K103N, Y181C, and G190A) and lamivudine (M184V). Post-ART plasmas were analyzed for virologic failure (1000 copies/mL) at 6-month intervals over 18-month follow-up. Pre-ART plasmas of those with virologic failure were evaluated for drug resistance by consensus and 454-pyrosequencing. Results: Among 386 participants, TDR was detected by OLA in 3.89% (95% confidence interval: 2.19 to 6.33) and was associated with a 10-fold higher rate of virologic failure (hazard ratio: 10.39; 95% confidence interval: 3.23 to 32.41; P < 0.001) compared with those without TDR. OLA detected 24 TDR mutations (K103N: n = 13; Y181C: n = 5; G190A: n = 3; M184V: n = 3) in 15 subjects (NNRTI: n = 15; 3TC: n = 3). Among 51 participants who developed virologic failure, consensus sequencing did not detect additional TDR mutations conferring high-level resistance, and pyrosequencing only detected additional mutations at frequencies <2%. Mutant frequencies <2% at ART initiation were significantly less likely to be found at the time of virologic failure compared with frequencies 2% (22% vs. 63%; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Detection of TDR by a point mutation assay may prevent the use of suboptimal ART.";http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201411010-00003;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

We used genomewide genotyping and clinical data to characterize determinants of atazanavir pharmacokinetics and hyperbilirubinemia in AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol A5202. Methods: Plasma atazanavir pharmacokinetics and indirect bilirubin concentrations were characterized in HIV-1-infected patients randomized to atazanavir/ritonavir-containing regimens. A subset had genomewide genotype data available. Results: Genomewide assay data were available from 542 participants, of whom 475 also had data on estimated atazanavir clearance and relevant covariates available. Peak bilirubin concentration and relevant covariates were available for 443 participants. By multivariate analysis, higher peak on-treatment bilirubin levels were found to be associated with the UGT1A1 rs887829 T allele (P=6.4×10-12), higher baseline hemoglobin levels (P=4.9×10-13), higher baseline bilirubin levels (P=6.7×10-12), and slower plasma atazanavir clearance (P=8.6×10-11). For peak bilirubin levels greater than 3.0 mg/dl, the positive predictive value of a baseline bilirubin level of 0.5 mg/dl or higher with hemoglobin concentrations of 14 g/dl or higher was 0.51, which increased to 0.85 with rs887829 TT homozygosity. For peak bilirubin levels of 3.0 mg/dl or lower, the positive predictive value of a baseline bilirubin level less than 0.5 mg/dl with a hemoglobin concentration less than 14 g/dl was 0.91, which increased to 0.96 with rs887829 CC homozygosity. No polymorphism predicted atazanavir pharmacokinetics at genomewide significance. Conclusion: Atazanavir-associated hyperbilirubinemia is best predicted by considering UGT1A1 genotype, baseline bilirubin level, and baseline hemoglobin level in combination. Use of ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer may have abrogated genetic associations with atazanavir pharmacokinetics. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.;http://journals.lww.com/01213011-201404000-00002;4.5;5.0;5.6;17446872;;;

All rights reserved.Objectives: Te aim of this study was to ascertain the correlation between various opportunistic infections and complications in human immunodefciency virus (HIV)-1-infected children and the immune status of these patients, evaluated by absolute cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count and CD4 percentage.Methods: This study was conducted from January 2009 to June 2010 at the Antiretroviral Treatment Centre of the Pt. B.D. Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, a tertiary care hospital in Rohtak, Haryana, in northern India. A total of 20 HIV-1-infected children aged 4–57 months were studied. Demographic and baseline investigations were performed prior to the start of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A fixed-dose combination of HAART was given based on the patient’s weight. Baseline investigations were repeated after six months of HAART.Results: There was a significant increase in the patients’ haemoglobin, weight, height and CD4 count after six months of HAART. Significant improvements (P <0.05) were also noted in the patients’ immune status, graded according to the World Health Organization.Conclusion: Tis study observed that the severity and frequency of opportunistic complications in paediatric patients with HIV-1 increased with a fall in the CD4 count. Te treatment of opportunistic infections, along with antiretroviral therapy, may lead to both clinical and immunological recovery as well as a decreased incidence of future opportunistic infections. Te CD4 count may give treating physicians an initial idea about the immune status of each child and could also be used as a biological marker of HAART efficacy. Patient compliance must be ensured during HAART as this is a key factor in improving outcomes.;None;1.7;1.6;1.5;2075051X;;;

Following marketing authorisation in the United States, a marketing application has been submitted in the European Union for the fixed-dose combination of cobicistat (CYP 3A inhibitor), elvitegravir (HIV integrase inhibitor), emtricitabine and tenofovir (HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors). Clinical evaluation is based on two ""non-inferiority"" trials, one versus efavirenz + emtricitabine + tenofovir, and the other versus atazanavir + rito - navir + emtricitabine + tenofovir. Overall, about 85% of patients achieved undetectable viral load 48 weeks after treatment initiation. The cobicistat + elvitegravir + emtricitabine + tenofovir combination had the usual adverse effects of antiretroviral combinations (diarrhoea, nausea, upper respiratory tract infections, neuropsychological disorders, etc.), plus musculoskeletal disorders and renal toxicity. Cobicistat carries a high risk of interactions. The cobicistat + elvitegravir + emtricitabine + tenofovir combination is taken as a single daily tablet. In practice, given the lack of therapeutic progress, it is best to stick with better-documented antiretroviral combinations. Copyright © Prescrire.";None;0.5;0.5;0.5;11677422;;;

All rights reserved.The most important and unique adverse effect of abacavir (ABC) is fatal hypersensitivity reaction (HSR). The objective of this report is to describe a case of ABC induced HSR that occurred in an Indian HIV patient during treatment. Although this adverse effect is not uncommon, it is perhaps underreported or has never been reported so far in an Indian case scenario. A 44-year-old known case of HIV-1 was admitted in view of his worsening condition and very low CD4 cell counts 3 cells/L. He was on anti-retroviral therapy since three years but not regular. On the basis of treatment failure, non-compliance and progressive low CD4 counts, the anti HIV regime was switched over to abacavir 600 mg+ atazanavir/ ritonavir 300mg/100mg Two weeks after ABC therapy he presented with maculopapular rash, headache and signs of hepatic damage (serum AST, ALP and ALT increased to 3-4 fold) suggestive of hypersensitivity reaction. As we know discontinuation of the drug is the ultimate litmus test to confirm diagnosis of drug induced adverse reaction. We did confirm ABC induced HSR by de-challenge wherein, rash disappeared within 2-3 days and LFT came back to normal within 5 days. However, no rechallenge was done. HSR was more in favour of ABC because atazanavir failed to produce any similar reaction after re-challenge.;http://jcdr.net/article_fulltext.asp?issn=0973-709x&year=2014&volume=8&issue=9&page=HD01&issn=0973-709x&id=4820;1.2;0;0;2249782X;;;

Methods: A5202 randomized 1857 treatment-naive subjects to abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir-DF/ emtricitabine with efavirenz or atazanavir/ritonavir. Substudy A5224s measured inflammatory biomarkers on subjects with available plasma from baseline and week 24 or 96. An exploratory analysis of the association of highsensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble receptors of tumor necrosis factor a (sTNF)-RI, sTNF-RII, TNF-a, soluble vascular cellular adhesion molecules (sVCAM-1), and soluble intercellular adhesion molecules (sICAM-1) with times to AIDS and to non-AIDS events used Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Analysis included 244 subjects; 85% men and 48% white non-Hispanic with median age 39 years, HIV-1 RNA of 4.6 log10 copies per milliliter, and CD4 of 240 cells per microliter. Overall, 13 AIDS events (9 opportunistic infections, 3 AIDS-cancers, and 1 recurrent bacterial pneumonia) and 18 non-AIDS events (6 diabetes, 4 cancers, 3 cardiovascular, and 5 pneumonias) occurred. Higher baseline IL-6, sTNF-RI, sTNF-RII, and sICAM-1 were significantly associated with increased risk of AIDS-defining events. Adjustment for baseline HIV-1 RNA did not change results, whereas adjusting for baseline CD4 count left only sTNF-RI and sICAM-1 significantly associated with increased risk. Time-updated values of IL-6, sTNFR-I and II, and sICAM-1 were also associated with an increased risk. For non- AIDS events, only higher baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was significantly associated with increased risk, whereas higher IL-6 was marginally associated with higher risk. Analyses of timeupdated biomarker values showed tumor necrosis factor a to be significantly associated with increased risk, even after adjustment for antiretroviral therapy, and CD4 count or HIV-1 RNA. Conclusions: Higher levels of several inflammatory biomarkers were independently associated with increased risk of AIDS and non- AIDS events.

The primary endpoint was virological success, defined as the first viral load <50 copies/ml. Time to events were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard model. One thousand three hundred five patients met the study inclusion criteria. In a multivariable model adjusting for transmission mode, presence of transmitted drug resistance, baseline CD4+ cell count, viral subtype, and type of NRTI backbone employed, independent predictors of virological success were higher baseline viral load (500,000 vs. <100,000 HR 0.52; P<0.001), a weighted genotypic susceptibility score (wGSS) <3 (HR 0.58; P=0.003), male sex (HR 0.76 P=0.001), and type of initial third drug employed (integrase inhibitor vs. boosted protease inhibitors HR 3.23; P<0.001).

METHODS:: A multicenter prospective cohort of HIV-infected adults in Zambia and South Africa who initiated cART. Outcomes by month 12 on cART were immunological recovery, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss, viral suppression, and drug resistance. We used descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and linear mixed models. RESULTS:: Of the 1087 participants, 92 were HBsAg seropositive, yielding a sample-weighted prevalence of 7.4% (95% confidence interval: 5.6 to 9.2), with 76% genotype HBV-A1. The estimated CD4 recovery on cART was similar between HIV monoinfection and HIV-HBV coinfection groups and between lamivudine- and tenofovir-treated participants. HBsAg loss was documented in 20% (4/20) of lamivudine-treated and 18% (3/17) of tenofovir-treated participants (P = 0.305). Viral suppression (HBV-DNA < 20 IU/mL) was achieved in 61.5% (16/26) of lamivudine-treated and 71.4% (15/21) of tenofovir-treated participants (P = 0.477). HBV pol sequencing demonstrated M204I (n = 3) and N236T (n = 1) resistance-associated mutations in 4 of 8 (50%) lamivudine-treated participants and none in tenofovir-treated participants. Occult HBV infection was present in 13.3% before cART, but by month 12, HBV-DNA was below the limit of detection (<15 IU/mL) in 90.5% (19/21) of lamivudine-treated and 100% (18/18) of tenofovir-treated participants (P = 0.179). CONCLUSIONS:: Tenofovir-containing first-line cART is preferred for HIV-HBV coinfection in Africa because of a superior resistance profile relative to lamivudine monotherapy. Extended follow-up will be needed to determine long-term complications of occult HBV coinfection. Improved access to HBsAg screening and tenofovir is needed.

To investigate the impact of W153L, alone or in combination with the clinically relevant RT resistance substitutions K65R (change of Lys to Arg at position 65), M184I, K101E, K103N, E138K, and Y181C, on HIV-1 phenotypic susceptibility, viral replication, and RT enzymatic function, we generated recombinant RT enzymes and viruses containing each of these substitutions or various combinations of them. We found that W153L-containing viruses were impaired in viral replicative capacity and were hypersusceptible to tenofovir (TFV) while retaining susceptibility to most nonnucleoside RT inhibitors. The nucleoside 3TC retained potency against W153L-containing viruses but not when the M184I substitution was also present. W153L was also able to reverse the effects of the K65R substitution on resistance to TFV, and K65R conferred hypersusceptibility to compound A. Biochemical assays demonstrated that W153L alone or in combination with K65R, M184I, K101E, K103N, E138K, and Y181C impaired enzyme processivity and polymerization efficiency but did not diminish RNase H activity, providing mechanistic insights into the low replicative fitness associated with these substitutions. We show that the mechanism of the TFV hypersusceptibility conferred by W153L is mainly due to increased efficiency of TFV-diphosphate incorporation. These results demonstrate that compound A and/or derivatives thereof have the potential to be important antiretroviral agents that may be combined with tenofovir to achieve synergistic results.

In FLAMINGO, we compared dolutegravir with darunavir plus ritonavir in individuals naive for antiretroviral therapy. Methods In this multicentre, open-label, phase 3b, non-inferiority study, HIV-1-infected antiretroviral therapy-naive adults with HIV-1 RNA concentration of 1000 copies per mL or more and no resistance at screening were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either dolutegravir 50 mg once daily or darunavir 800 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg once daily, with investigator-selected tenofovir.emtricitabine or abacavir.lamivudine. Randomisation was stratifi ed by screening HIV-1 RNA (.100 000 or >100 000 copies per mL) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) selection. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA concentration lower than 50 copies per mL (Food and Drug Administration [FDA] snapshot algorithm) at week 48 with a 12% non-inferiority margin. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01449929. Findings Recruitment began on Oct 31, 2011, and was completed on May 24, 2012, in 64 research centres in nine countries worldwide. Of 595 patients screened, 484 patients were included in the analysis (242 in each group). At week 48, 217 (90%) patients receiving dolutegravir and 200 (83%) patients receiving darunavir plus ritonavir had HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies per mL (adjusted diff erence 7E1%, 95% CI 0E9.13E2), non-inferiority and on pre-specifi ed secondary analysis dolutegravir was superior (p=0E025). Confi rmed virological failure occurred in two (<1%) patients in each group; we recorded no treatment-emergent resistance in either group. Discontinuation due to adverse events or stopping criteria was less frequent for dolutegravir (four [2%] patients) than for darunavir plus ritonavir (ten [4%] patients) and contributed to the diff erence in response rates. The most commonly reported (.10%) adverse events were diarrhoea (dolutegravir 41 [17%] patients vs darunavir plus ritonavir 70 [29%] patients), nausea (39 [16%] vs 43 [18%]), and headache (37 [15%] vs 24 [10%]). Patients receiving dolutegravir had signifi cantly fewer low-density lipoprotein values of grade 2 or higher (11 [2%] vs 36 [7%]; p=0E0001). Interpretation Once-daily dolutegravir was superior to once-daily darunavir plus ritonavir. Once-daily dolutegravir in combination with fixed-dose NRTIs represents an effective new treatment option for HIV-1-infected, treatment-naive patients.

Methods: Antiretroviral-naïve patients who achieved a viral load <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml after induction therapy with twice-daily (bid) lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and fixed-dose zidovudine (ZDV)/lamivudine (3TC) (CBV) were randomly assigned to continue CBV/LPV/r or switch to fixed-dose ZDV/3TC/abacavir (TZV). Patients completed standardized questionnaires on adherence, treatment satisfaction and QoL at randomization (between weeks 12 and 24) and at weeks 48, 72 and 96. Results: Patients on CBV/LPV/r were more likely to have skipped medicines in the last week (P=0.035) and during the preceding weekend (P=0.027) than patients on TZV. Patients on CBV/LPV/r were significantly less satisfied with the convenience of their treatment (P=0.004) and tended to be less satisfied with the side effects of their treatment (P=0.091) and continuation of their present treatment (P=0.056) than patients on TZV. Patients on CBV/LPV/r reported significantly lower levels of role functioning (P=0.013) than patients on TZV.

TDR has the potential to compromise first-line anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in HIV patients and limit the antiretroviral regimens options, which has become an important public health problem. TDR surveillance is an important strategy to monitor the emergence of genetic. TDR has been reported in the United States for many years. Current antiretroviral treatment guidelines recommend drug resistance testing after diagnosis. We did a retrospective analysis of the genotype database of ART-naïve patients from our immunodeficiency clinics at the Erie County Medical Center (ECMC) in Buffalo, New York, United States from 2005 to 2011. The prevalence of TDR in the ECMC-US cohort is still high 13.3%. The drug susceptibility is significantly reduced in 10.9% patients. The mutations were mostly ""old"" drug (such as AZT, D4T, EFV, NVP, SQV/r) related, while most of the ""new"" drugs (such as TDF, RPV, DRV/r) maintained sensitivity. The introduction of new second, third generation drugs in recent years has not brought down the prevalence of TDR significantly. The TDR prevalence rates in the United States are indicative of the fact that drug resistant mutations were generated before or at the beginning of ART and transmitted down from one generation to the other in ART naive patients, emphasizing that additional management strategies are needed to diagnose HIV infected patients earlier and to effectively treat them timely to further reduce TDR. © 2014 Dai L, et al.";https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/tdr-associated-mutations-in-wny-hiv-1-patient-cohort-jaa.1000090.php?aid=24073;0;0;0;;022;;

This benefit may be offset by increased transmitted drug resistance (TDR), which could limit future HIV treatment options. We analyze the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of strategies to reduce TDR. Methods: We develop a deterministic mathematical model representing Kampala, Uganda, to predict the prevalence of TDR over a 10-year period. We then compare the impact on TDR and cost-effectiveness of: (1) introduction of pre-therapy genotyping; (2) doubling use of second-line treatment to 80% (50-90%) of patients with confirmed virological failure on first-line ART; and (3) increasing viral load monitoring from yearly to twice yearly. An intervention can be considered cost-effective if it costs less than three times the gross domestic product per capita per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, or less than $3420 in Uganda. Results: The prevalence of TDR is predicted to rise from 6.7% (interquartile range [IQR] 6.2-7.2%) in 2014, to 6.8% (IQR 6.1-7.6%), 10.0% (IQR 8.9-11.5%) and 11.1% (IQR 9.7-13.0%) in 2024 if treatment is initiated at a CD4 <350, <500, or immediately, respectively. The absolute number of TDR cases is predicted to decrease 4.4-8.1% when treating earlier compared to treating at CD4 <350 due to the preventative effects of earlier treatment. Most cases of TDR can be averted by increasing second-line treatment (additional 7.1-10.2% reduction), followed by increased viral load monitoring (<2.7%) and pre-therapy genotyping (<1.0%). Only increasing second-line treatment is cost-effective, ranging from $1612 to $2234 (IQR $450-dominated) per QALY gained. Conclusions: While earlier treatment initiation will result in a predicted increase in the proportion of patients infected with drug-resistant HIV, the absolute numbers of patients infected with drug-resistant HIV is predicted to decrease. Increasing use of second-line treatment to all patients with confirmed failure on first-line therapy is a cost-effective approach to reduce TDR. Improving access to second-line ART is therefore a major priority.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.7448/IAS.17.1.19164;5.5;6.7;7.1;;19164;;

This 3-quinolineacetic acid derivative series was identified using an enzymatic integrase long terminal repeat (LTR) DNA 3'-processing assay. A combination of medicinal chemistry, parallel synthesis, and structure-guided drug design led to the identification of BI 224436 as a candidate for preclinical profiling. It has antiviral 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) of<15 nM against different HIV-1 laboratory strains and cellular cytotoxicity of>90 M. BI 224436 also has a low,2.1-fold decrease in antiviral potency in the presence of 50% human serum and, by virtue of a steep dose-response curve slope, exhibits serum-shifted EC95 values ranging between 22 and 75 nM. Passage of virus in the presence of inhibitor selected for either A128T, A128N, or L102F primary resistance substitutions, all mapping to a conserved allosteric pocket on the catalytic core of integrase. BI 224436 also retains full antiviral activity against recombinant viruses encoding INSTI resistance substitutions N155S, Q148H, and E92Q. In drug combination studies performed in cellular antiviral assays, BI 224436 displays an additive effect in combination with most approved antiretrovirals, including INSTIs. BI 224436 has drug-like in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties, including Caco-2 cell permeability, solubility, and low cytochrome P450 inhibition.

To date, a detailed safety review of DTG has not been provided in the literature. Objective: To describe the safety and tolerability profile of DTG in adults based on 5 randomized, controlled trials and comparison with drugs in 3 major antiretroviral (ARV) classes. Methods: Safety data from phase IIb/III/IIIb trials in ART-naive and ART-experienced, INI-naive adults were integrated. Results: In 4 ART-naive (SPRING-1, SPRING-2, SINGLE, FLAMINGO) and 1 ART-experienced, INI-naive study (SAILING), 1,579 individuals received a DTG-containing regimen. The proportion of individuals from DTG treatment arms who withdrew due to adverse events (AEs) was low (2%) compared to raltegravir (RAL; 2% SPRING-2, 4% SAILING), efavirenz (EFV)-containing comparator arm (10% SINGLE), and darunavir + ritonavir (DRV/r; 4% FLAMINGO). The most frequently observed AEs (diarrhea, nausea, headache), typically grade 1 or 2 in severity, did not lead to study discontinuation. Psychiatric and nervous system disorders with DTG were comparable to RAL- and DRV/r-containing regimens and favorable to EFV-containing regimens. In hepatitis B and/or C coinfected ART-naive individuals, the incidence of transaminase elevations was lower with DTG versus RAL and EFV comparators, but was similar to DRV/r. In SAILING, transaminase elevations were more commonly observed with DTG, particularly in the setting of inadequate hepatitis B therapy or immune reconstitution. On DTG treatment, mild creatinine elevations occurred and stabilized early. Few cases of hypersensitivity reaction and/or severe rash were seen. Rates of these events were comparable to or lower than with RAL-, EFV-, and DRV/r-containing regimens. Conclusions: The safety profile for DTG 50 mg once daily in INI-naive individuals was comparable to RAL- and DRV/r-containing regimens and generally favorable compared with EFV-containing regimens.";http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1310/hct1505-199;2.8;2.7;0;15284336;;;

We assessed the 96 week efficacy and safety of an NtRTI-sparing regimen. Methods Between August, 2010, and September, 2011, we enrolled treatment-naive adults into this randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial in treatment-naive adults in 15 European countries. The composite primary outcome was change to randomised treatment before week 32 because of insufficient virological response, no virological response by week 32, HIV-1 RNA concentration 50 copies per mL or higher at any time after week 32; death from any cause; any new or recurrent AIDS event; or any serious non-AIDS event. Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral treatment with 400 mg raltegravir twice daily plus 800 mg darunavir and 100 mg ritonavir once daily (NtRTI-sparing regimen) or tenofovir-emtricitabine in a 245 mg and 200 mg fixed-dose combination once daily, plus 800 mg darunavir and 100 mg ritonavir once daily (standard regimen). This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01066962. Findings Of 805 patients enrolled, 401 received the NtRTI-sparing regimen and 404 the standard regimen, with median follow-up of 123 weeks (IQR 112-133). Treatment failure was seen in 77 (19%) in the NtRTI-sparing group and 61 (15%) in the standard group. Kaplan-Meier estimated proportions of treatment failure by week 96 were 17·8% and 13·8%, respectively (difference 4·0%, 95% CI -0·8 to 8·8). The frequency of serious or treatment-modifying adverse events were similar (10·2 vs 8·3 per 100 person-years and 3·9 vs 4·2 per 100 person-years, respectively). Interpretation Our NtRTI-sparing regimen was non-inferior to standard treatment and represents a treatment option for patients with CD4 cell counts higher than 200 cells per L.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) addresses this issue and is being introduced into diagnostic laboratories. This review gives an overview of the resistance tests currently used and explores the opportunities and challenges that NGS genotypic resistance tests will bring. Recent findings The technical challenges of NGS, such as PCR and sequence-related errors, are being addressed and various assays are currently undergoing technical validation for clinical use. Although not conclusive, the data seem to suggest that NGS will be valuable for low genetic barrier drugs and certain types of tests such as the HIV-1 tropism test. Clinical validation of the reporting and interpretation of minority variant results are essential when laboratories start reporting these results. Summary The first wave of NGS technology is being rolled out in diagnostic laboratories. Antiviral test benefits include increased sensitivity and eventually cheaper antiviral resistance tests. There is a risk that low percentage minority variants may be over interpreted. This could result in antiviral drugs, which may have been effective, being possibly denied to patients if proper clinical validation studies are not performed.;http://journals.lww.com/00001432-201412000-00016;7.3;7.0;7.1;09517375;;;

Data Sources: MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar searches (January 2000 to May 2014) were conducted for articles published in English and limited to human subjects, using the key words antiretroviral drugs, HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitors, dolutegravir, DTG, and S/GSK1349572. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Following MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar searches, 6 clinical trials were identified and included in this review. Phase III/IV studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of dolutegravir in humans were selected and evaluated. Data Synthesis: In treatment naïve and experienced patients dolutegravir was noninferior to raltegravir at suppressing viral load when added to background therapy. Abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir was noninferior to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and darunavir/ritonavir plus background therapy at suppressing viral load. In patients with multipleclass antiretroviral resistance at baseline, dolutegravir decreased HIV RNA by 1.4 log10 copies/mL at day 8, 63% of patients had achieved virologic suppression at week 8, and retained potency in treatment-experienced INSTI-resistant patients up to week 48 or 96 of follow-up. Conclusion: Dolutegravir is a safe, effective, and well-tolerated treatment option for adults with HIV-1, even in the setting of resistance to other antiretrovirals.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8755122514544126;0.3;0.4;0.7;87551225;;;

Cobicistat has a lower potential for off-target drug interactions than the standard boosting agent ritonavir, due to its more selective inhibition of CYP3A and lower likelihood for enzymatic induction, and is devoid of anti-HIV activity. When used to boost darunavir or atazanavir in healthy volunteers, oral cobicistat 150 mg once daily provided bioequivalent PI exposure to that seen with oral ritonavir 100 mg once daily (i.e. low-dose ritonavir). Moreover, in treatment-naïve adults infected with HIV-1 participating in a large, double-blind, phase III trial, an atazanavir-based antiretroviral regimen boosted with cobicistat 150 mg once daily provided a high rate of virological suppression after 48 weeks of therapy that was noninferior to that seen with low-dose ritonavir boosting. Cobicistat was generally well tolerated in this study, with a tolerability profile similar to that of ritonavir. Cobicistat may increase serum creatinine levels (possibly via inhibition of proximal renal tubular cell transporters) and thus reduce estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), although it does not appear to affect actual GFR. The drug is more soluble than ritonavir, making coformulation easier, and fixed-dose formulations combining cobicistat with darunavir and atazanavir are in development. Thus, cobicistat is an emerging alternative to ritonavir for the pharmacokinetic enhancement of PIs in adults with HIV-1 infection. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40265-013-0160-x;9.4;9.2;9.6;00126667;;;

The HIV/AIDS pandemic, and its impact on women, has prompted the investigation of multipurpose technologies, specifically, prevention strategies to protect against unwanted pregnancy and prevent the sexual transmission of HIV. Current research in multipurpose technologies is targeted to develop a discrete and long acting device, highly effective in preventing both HIV and unintended pregnancy. Significant advances in research development in contraception devices, that also prevent STDs, have occurred in the last decade. There are currently no approved MPTs on the market; however a number of fixed dose drug combination medications targeted to treat a single indication exist.

Non-invasive techniques for staging liver fibrosis, such as transient elastometry, may allow both periodic monitoring and examination of large patient populations. Methods: A programme of liver fibrosis assessment using transient elastometry has been ongoing at our institution since 2004. All HIV-HCV-coinfected patients having 2 examinations separated by >18 months were included. Liver fibrosis progression (LFP) was defined as an increase in liver stiffness from <9.5 kPa (Metavir F0-F2) to >9.5 kPa (Metavir F3-F4), or an increase >30% in patients with baseline Metavir F3-F4. Results: A total of 545 HIV-HCV-coinfected patients were analysed (mean age 41 years, 71% male, 81% intravenous drug users, mean body mass index 23.3 kg/m2, 4.2% hepatitis B surface antigen-positive, 8.4% alcohol abuse, mean CD4+ T-cell count 519 cells/l). At baseline, 527 patients were on antiretroviral therapy, with the most frequent third drug being atazanavir (19.7%), efavirenz (15.9%), lopinavir (13.1%) or nevirapine (7.2%). A total of 99 (18%) patients experienced LFP during a mean (sd) follow-up of 70.9 (15.7) months. Use of protease inhibitors (OR 4.93, 95% CI 1.73, 14.0; P=0.03) and male gender (OR 5.12, 95% CI 1.37, 19.1; P=0.01) were associated with LFP. By contrast, the achievement of HCV clearance following pegylated interferon/ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) therapy (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.1, 0.79; P=0.02) was protective. Lopinavir exposure was significantly associated with LFP (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.0, 1.04; P=0.03), whereas nevirapine was protective (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.9, 0.99; P=0.02). Conclusions: The use of protease inhibitors, mainly lopinavir, is associated with increased LFP in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients.

Dolutegravir is the first next-generation INSTI showing some novel and intriguing characteristics: it has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with a prolonged intracellular halflife, rendering feasible a once daily dosing without the need for pharmacokinetic boosting. Secondly, it is largely metabolized via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 with a minor component of cytochrome P450 isoforms, thus allowing a low grade of drug–drug interactions, so that its metabolic profile consents co-administration with the majority of the other ARV drugs without dose adjustments. Lastly, but no less important, virological studies have clearly demonstrated that dolutegravir has a significant activity against HIV-1 isolates showing raltegravir and/or elvitegravir associated resistance mutations. The attributes of once daily administration and the potential to treat INSTI-resistant viruses make dolutegravir an interesting and promising new agent in the treatment of both naïve and experienced HIV-1 subjects. In this review, the main concerns on dolutegravir efficacy are focused through the analysis of the currently available data from clinical studies in naïve and experienced patients, evaluating its possible place within the anti-HIV-1 drug armamentarium. The development of newer once daily, single tablet coformulations improved drug adherence and maximized the success of ARV therapy. Pharmacokinetic studies and dose-ranging trials suggested that dolutegravir is a good candidate for a single tablet regimen in one or more new coformulated pills that will be available in the near future. © 2014, SAGE Publications.

Several INSTIs have been developed clinically. Areas covered: The purpose of this review is to examine the safety data of the three FDA-approved INSTIs: Raltegravir (RAL), Elvitegravir (EVG) and Dolutegravir (DTG). The most relevant papers related to the safety profile of integrase inhibitors were selected and summarized. Expert opinion: INSTIs have demonstrated a favorable safety profile in Phase II and III trials. The most common clinical adverse events reported were diarrhea, nausea and headache. DTG and cobicistat, a component of Stribild™, increase serum creatinine and decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of active tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function. INSTIs intrinsic potency, together with an outstanding safety profile, preludes an important role for these drugs to build up highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) in the near future. © 2014 Informa UK, Ltd.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1517/14740338.2014.897327;6.3;6.3;6.2;14740338;;;

It is the first once-a-day therapy option containing an integrase inhibitor and cobicistat, a novel pharmacokinetic boosting agent without activity on HIV. Stribild® has demonstrated non-inferior virological efficacy and a similar recovery of CD4+ T-cells when compared to Atripla® (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir) and to ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus emtricitabine/tenofovir in two large, phase III randomized clinical trials at 48, 96, and 144 weeks. These results are consistent in all CD4+ and HIV RNA strata. Although well-tolerated, self-limiting nausea has been reported in more than 10% of patients in both trials. Cobicistat has clinically significant drug-drug interactions with drugs that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 subfamily enzymes, and causes a minimal reversible decrease of the estimated glomerular filtration rate due to inhibition of molecular transporters of creatinine in kidney tubules. Elvitegravir primary resistance mutations associated with treatment failure often lead to cross-resistance to raltegravir. © Permanyer Publications 2014.;None;4.0;3.4;3.1;11396121;;;

In treatment-naïve adults, once-daily emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF was noninferior to once-daily emtricitabine/efavirenz/tenofovir DF with regard to establishing virological suppression over 96 weeks of therapy in a randomized, open-label, phase IIIb study (STaR). These data confirmed the findings of a pooled subset analysis of two earlier 96-week, double-blind, phase III trials (ECHO and THRIVE) in which treatment-naïve adults received either rilpivirine or efavirenz in combination with emtricitabine/tenofovir DF. However, the virological benefit of emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF in this setting appeared limited in patients with low CD4+ cell counts or high viral loads at baseline. In 48-week phase IIIb (SPIRIT) and IIb (Study 111) trials in treatment-experienced patients already virologically suppressed with a single- or multiple-tablet antiretroviral regimen and without prior virological failure, switching to once-daily emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF maintained virological suppression and was noninferior to remaining on a more complex multiple-tablet regimen in this regard. Emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF is generally well tolerated and appears to have a more favourable tolerability profile than emtricitabine/efavirenz/tenofovir DF. Thus, emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF is a welcome addition to the other single-tablet regimens currently available for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, providing a convenient and effective option for some adults who are treatment-naïve, as well as those who are already virologically suppressed on their current treatment regimen and wish to switch because of intolerance or to simplify their regimen.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40265-014-0318-1;9.4;9.2;9.6;00126667;;;

Adult HIV-infected patients who started a raltegravir-containing therapy were enrolled into the study. The skeletal muscle toxicity was defined by the presence of one or more of the following parameters: (1) isolated and significant CK elevation without signs or symptoms; (2) diffuse myalgia without weakness; (3) proximal muscle weakness; (4) rhabdomyolysis. On the whole, 155 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 49.2 years; the median duration of the raltegravir treatment was 30.7 months. The overall frequency of skeletal muscle toxicity was 23.9%, with an incidence of 4.7/100 person-years. An isolated CK elevation was reported in 21.3% of cases, while less than 3% of patients complained of myalgia or muscle weakness. The CK elevation was usually of grade 1 or 2 and self-limiting, and laboratory or clinical abnormalities did not require discontinuation of raltegravir in any patient. Factors significantly associated with skeletal muscle toxicity were previous use of zidovudine, higher baseline CK levels, previous increase of the CK levels, and a higher body mass index. Skeletal muscle toxicity is not an unusual adverse event in subjects receiving raltegravir, but it is usually represented by a mild-to-moderate increase in CK concentration, while clinical symptoms of myopathy are very uncommon.";http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2014.0113;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

The strength and grade of the recommendation varies with clinical circumstances, number of CD4 cells, comorbid conditions and prevention of transmission of HIV. The objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable plasma viral load. Initial ART should always comprise a combination of 3 drugs, including 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and a third drug from a different family (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, protease inhibitor, or integrase inhibitor). This update presents the causes and criteria for switching ART in patients with undetectable plasma viral load and in cases of virological failure.

We investigated whether diminished levels of a key mitochondrial antioxidant, glutathione (GSH), was contributing to defective fatty acid oxidation in older HIV-infected patients, and if so, the metabolic mechanisms contributing to GSH deficiency in these patients. Methods: In an open-label design, 8 older GSH-deficient HIV-infected males were studied before and after 14 days of oral supplementation with the GSH precursors cysteine and glycine. A combination of stable-isotope tracers, calorimetry, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and dynamometry were used to measure GSH synthesis, fasted and insulin-stimulated (fed) mitochondrial fuel oxidation, insulin sensitivity, body composition, anthropometry, forearm-muscle strength, and lipid profiles. Results: Impaired synthesis contributed to GSH deficiency in the patients and was restored with cysteine plus glycine supplementation. GSH improvement was accompanied by marked improvements in fasted and fed mitochondrial fuel oxidation. Associated benefits included improvements in insulin sensitivity, body composition, anthropometry, muscle strength, and dyslipidemia. Conclusions: This work identifies 2 novel findings in older HIV-infected patients: 1) diminished synthesis due to decreased availability of cysteine and glycine contributes to GSH deficiency and can be rapidly corrected by dietary supplementation of these precursors and 2) correction of GSH deficiency is associated with improvement of mitochondrial fat and carbohydrate oxidation in both fasted and fed states and with improvements in insulin sensitivity, body composition, and muscle strength. The role of GSH on ameliorating metabolic complications in older HIV-infected patients warrants further investigation.

We assessed the association between adherence patterns and resistance emergence over time, using an adherence measure that distinguishes low adherence from treatment interruptions, in rural Cameroon. Methods: We performed a cohort study among patients receiving nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART in nine district hospitals, using data from the Stratall trial (2006-2010). Genotypic mutations associated with antiretroviral drug resistance were assessed when 6-monthly HIV viral loads were >5000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL. ART adherence data were collected using face-to-face questionnaires. Combined indicators of early (1-3 months) and late (6 months to t-1; t is the time point when the resistance had been detected) adherence were constructed. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox models were used to assess the association between adherence patterns and early (at 6 months) and late (after 6 months) resistance emergence, respectively. Results: Among 456 participants (71% women; median age 37 years), 45 developed HIV drug resistance (18 early and 27 late). Early low adherence (<80%) and treatment interruptions (>2 days) were associated with early resistance [adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 8.51 (1.30-55.61) and 5.25 (1.45-18.95), respectively]. Early treatment interruptions were also associated with late resistance [adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) 3.72 (1.27-10.92)].

We assessed 48-week changes in sCD14 and other inflammatory biomarkers in virologically suppressed, HIV-infected women switching to raltegravir (RAL) from a protease inhibitor (PI) or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Methods: HIV-infected women with central adiposity and HIV-1 RNA <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL continued their thymidine-sparing nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone and were randomized to switch to open-label RAL at week 0 (immediate) or 24 (delayed). In an exploratory analysis, inflammatory biomarkers were measured on stored fasting plasma. Results: Of the 37 evaluable subjects, 78% were non-White; the median age was 43 years, the median body mass index (BMI) was 32kg/m2 and the median CD4 count was 558cells/L. At baseline, biomarker values were similar between groups. After 24 weeks, median sCD14 significantly declined in subjects switching to RAL [-21% (P<0.001) vs.PI/NNRTI -5% (P=0.49); between-group P<0.01]. After 48 weeks, immediate-switch subjects maintained this decline and delayed-switch subjects experienced a similar decline following the switch to RAL (-10%; within-group P<0.01). Immediate-switch subjects also experienced an initial increase in tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- that was neither maintained after 48 weeks nor seen in delayed-switch subjects. After adjustment for multiple testing, only declines in sCD14 remained significant. Conclusions: In this randomized trial of women with central adiposity, a switch to RAL from a PI or NNRTI was associated with a statistically significant decline in sCD14. Further studies are needed to determine whether integrase inhibitors have improved monocyte activation profiles compared with PIs and/or NNRTIs, and whether measured differences between antiretroviral agents translate to demonstrable clinical benefit. © 2014 British HIV Association.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/hiv.12128;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;

However, this global effort would be even more profitable if the access to laboratory services especially in decentralized settings was strengthened. We report the virological outcome and HIV-1 drug resistance in three West African countries using dried blood spots (DBS) samples. Methods: We included HIV-1-infected adults on ART 6 months and followed up in capital cities and decentralized sites in Senegal, Mali and Guinea-Conakry. Patients were consecutively enrolled and DBS were collected in field conditions and kept at ambient temperature before transfer to the reference laboratory. Viral load (VL) was quantified using the NucliSENS EasyQ HIV-1 v1.2. Genotyping of HIV-1 pol gene was performed using in-house protocol. Results: Of the 407 participants, 119, 152 and 136 were from Senegal, Mali and Guinea-Conakry, respectively. The median treatment duration was 36 months [IQR: 6-136]. Virological failure (VF) (VL3log10 copies/mL) was observed in 26% (95% confidence interval (CI), 18-35; n=31), 11% (95% CI, 6-17; n=16) and 24% (95% CI, 17-32; n=33) of patients in Senegal, Mali and Guinea-Conakry, respectively (p=0.001). Of samples presenting VL3log10 copies/mL (n=80), 70 were successfully genotyped. At least one drug resistance mutation (DRM) was detected in the following proportions: 70% (95% CI, 50-86; n=19), 93% (95% CI, 68-100; n=14) and 68% (95% CI, 48-84; n=19) in Senegal, Mali and Guinea-Conakry, respectively (p=0.22). Twenty-six per cent (26%; 95% CI, 16-38; n=18) of patients in VF harboured wild-type viruses, which is likely indicative of weak adherence. Phylogenetic analysis showed the predominance of CRF02-AG subtype (73%; 95% CI, 61-83; n=51). Conclusions: We describe the ART outcome in capital and rural settings of Senegal, Mali and Guinea-Conakry. Our results in all of the three countries highlight the need to reinforce the ART adherence in order to minimize the occurrence of drug resistance. In addition, these findings provide additional evidence that the use of DBS as a sampling support could assist virological monitoring of patients on ART in remote areas.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.7448/IAS.17.1.19315;5.5;6.7;7.1;;19315;;

This study characterized the genotypic resistance patterns at the time of failure after at least 36 months of a first-line regimen in Mali, West Africa. Methods: Plasma samples from 84 patients who were receiving first-line antiretroviral treatment and with an HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL)>1000 copies/mL were analysed. Genotypic resistance testing was performed and HIV-1 drug resistance was interpreted according to the latest version of the National Agency for HIV and Hepatitis Research algorithm. Results: At the time of resistance testing, patients had been treated for a median of 60 months (IQR 36- 132 months) and had a median CD4 cell count of 292 cells/mm3 (IQR 6-1319 cells/mm3), a median HIV-1 RNA level of 28266 copies/mL (IQR 1000-2938495 copies/mL) and a median genotypic susceptibility score of 1 (IQR 1-4). The prevalence of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance mutations was 78% and 82%, respectively. Viruseswere resistant to at least one drug in 92% of cases. Although etravirine and rilpivirine were not used in the first-line regimens, viruses were resistant to etravirine in 34% of cases and to rilpivirine in 49% of cases. The treatment duration, median number of NRTI and NNRTI mutations and some reverse transcriptase mutations (T215Y/F/N, L210W, L74I, M41L and H221Y) were associated with the VL at virological failure. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a high level of resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs, compromising secondgeneration NNRTIs, for patients who stayed on long-term first-line regimens. It is crucial to expand the accessibility of virological testing in resource-limited settings to limit the expansion of resistance and preserve second-line treatment efficacy. © The Author 2014.

Design: A cohort audiometric study of newborns between October 2012 and April 2013. Settings: A secondary and tertiary hospital-based study. Participants: Consecutive 126 HIV-exposed and 121 HIV-unexposed newborns. Intervention: Hearing screening of the newborns was done with Auditory Brainstem Response and compared with maternal HAART, CD4<sup>+</sup> cell counts, RNA viral loads and newborn CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count percentage. Main outcome measure: Hearing threshold levels of both groups were measured and analysed. Results: Around 11.1% of HIV-exposed and 6.6% of unexposed newborns had hearing impairment (P=0.2214). About 6.4% of HIV-exposed and 2.5% HIV-unexposed newborns had hearing threshold of more than 20 dBHL (P=0.1578). There was no significant association between the hearing thresholds of HIV-exposed newborns and maternal CD4 cell counts (P=0.059) but there was with maternal viral load (P=0.034). There was significant difference between the hearing thresholds of HIVexposed newborns with CD4<sup>+</sup>% of 25 or less and more than 25. This study showed significant difference in the hearing of the 119 HAART-exposed newborns and seven unexposed newborns [P=0.002; risk ratio, 0.13 (0.05-0.32)]. Conclusion: There was a trend towards more hearing loss in HIV-exposed newborns. However, hearing thresholds increase with increasing mothers' viral load. The background information supports the need for further studies on the role of in-utero exposure to HIV and HAART in newborn hearing loss.";http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201409240-00005;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

Methods: In this study we analysed linked data from the observational UK Collaborative HIV Cohort (CHIC) Study and UK HIV Drug Resistance Database (HDRD) to investigate the rate of development of K65R or M184V resistance mutations in patients failing on combinations containing tenofovir (TDF) and efavirenz (EFV) with either 3TC or FTC. Virological failure was defined as 1 viral load >400copies/ml. Rates were stratified by demographic variables, baseline viral load, current CD4 count, current viral load and year of starting regimen. Significant associations were identified using Poisson regression models and multivariable analyses were performed adjusting for the variables above. Logistic regression was used to determine whether there were any significant associations between type of regimen and detection of resistance mutation. Results: 5455 patients received either (or both) 3TC, TDF and EFV or FTC, TDF and EFV contributing 6465 treatment episodes over 9962 person-years follow up. 47 of these episodes were preceded by resistance tests showing development of K65R or M184V mutation and were hence excluded. The majority of treatment episodes consisted of FTC- (n=5190) rather than 3TC- (n=1228) based regimens. 21 cases of K65R were detected over the course of follow up, giving an overall event rate of 0.21 (95% CI: 0.12-0.31)/100 person years follow up (PYFU). The overall event rate for detection of M184V was 0.38 (95% CI: 0.26-0.5)/100 PYFU. 201 patients receiving either regimen for the first time experienced virological failure. Of those receiving 3TC (n=53), 7 (13.2%), 12 (22.6%) and 15 (28.3%) developed K65R, M184V and either K65R or M184V respectively. Of those receiving FTC (n=148), 13 (8.8%), 20 (13.5%) and 26 (17.6%) developed K65R, M184V and either K65R or M184V respectively. Although patients on 3TC were more likely to develop resistance, this was not statistically significant in univariable (OR 1.85 (95% CI: 0.89-3.85, p=0.09)) or multivariable analyses (OR 1.89 (95% CI: 0.89-4.01, p=0.1)).

The effects of antiretrovirals on cystatin C-based renal function estimates are unknown. Methods. We analyzed changes in renal function using creatinine and cystatin C-based estimating equations in 269 patients in A5224s, a substudy of study A5202, in which treatment-naive patients were randomized to abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir/emtricitabine with open-label atazanavir/ritonavir or efavirenz. Results. Changes in renal function significantly improved (or declined less) with abacavir/lamivudine treatment compared with tenofovir/emtricitabine using the Cockcroft-Gault formula (P =.016) and 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI; P =.030) and 2012 CKD-EPI cystatin C-creatinine (P =.025). Renal function changes significantly improved (or declined less) with efavirenz compared with atazanavir/ritonavir (P <.001 for all equations). Mean (95% confidence interval) renal function changes specifically for tenofovir/emtricitabine combined with atazanavir/ritonavir were -8.3 (-14.0, -2.6) mL/min with Cockcroft-Gault; -14.9 (-19.7, -10.1) mL/min per 1.732 with Modification of Diet in Renal Disease; -12.8 (-16.5, -9.0) mL/min per 1.732 with 2009 CKD-EPI; +8.9 (4.2, 13.7) mL/min per 1.732 with 2012 CKD-EPI cystatin C; and -1.2 (-5.1, 2.6) mL/min per 1.732 with 2012 CKD-EPI cystatin C-creatinine. Renal function changes for the other treatment arms were more favorable but similarly varied by estimating equation. Conclusions.

Even with effective antiretroviral treatment, residual activation persists. We hypothesized that an oral probiotic could improve the residual immune activation in chronic treated HIV-1 infection, and tested a Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086 capsule probiotic in HIV-1-infected persons with suppressed viremia on stable antiretroviral therapy in a 3-month double-blind placebo-controlled trial (10 probiotic, 7 placebo). The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) was administered monthly. Blood was tested at the start and end of placebo/probiotic administration for viremia, CD4+ T cell percentage/concentration, soluble (s)CD14, soluble intestinal fatty acid binding protein, sCD163, D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-. All participants maintained viremia <40 RNA copies/ml. The probiotic was safe and well tolerated, and appeared to improve chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Its administration was associated with a significant increase in the percentage of blood CD4+ T cells compared to placebo (+2.8% versus -1.8%, p=0.018) although CD4+ T cell concentrations were generally unchanged in both groups. None of the biomarkers showed significant changes on probiotic treatment or between-group differences in change (although significance was borderline for a greater sCD163 drop in the probiotic versus placebo group, p=0.05). Some biomarkers showed significant correlations to each other, particularly D-dimer with CRP and sCD14 with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-. These data demonstrate the safety and possible benefit of this probiotic for residual inflammation in treated HIV-1 infection, although further study will be required to determine the immune pathways involved.;http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2014.0181;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

Aims of the present study were to evaluate the prevalence of these RAMs in Italian HIV-1 infected patients and to assess if previous drug history could represent a risk to develop RPV-related RAMs. The analysis was performed using the ARCA database, which contains data on resistance and therapy from subjects throughout Italy. Prevalence of RPV-associated and first-generation NNRTI-associated RAMs was evaluated. Linear regression model, odds ratio and 95% Confidence Interval were used to assess factors associated with the development of RPV RAMs, substitutions at position 184 and their combinations. A total of 8,067 tests were selected within the database. In Italian HIV-positive HAART-naïve patients, prevalence of the main RAMs for RPV is low except for E138A (present in 5.1% of subjects). The combination E138K+M184I is absent in both naïve and experienced subjects. A previous exposure to NVP might increase the risk to develop RPV-associated RAMs. TDF, EFV, and possibly FTC may predispose to the selection for M184I. Among Italian patients the susceptibility to RPV is widespread since some severe substitutions (e.g., E138K are rare), whereas issues exist for others (i.e., E138A, Y181C) which are more frequent. Appropriate use of RPV within a therapeutic sequencing might be controversial. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/jmv.23978;3.8;3.9;4.0;01466615;;;

The limited access to virological monitoring in developing countries is a major weakness of the current antiretroviral treatment (ART) strategy in these settings. We conducted a large cross-sectional study in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Togo, Thailand, and Vietnam to assess virological failure and drug resistance mutations (DRMs) after 12 or 24 months of ART.Methods. Between 2009 and 2011, we recruited adults attending ART centers 10-14 months (the M12 group) or 22-26 months (M24 group) after initiating ART. Demographic and clinical data were collected on site, and viral load was measured. Samples with a viral load of  1000 copies/mL, considered as the failure threshold, were genotyped for drug resistance assessment.Results. Overall, 3935 patients were recruited (2060 at M12 and 1875 at M24). Median ages varied from 32 to 42 years. Median CD4+ T-cell counts at ART initiation were low (99-172 cells/L). The main ART regimens included stavudine/zidovudine plus lamivudine plus nevirapine/efavirenz. Overall, virological failure frequency was 11.1% for M12 patients and 12.4% for M24 patients, and 71.0% to 86.1% of these patients, respectively, had drug-resistant virus. Across sites, virological failure varied from 2.9% to 20.6% in M12 patients and from 3.7% to 26.0% in M24 patients. Predominant DRMs were associated with ART regimens, but virus in several patients accumulated DRMs to drugs not received, such as abacavir, didanosine, tenofovir, etravirine, and rilpivirine.Conclusions. Our findings show heterogeneous virological failure and illustrate that, in addition to routine access to viral load, good management of ART programs is even more critical to improve treatment outcomes in resource-limited countries. © 2013 The Author.;https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/cid/cit627;14.0;13.8;12.5;10584838;;;

We explored the safety and efficacy of raltegravir as an alternative to efavirenz for patients co-infected with HIV and tuberculosis. Methods: We did a multicentre, phase 2, non-comparative, open-label, randomised trial at eight sites in Brazil and France. Using a computer-generated randomisation sequence, we randomly allocated antiretroviral-naive adult patients with HIV-1 and tuberculosis (aged 18 years with a plasma HIV RNA concentration of >1000 copies per mL) to receive raltegravir 400 mg twice a day, raltegravir 800 mg twice daily, or efavirenz 600 mg once daily plus tenofovir and lamivudine (1:1:1; stratified by country). Patients began study treatment after the start of tuberculosis treatment. The primary endpoint was virological suppression at 24 weeks (HIV RNA <50 copies per mL) in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug (modified intention-to-treat analysis). We recorded death, study drug discontinuation, and loss to follow-up as failures to achieve the primary endpoint. We assessed safety in all patients who received study drugs. This study is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00822315. Findings: Between July 3, 2009, and June 6, 2011, we enrolled and randomly assigned treatment to 155 individuals; 153 (51 in each group) received at least one dose of the study drug and were included in the primary analysis. 133 patients (87%) completed follow-up at week 48. At week 24, virological suppression was achieved in 39 patients (76%, 95% CI 65-88) in the raltegravir 400 mg group, 40 patients (78%, 67-90) in the raltegravir 800 mg group, and 32 patients (63%, 49-76) in the efavirenz group. The adverse-event profile was much the same across the three groups. Three (6%) patients allocated to efavirenz and three (6%) patients allocated to raltegravir 800 mg twice daily discontinued the study drugs due to adverse events. Seven patients died during the study (one in the raltegravir 400 mg group, four in the raltegravir 800 mg group, and two in the efavirenz group): none of the deaths was deemed related to study treatment. Interpretation: Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily might be an alternative to efavirenz for the treatment of patients co-infected with HIV and tuberculosis.

However ARV activity remains difficult to assess in this context. The aim of our study was to precisely assess the ARV backbone activity in patients with undetectable viraemia who underwent raltegravir switching strategies and to evaluate the efficacy of such switching strategies based on the genotypic sensitivity score (GSS). Methods: Patients with a plasma human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA level of <50 copies/mL on a stable two ARV-class regimen were enrolled if they switched one of their ARV drugs to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily. The GSS was calculated using a genotyping test performed on the HIV-1 RNA of the last plasma measurement with a HIV-1 RNA level of >50 copies/mL before the switch and on the results of all previous genotyping tests. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a plasma HIV-1 RNA level of <50 copies/mL at week 24. Results: Fifty-six patients were enrolled in this study. The proportion of patients with a plasma HIV-1 RNA level of <50 copies/mL at week 24 was 92.9 % (range 83.0-97.2 %) in the intent-to-treat analysis and 98.1 % (90.0-99.7 %) in per-protocol analysis. When the backbone was fully active, the proportion was 100.0 % (86.7-100.0 %) at week 24 and week 48 in the per-protocol analysis. We observed a decrease in plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides of -12.7 % (p = 0.005) and -26.5 % (p = 0.001), respectively. Conclusions: Raltegravir switching strategies are effective when the associated backbone is fully active according to the GSS. In the context of undetectable viraemia, where ARV activity remains difficult to assess, the determination of the GSS requires the entire ARV history of the patient and all previous HIV-RNA genotyping test results. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s15010-013-0542-8;4.6;4.2;4.9;03008126;;;

Transcriptionally silent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) DNA persists in resting memory CD4+ T cells despite antiretroviral therapy. In a primary cell model, the antialcoholism drug disulfiram has been shown to induce HIV-1 transcription in latently infected resting memory CD4+ T cells at concentrations achieved in vivo.Methods. We conducted a single-arm pilot study to evaluate whether 500 mg of disulfiram administered daily for 14 days to HIV-1-infected individuals on stable suppressive antiretroviral therapy would result in reversal of HIV-1 latency with a concomitant transient increase in residual viremia or depletion of the latent reservoir in resting memory CD4+ T cells.Results. Disulfiram was safe and well tolerated. There was a high level of subject-to-subject variability in plasma disulfiram levels. The latent reservoir did not change significantly (1.16-fold change; 95% confidence interval [CI],. 70- to 1.92-fold; P =. 56). During disulfiram administration, residual viremia did not change significantly compared to baseline (1.53-fold; 95% CI,. 88- to 2.69-fold; P =. 13), although residual viremia was estimated to increase by 1.88-fold compared to baseline during the postdosing period (95% CI, 1.03- to 3.43-fold; P =. 04). In a post hoc analysis, a rapid and transient increase in viremia was noted in a subset of individuals (n = 6) with immediate postdose sampling (HIV-1 RNA increase, 2.96-fold; 95% CI, 1.29- to 6.81-fold; P =. 01).Conclusions. Administration of disulfiram to patients on antiretroviral therapy does not reduce the size of the latent reservoir. A possible dose-related effect on residual viremia supports future studies assessing the impact of higher doses on HIV-1 production. Disulfiram affects relevant signaling pathways and can be safely administered, supporting future studies of this drug. © 2013 The Author 2013.

To assess the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance and subtypes in Honghe of Yunnan, China, patient plasmas from ART-failed individuals were collected from January 2010 to December 2012. Genotyping was conducted using an in-house assay on patient plasmas. A total of 254 pol sequences were obtained. The prevalence of drug resistance was 47.2% in ART-failed individuals. Of these drug-resistant individuals, 51.7% harbored HIV strains dually resistant to NRTIs and NNRTIs or protease inhibitors (PIs) (34.2% for NNRTIs and 14.2% for NRTIs). Mutations such as M184V, A62V, T69Ins, K103N, Y181C, and G190A were common among the ART-failed individuals. The frequencies of M184V, A62V, and K103N were 20.5%, 11.0%, and 23.6%, respectively. The most common subtypes in Honghe were CRF08-BC (68.50%) and CRF07-BC (12.20%). The subtypes were almost consistent in different time points for one individual. When receiving ART for 6-12 months, the frequency of HIV-1 drug-resistant variants ranked first. This study shows that the high prevalence of HIV drug resistance observed among the ART-failed individuals should be of increasing concern (monitoring of resistance mutations) in ART regions and facilitate developing novel strategies for prevention and control of HIV infection in China.;http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2014.0348;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

Design: We performed a large retrospective study to determine the number of treatment failures that could have been prevented by implementing minority drug-resistant HIV-1 variant analyses in ART-naýve patients in whom no NNRTI resistance mutations were detected by routine resistance testing. Methods: Of 1608 patients in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, who have initiated first-line ART with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one NNRTI before July 2008, 519 patients were eligible by means of HIV-1 subtype, viral load and sample availability. Key NNRTI drug resistance mutations K103N and Y181C were measured by allele-specific PCR in 208 of 519 randomly chosen patients. Results: Minority K103N and Y181C drug resistance mutations were detected in five out of 190 (2.6%) and 10 out of 201 (5%) patients, respectively. Focusing on 183 patients for whom virologic success or failure could be examined, virologic failure occurred in seven out of 183 (3.8%) patients; minority K103N and/or Y181C variants were present prior to ART initiation in only two of those patients. The NNRTI-containing, first-line ART was effective in 10 patients with preexisting minority NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 variant. Conclusion: As revealed in settings of case-control studies, minority NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 variants can have an impact on ART. However, the implementation of minority NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 variant analysis in addition to genotypic resistance testing (GRT) cannot be recommended in routine clinical settings. Additional associated risk factors need to be discovered.";http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201409240-00006;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

Early infant diagnosis with rapid access to treatment has been found to reduce HIV-associated infant mortality and morbidity considerably. In line with international standards, current South African guidelines advocate routine HIV-1 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at 6 weeks of age for all HIV-exposed infants and 'fast-track' entry into the HIV treatment programme for those who test positive. Importantly, testing occurs within the context of increasing efforts at prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) by means of maternal and infant antiretroviral therapy (ART). In addition, infants already initiated on combination ART (cART) may be retested with PCR assays for 'confirmatory' purposes, including assessment prior to adoption. The potential for cART to compromise the sensitivity of HIV-1 PCR assays has been described, although there are limited and conflicting data regarding the effect of PMTCT regimens on HIV-1 PCR diagnostic sensitivity. Methods. We describe a case series of three infants with different ART exposures in whom HIV diagnosis, confirmation or the result of retesting for adoption purposes were uncertain. Results. These cases demonstrate that ART can be associated with a loss of detectability of HIV, leading to 'false-negative' HIV-1 PCR results in infants on cART. Furthermore, current PMTCT practices may lead to repeatedly indeterminate results with a subsequent delay in initiation of cART. Conclusion. The sensitivity of HIV-1 PCR assays needs to be re-evaluated within the context of different ART exposures, and diagnostic algorithms should be reviewed accordingly.;http://www.samj.org.za/index.php/samj/article/view/8322;1.9;1.8;1.8;02569574;;;

An evaluation of patients receiving first-line antiretroviral therapy in a multicountry PEPFAR program (RV288) was performed to determine the rates and predictors of virologic suppression. Resistance data from treatment failures are available from Uganda and Nigeria. Each country enrolled 325 subjects into this cross-sectional study. Subjects on first-line therapy were randomly selected for HIV RNA testing (viral load). Regimens included efavirenz or nevirapine with zidovudine/lamivudine or tenofovir/lamivudine. VL was determined from plasma using the Roche COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test, High Pure System v1.0 (47 copies/ml). Genotypic resistance testing was performed on samples with VL>1,000 copies/ml. From Uganda, 85% of subjects were undetectable while 7% (23/325) had VL>1,000 copies/ml. The HIV-1 subtype distribution was as follows: A=47.6%, C=14.3%, and D=38.1%. No resistance mutations were found in 14% of subjects. All subjects with resistance had the M184V mutation. Of subjects failing a zidovudine regimen less than 1 year, 88% (7/8) had no thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs), compared to 50% (4/8) failing greater than 1 year. Four subjects (25%) had more than two mutations from the TAM-1 pathway (41L, 210W, 215Y). In Nigeria, 82% were undetectable while 14% (45/325) had VL>1,000 copies/ml. HIV-1 subtype distribution was as follows: 62.8%=CRF02-AG, 34%=pure G, and 2.8%=A. Of the 35 genotyped subjects, 14% (5/35) had no resistance mutations. Of the remainder, 10% (3/30) had no nucleoside analogue mutations while 33% (10/30) had only M184V along with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations. Forty percent (10/25) of subjects on zidovudine failed without TAMs. Another 25% (5/25) of subjects failing on zidovudine had more than two TAM-1 mutations. Individuals failing first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) may retain sensitivity to one or more nucleoside analogues from the regimen. Knowledge of drug resistance patterns allow for selection of drugs that can be recycled in future regimens. Accumulation of resistance mutations may compromise future treatment options. © 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.;http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2013.0294;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

Dolutegravir (DTG) is the most recently approved integrase inhibitor. It displays attractive properties such as one pill once daily (QD) dosing, high barrier to resistance and clean safety profile. Moreover, it is planned to be marketed, co-formulated with abacavir (ABC) and lamivudine (3TC) as a single-tablet regimen (STR). The availability of this QD single pill represents a significant step further for a large number of HIV-infected persons. Areas covered: Updated summary of evidence-based information on efficacy and safety of DTG along with ABC and 3TC. All information available on antiretrovirals in the most advanced stages of clinical development reported in peer-reviewed journals or at international meetings has been reviewed. Expert opinion: The combination of DTG, ABC and 3TC displays a high efficacy, superior to many other antiretroviral combinations, including other convenient STR. The good safety profile, low potential for drug interactions and high resistance barrier of DTG-ABC-3TC are unique features than make this co-formulation the preferred choice as HIV therapy in multiple clinical scenarios, including most treatment-naïve and treatment- experienced patients, as part of switch strategies, and in patients with underlying serious medical conditions such as kidney abnormalities, liver disease, metabolic disturbances or neuropsychiatric conditions. © 2014 Informa UK, Ltd.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1517/14656566.2014.913023;5.7;5.6;4.9;14656566;;;

Study Design: An observational study. Place and Duration of Study: Teaching Hospital of Khyber Medical University, Institute of Medical Sciences, Kohat, from February 2007 to December 2012. Methodology: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive patients, taking 1st line ARV agents for at least 6 months were included. Adherence was calculated by self report on asking the number of doses missed in last 30 days. ARVs were provided on monthly basis. Adherence data was noted over a period of 6 months. ARVs outcomes were recorded in the form of adherence, CD4 count, functional status of the patient, change in weight, further transmission of the disease, number of hospital admissions and deaths. Adverse Drug Reactions (ARDs) to ARVs were assessed clinically and by laboratory markers. Mean and standard deviation were calculated for numerical variables while frequencies and percentages were calculated for categorical variables. Results: Total number of patients included in this study were 107. Out of them, 66.4% were males and 33.6% were females. The mean age was 39.9 ± 13.80 years. Patients taking AZT/3TC/NVP, AZT/3TC/EFZ, D4T/3TC/NVP, D4T/3TC/EFZ, TNF/3TC/NVP or EFZ were 49.5%, 22.4%, 10.3%, 4.7% and 13% respectively. Most adverse affects were observed in 10 days to 90 days of initiation of therapy. Rash was observed in 71 (66.4%) patients, anaemia in 4 (3.7%) patients while only one patient (0.93%) had nausea / vomiting. Thirty (28%) patients reported no side effects. Out of 107 patients, 98 (91.5%) were alive whereas 9 (8.4%) died at the end of the study period. Twelve patients had one hospital admission (11.21%) whereas 9 (8.4%) patients had two admissions during the study period. The first mean CD4 was 325.27 cells /mcL whereas mean last CD4 count was 389.86 cells/mcL.

BioPlex, ELISA, and nephelometric procedures were used to measure plasma levels of inflammatory biomarkers in HIV-1 subtype C-infected patients sampled before and after 6 months of successful HAART (n=20); in patients failing HAART (n=30); and in uninfected controls (n=8). Prior to HAART, CXCL9, CXCL10, 2M, sTNF-R1, TGF-1, IFN-, IL-6, TNF, and sCD14 were significantly elevated in HIV-1-infected patients compared to controls (P<0.01). All of these markers, with the exception of sTNF-R1, were also elevated in patients failing HAART (P<0.05). The persistently elevated levels of CXCL9, CXCL10, and 2M in patients failing therapy in the setting of a marked reduction in these markers in patients on successful HAART suggest that they may be useful not only to monitor immune activation during HAART, but also to distinguish between good and poor responders. In the case of sCD14 and TGF-1, the levels of these biomarkers remained persistently elevated despite HAART-induced virological suppression, a finding that is consistent with ongoing monocyte-macrophage activation, underscoring a potential role for adjuvant anti-inflammatory therapy. © 2014 Glen Malherbe et al.";http://www.hindawi.com/journals/mi/2014/198413/;6.0;6.4;6.0;09629351;198413;;

Most recommendations specific to women in current guidelines relate to pregnant women or women wishing to become pregnant. The purpose of this systematic review is to provide clinicians with an overview of available literature regarding the use of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r) in women. Methods: The online databases PubMed and EMBASE, HIV-related conference abstracts and reference lists of relevant articles were searched according to predefined terms and limited to items published from 1 October 2007 to 1 October 2012. Updates to conference presentations were checked for substantive journal publication up to 28 November 2013. Results: Of the 294 initial citations retrieved, manual selection identified 19 relevant publications describing gender-based analyses of ATV/r. Publications describing gender-based differences in efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions and adherence are critically evaluated. Conclusions: As part of a combination antiretroviral therapy regimen, ATV/r appears to be a safe, effective and durable option for treatment-naive and early treatment-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection, including non-pregnant and pregnant women. ©2014 International Medical Press.;http://www.intmedpress.com/journals/avt/abstract.cfm?id=2742&pid=48;4.4;4.1;3.9;13596535;;;

It is suitable for once-daily administration and achieves therapeutic concentrations without the need for pharmacokinetic boosting. It has a high barrier to resistance and is generally active against viral strains resistant to first-generation integrase inhibitors. In well-designed clinical trials in treatment-naive or treatment-experienced, integrase inhibitor-naive patients, dolutegravir-based combinations were shown to be noninferior or superior to raltegravir-based combinations, an efavirenz-based combination and ritonavir-boosted darunavir-based combinations with respect to virological suppression (plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) at week 48. Dolutegravir was also effective in a high proportion of patients failing on raltegravir- or elvitegravir-based therapy as a result of integrase resistance mutations. Dolutegravir was generally well tolerated, with the vast majority of adverse events being mild or moderate in intensity; serious adverse events were uncommon. Therefore, dolutegravir is an important new addition to the expanding list of antiretroviral drugs for treating HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40265-014-0256-y;9.4;9.2;9.6;00126667;;;

Longer-term comparisons between settings have been limited by poor ascertainment of mortality in high burden African settings. This study aimed to compare mortality up to four years on ART between South Africa, Europe, and North America.Data from four South African cohorts in which patients lost to follow-up (LTF) could be linked to the national population register to determine vital status were combined with data from Europe and North America. Cumulative mortality, crude and adjusted (for characteristics at ART initiation) mortality rate ratios (relative to South Africa), and predicted mortality rates were described by region at 0–3, 3–6, 6–12, 12–24, and 24–48 months on ART for the period 2001–2010. Of the adults included (30,467 [South Africa], 29,727 [Europe], and 7,160 [North America]), 20,306 (67%), 9,961 (34%), and 824 (12%) were women. Patients began treatment with markedly more advanced disease in South Africa (median CD4 count 102, 213, and 172 cells/µl in South Africa, Europe, and North America, respectively). High early mortality after starting ART in South Africa occurred mainly in patients starting ART with CD4 count <50 cells/µl. Cumulative mortality at 4 years was 16.6%, 4.7%, and 15.3% in South Africa, Europe, and North America, respectively. Mortality was initially much lower in Europe and North America than South Africa, but the differences were reduced or reversed (North America) at longer durations on ART (adjusted rate ratios 0.46, 95% CI 0.37–0.58, and 1.62, 95% CI 1.27–2.05 between 24 and 48 months on ART comparing Europe and North America to South Africa). While bias due to under-ascertainment of mortality was minimised through death registry linkage, residual bias could still be present due to differing approaches to and frequency of linkage.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001718;14.1;15.5;15.5;15491277;;;

The number of individuals receiving free HAART increased dramatically from June 2010 under the Guangxi Government's anti-HIV programme. We aimed to determine the prevalence of HIV-transmitted drug resistance (TDR) of Guangxi. Methods: HIV-positive, antiretroviral-naive individuals were recruited from the east (Hezhou), south (Qinzhou), west (Baise), north (Guilin) and centre (Laibin) of Guangxi. The pol gene of the virus from the individuals was analysed. Results: The overall prevalence of HIV TDR was 3.2% (7/216, 95% CI 0.9-5.5). The prevalence rates in Baise, Guilin, Hezhou, Qinzhou and Laibin are 4.9% (2/41, 95% CI -1.7 to 11.5), 2.3% (1/44, 95% CI -2.1 to 5.7), 4.7% (2/43, 95% CI -1.6 to 11.0), 2.6% (1/38, 95% CI -2.5 to 7.7) and 2.0% (1/50, 95% CI -1.9 to 5.9), respectively. No significant difference in the prevalence was found among them. No factors were found to be associated with TDR, including CD4 cell counts, viral loads and genotypes. The subtypes CRF01-AE, CRF07-BC, CRF08-BC and B were found. Subtype CRF08-BC is the predominant subtype in Baise while CRF01-AE is the predominant subtype elsewhere in Guangxi. Conclusions: The prevalence of TDR in antiretroviral-naive patients in Guangxi remains low 8 years after scale-up of HAART. © 2014 S.

Two partially blind, randomized, Phase IIb studies were initiated (1 in treatment-naive and 1 in treatment-experienced subjects with HIV) to select a once-daily dose of fosdevirine for Phase III trials. Methods: In the SIGNET study, treatment-naive subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to receive once-daily fosdevirine 100 or 200 mg or efavirenz 600 mg, each along with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine 300 mg/200 mg or abacavir/lamivudine 600 mg/300 mg. In the SONNET study, treatment-experienced subjects with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant HIV-1 were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with fosdevirine 100 or 200 mg once daily or etravirine 200 mg twice daily, each along with twice-daily darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg and raltegravir 400 mg. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA<50 copies/ml. Safety and pharmacokinetics were also addressed. Results: A total of 35 subjects were exposed to fosdevirine 100 or 200 mg. Trials were halted when 5 treatment-experienced subjects (1 receiving fosdevirine 100 mg, 4 receiving fosdevirine 200 mg) developed new-onset seizures after  4 weeks of exposure to fosdevirine. There was no clear association between seizures and fosdevirine plasma drug levels. Time to seizure onset ranged from 28 to 81 days, and all 5 subjects experienced  1 seizure after drug discontinuation. Conclusions: The delayed onset of seizures after fosdevirine exposure and persistence after discontinuation is without precedent in antiretroviral drug development, leading to additional investigation and underscoring the need for careful subject monitoring. ©2014 International Medical Press.;http://www.intmedpress.com/journals/avt/abstract.cfm?id=2689&pid=48;4.4;4.1;3.9;13596535;;;

Methods: For this narrative review, literature searches have been performed in PubMed, IndexRevMed and Cochrane, using the search terms HIV, single-tablet, one-pill, single dose, fixed-dose, and STR. These have been reviewed and complemented with the most recent publications of interest. Results: Fixed-dose combinations are a significant advance in antiretroviral treatment simplification, contributing to an increase in compliance with complex chronic therapies, thus improving patients' quality of life. Reducing the number of pills and daily doses is associated with higher adherence and better quality of life. As a fixed-dose combination tablet given once daily, EFV/FTC/TDF was the first available STR combining efficacy, tolerability and convenience, with the simplest dosing schedule and smallest numbers of pills of any ART combination therapy. The RPV/FTC/TDF is a next-generation NNRTI-based STR, a once daily complete ART regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Recently the combination of EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF was also approved by the European Commission, and is the first integrase inhibitor-based STR. Receiving antiretroviral therapy as once daily STR is associated with both clinical and economic benefits, which confirms previous research. Conclusions: The associated benefits of STRs provide a valid strategy for the treatment of HIV-infected patients. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1185/03007995.2013.844685;4.9;4.1;3.8;03007995;;;

Mutations accumulate in the HIV genome and make certain drugs ineffective. Prediction of resistance from genotype data is a valuable guide in choice of drugs for effective therapy. Results: In order to improve the computational prediction of resistance from genotype data we have developed a unified encoding of the protein sequence and three-dimensional protein structure of the drug target for classification and regression analysis. The method was tested on genotype-resistance data for mutants of HIV protease and reverse transcriptase. Our graph based sequence-structure approach gives high accuracy with a new sparse dictionary classification method, as well as support vector machine and artificial neural networks classifiers. Cross-validated regression analysis with the sparse dictionary gave excellent correlation between predicted and observed resistance. Conclusion: The approach of encoding the protein structure and sequence as a 210-dimensional vector, based on Delaunay triangulation, has promise as an accurate method for predicting resistance from sequence for drugs inhibiting HIV protease and reverse transcriptase.;http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-15-S5-S1;7.2;6.6;6.0;;S1;;

Methods: NORA [Nevirapine OR Abacavir study, a sub-study of the Development of AntiRetroviral Therapy in Africa (DART) trial] randomized 600 symptomatic HIV-infected Ugandan adults (CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm. 3) to receive zidovudine/lamivudine plus abacavir (cABC arm) or nevirapine (cNVP arm). All virological tests were performed retrospectively, including resistance tests on week 96 plasma samples with HIV RNA levels 1000 copies/mL. Phenotypic resistance was expressed as fold-change in IC. 50 (FC) relative to wild-type virus. Results: HIV-1 RNA viral load 1000 copies/mL at week 96 was seen in 58/204 (28.4%) cABC participants and 21/159 (13.2%) cNVP participants. Resistance results were available in 35 cABC and 17 cNVP participants; 31 (89%) cABC and 16 (94%) cNVP isolates had a week 96 FC below the biological cut-off for tenofovir (2.2). In the cNVP arm, 16/17 participants had resistance mutations synonymous with high-level resistance to nevirapine and efavirenz; FC values for etravirine were above the biological cut-off in 9 (53%) isolates. In multivariate regression models, K65R, Y115F and the presence of thymidine analogue-associated mutations were associated with increased susceptibility to etravirine in the cABC arm. Conclusions: Our data support the use of tenofovir following failure of a first-line zidovudine-containing regimen and shed further light on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor hypersusceptibility. © The Author 2014.

Mean±SD tenofovir concentration in ABCC2*1C genotype CC versus CT/TT was 113±47 versus 93±44 ng/mL, respectively (P=0.018). By multivariate analysis I, decreased eGFR at week 48 was correlated to ABCC2*1C genotype CC (P=0.001), low eGFR at baseline (P=0.006) and older age (P=0.048). By multivariate analysis II, decreased eGFR at week 48 was correlated to high plasma tenofovir concentration (P=0.001) and low eGFR at baseline (P=0.019). Conclusions: HIV-infected patients who carry ABCC2*1C genotype CC at position -24 or have high plasma tenofovir concentration are at risk of decreased glomerular filtration rate. © The Author 2014.

Commercial genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing is even more costly, yet it provides important benefits. Objectives: We sought to determine the sensitivity and negative predictive value of a qualitative PCR targeting partial reverse transcriptase for detection of virologic failure when 5 patient specimens are pooled. Study design: A total of 300 South African routine patient samples were included and tested in 60 pools of 5 samples each. A qualitative nested PCR was optimised for testing pools and individual samples from positive pools. All positive samples were sequenced to detect drug resistance-associated mutations. Results were compared to those of conventional viral load monitoring. Results: Twenty-two of 60 pools tested positive. Individual testing yielded 29 positive individual samples. Twenty-six patients had viral loads of above 1000 copies/ml. The pooling algorithm detected 24 of those 26 patients, resulting in a negative predictive value of 99.3%, and a positive predictive value of 89.7%. The sensitivity for detecting patients failing therapy was 92%, with a specificity of 98.9%. Of the patients failing first-line ART, 83.3% had NRTI and 91.7% NNRTI resistance mutations. Conclusions: The pooled testing algorithm presented here required 43% fewer assays than conventional viral load testing. In addition to offering a potential cost saving over individual viral load testing, it also provided drug resistance information which is not available routinely in resourced-limited settings. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1386653214001887;5.7;6.0;5.9;13866532;;;

However, the emergence of resistant mutants has become one of the biggest challenges in HIV-1 RT drug discovery/development and attracted great research interests worldwide. It is particularly important to develop novel anti-HIV-1 RT agents that have improved potency and efficacy against the wild-type (WT) RT, but also target resistant RT forms. Previous crystal complex structures of HIV-1 RT revealed the interaction mechanism between the enzyme and inhibitors, which promoted the exploitation of inhibitor that had sufficient conformational flexibility to combat resistance. Hence, the potential flexibility of a drug should be part of the strategy considered in the early stages of designing drugs that are intended to be broadly effective against mutated targets associated with drug resistance. This review provides an overview of the state of the art in this field, including design strategies and challenges for medicinal chemists. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.;http://www.eurekaselect.com/openurl/content.php?genre=article&issn=1381-6128&volume=20&issue=5&spage=725;5.8;5.3;5.1;13816128;;;

Rilpivirine was developed in an effort to generate patient-tailored drugs with high convenience and minimal side effects. By now, rilpivirine is currently licensed for use with other antiretroviral agents, and as a single agent or a singletablet regimen with tenofovir and emtricitabine , in antiretroviral-naive, HIV-1-infected adults with < 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml because of a higher rate of virological failure above this level. However, after its introduction several questions remained to be elucidated, such as the efficacy of rilpivirine with abacavir/lamivudine, or its use in switching strategies, a useful alternative for patients with toxicity or intolerance. Cumulative data suggest the efficacy and safety of the combination of abacavir/lamivudine plus rilpivirine in the clinical setting, and an increasing number of patients received rilpivirine after protease inhibitor, efavirenz, or nevirapine-based therapy without compromising rilpivirine exposure after the change. Moreover, rilpivirine is a substrate and weak inducer of the CYP3A4, but there are no significant pharmacokinetic interactions with new anti-hepatitis C compounds such as telaprevir, simeprevir, daclatasvir, ledipasvir, and sofosbuvir, an important issue for a drug with low risk of hepatoxicity. As a new and promising strategy, rilpivirine has been evaluated with darunavir and dolutegravir in dual therapies, without need of dose adjustment and with adequate preliminary data. Therefore, to date, new data on rilpivirine confirm the good results observed in the clinical trials.;None;4.0;3.4;3.1;11396121;;;

Methods: ART-naïve women initiating cART between January 2000/June 2010 at the Instituto de Pesquisa Clínica Evandro Chagas Cohort were studied. Women were defined as postmenopausal after 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea. CD4 cell counts and HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL) measurements were compared between pre- and postmenopausal at 6, 12 and 24 months after cART initiation. Women who modified/discontinued a drug class or died due to an AIDS defining illness were classified as ART-failures. Variables were compared using Wilcoxon test, 2 or Fisher's exact test. The odds of cART effectiveness (VL<400 copies/mL and/or no need to change cART) were compared using logistic regression. Linear model was used to access relationship between CD4 change and menopause. Results: Among 383 women, 328 (85%) were premenopausal and 55 (15%) postmenopausal. Median pre cART CD4 counts were 231 and 208 cells/mm3 (p= 0.14) in pre- and postmenopausal women, respectively. No difference in the median pre cART VL was found (both 4.8 copies/mL). Median CD4 changes were similar at 6 and 12 months. At 24 months after cART initiation, CD4 changes among postmenopausal women were significantly lower among premenopausal women (p= 0.01). When the analysis was restricted to women with VL<400 copies/mL, no statistical difference was observed. Overall, 63.7% achieved cART effectiveness at 24 months without differences between groups at 6, 12 and 24 months. Conclusion: Menopause status at the time of first-line cART initiation does not impact CD4 cell changes at 24 months among women with a virologic response. No relationship between menopause status and virologic response was observed. © 2014 Calvet et al.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0089299;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e89299;;

We aimed to evaluate treatment responses to atazanavir plus ritonavir (ATV/r) or efavirenz (EFV) in initial antiretroviral regimens among women and men, and determine if treatment outcomes differ by sex.Methods. We performed a randomized trial of open-label ATV/r or EFV combined with abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) or tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) in 1857 human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected, treatment-naive persons enrolled between September 2005 and November 2007 at 59 sites in the United States and Puerto Rico. Associations of sex with 3 primary study endpoints of time to virologic failure, safety, and tolerability events were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. Model-based population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM version VII).Results. Of 1857 participants, 322 were women. Women assigned to ATV/r had a higher risk of virologic failure with either nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone than women assigned to EFV, or men assigned to ATV/r. The effects of ATV/r and EFV upon safety and tolerability risk did not differ significantly by sex. With ABC/3TC, women had a significantly higher (32%) safety risk compared to men; with TDF/FTC, the safety risk was 20% larger for women compared to men, but not statistically significant. Women had slower ATV clearance and higher predose levels of ATV compared to men. Self-reported adherence did not differ significantly by sex.Conclusions. This is the first randomized clinical trial to identify a significantly earlier time to virologic failure in women randomized to ATV/r compared to women randomized to EFV. This finding has important clinical implications given that boosted protease inhibitors are often favored over EFV in women of childbearing potential.Clinical Trials Registration NCT00118898. © 2013 The Author 2013.

Design: Longitudinal study which involved 265 HIV patients without DM, receiving first (nZ71) and advanced lines of antiretroviral therapy (nZ194). Methods: Prevalence of IR according to clinical and anthropometric variables, including dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan evaluation. IR was defined as homeostasis model assessment of IR 3.8. Incident DM was assessed during the follow-up. Results: First-line patients had a short time of HIV infection, less hepatitis C virus coinfection, and received mainly an efavirenz-based regimen. Overall, the prevalence of IR was 21% (55 patients, 6% in first-line, 27% in pretreated). In a logistic regression analysis, significant associations were found between the waist/hip circumference ratio (RR 10; 95% CI 1.66-16; P<0.01, per unit), and central fat in percentage (RR 1.08; 95% CI 1.01-1.17; P=0.04, per unit) as evaluated by DXA, and IR. During 770.8 patient-years, DM was diagnosed in 8% (22 patients), mostly in pretreated patients (10 vs 4%; P=0.1). Thus, the overall rate of incident DM was 2.85 per 100 person-years, mostly in previous IR (10.39 vs 0.82/100 person-years; P=0.01).

Eighty-six subjects were included and 65 samples were amplified successfully and sequenced. HIV-1 genotyping was performed using the Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le SIDA AC11 resistance procedure. The median treatment duration was 32 months (range: 6-88) and the median viral load, 5log10copies/ml (range: 3.13-7). Fifty-nine patients (90.8%) were on first line regimens including 32.0% (19/59) on triomune fixed-dose and six on second-line therapy with NonNucleoside Reverse Transcriptase plus a protease inhibitor. Forty-seven patients (72.3%) had at least one drug resistance mutation including 73.0% (43/59) on first-line therapy. For the second-line, one out of six patients presented resistance mutations and only one presented PI DRM. Overall, the most common DRMs detected were M184V/I (n=32; 49.2%), K103N (n=28; 43%), and Y181C (n=13; 20%). Thymidine Analog Mutations (TAMs) were found in 26.0% (n=17) of strains and the most common was T215Y (n=11, 16.9%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed 17 HIV-1 variants with the predominance of CRF02_AG (n=42; 64.6%). A high rate of DRM was found in this study and shows the potential need for a structured virological surveillance including viral load quantification and genotyping.

Guidelines for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection consider lamivudine and emtricitabine to be interchangeable components in first-line combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). The evidence for their clinical equivalence in cART is inconsistent. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the virological responses to lamivudine and emtricitabine in recommended cART. Methods. This was an observational study using data from the AIDS Therapy Evaluation in the Netherlands (ATHENA) nationwide HIV cohort. The virological responses to lamivudine and emtricitabine were compared by multivariable adjusted logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models. Sensitivity analyses included propensity score adjusted models. Results. Therapy-naive HIV-1-infected patients without baseline resistance (N = 4740) initiated lamivudine or emtricitabine with efavirenz/tenofovir or nevirapine/tenofovir. The use of lamivudine was associated with more virological failure at week 48 compared to emtricitabine with efavirenz/tenofovir (10.8% vs 3.6%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-2.84) and nevirapine/tenofovir (27% vs 11%; AOR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.25-3.52) in on-treatment analysis. Propensity score-adjusted models and intent-to-treat sensitivity analyses gave comparable results. The adjusted hazard ratio of virological failure at week 240 using lamivudine instead of emtricitabine was 2.35 (95% CI, 1.61-3.42) with efavirenz and 2.01 (95% CI, 1.36-2.98) with nevirapine. The inclusion of lamivudine or emtricitabine in cART did not influence the time to virological suppression within 48 weeks or the probability of virological rebound after successful virological suppression.

This study describes the implementation of this recommendation and trends in usage of antiretroviral therapy combinations in a cohort of HIV-positive patients in rural Tanzania.Methods: We analyzed longitudinal, prospectively collected clinical data of HIV-1 infected adults initiating antiretroviral therapy within the Kilombero Ulanga Antiretroviral Cohort (KIULARCO) in Ifakara, Tanzania from 2007-2011.Results: This analysis included data of 3008 patients. Median age was 38 (interquartile range [IQR] 31-45) years, 1962 (65.2%) of all subjects were female, and median CD4+ cell count at enrollment was 168 cells/mm3 (IQR 81-273). The percentage of prescriptions containing stavudine in initial regimens fell from a maximum of 75.3% in 2008 to 10.7% in 2011. TDF/FTC/EFV became available in 2009 and was used in 41.9% of patients initiating cART in 2011. An overall on-treatment analysis revealed that d4T/3TC/NVP and AZT/3TC/EFV were the most prescribed combinations in each year, including 2011 (674 [36.5%] and 641 [34.7%] patients, respectively). Of those receiving stavudine in 2011, 659 (89.1%) initiated it before 2011.Conclusions: Initial cART with stavudine declined to low levels according to recommendations but the overall use of stavudine remained substantial, as individuals already on cART containing stavudine were not changed to alternative drugs. Our findings highlight the critical need to exchange stavudine in treatment regimens of patients who initiated therapy in earlier years. © 2014 Franzeck et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-90;4.5;4.3;4.1;;90;;

MK-1439 is a novel NNRTI with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 12, 9.7, and 9.7 nM against the wild type (WT) and K103N and Y181C reverse transcriptase (RT) mutants, respectively, in a biochemical assay. Selectivity and cytotoxicity studies confirmed that MK-1439 is a highly specific NNRTI with minimum off-target activities. In the presence of 50% normal human serum (NHS), MK-1439 showed excellent potency in suppressing the replication of WT virus, with a 95% effective concentration (EC95) of 20 nM, as well as K103N, Y181C, and K103N/Y181C mutant viruses with EC95 of 43, 27, and 55 nM, respectively. MK-1439 exhibited similar antiviral activities against 10 different HIV-1 subtype viruses (a total of 93 viruses). In addition, the susceptibility of a broader array of clinical NNRTI-associated mutant viruses (a total of 96 viruses) to MK-1439 and other benchmark NNRTIs was investigated. The results showed that the mutant profile of MK-1439 was superior overall to that of efavirenz (EFV) and comparable to that of etravirine (ETR) and rilpivirine (RPV). Furthermore, E138K, Y181C, and K101E mutant viruses that are associated with ETR and RPV were susceptible to MK-1439 with a fold change (FC) of <3. A two-drug in vitro combination study indicated that MK-1439 acts nonantagonistically in the antiviral activity with each of 18 FDA-licensed drugs for HIV infection. Taken together, these in vitro data suggest that MK-1439 possesses the desired properties for further development as a new antiviral agent. Copyright © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

Here we show in lymph node samples obtained before and during 6 mo of treatment that the tissue concentrations of five of the most frequently used antiretroviral drugs are much lower than in peripheral blood. These lower concentrations correlated with continued virus replication measured by the slower decay or increases in the follicular dendritic cell network pool of virions and with detection of viral RNA in productively infected cells. The evidence of persistent replication associated with apparently suboptimal drug concentrations argues for development and evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies that will fully suppress viral replication in lymphatic tissues. These strategies could avert the long-term clinical consequences of chronic immune activation driven directly or indirectly by low-level viral replication to thereby improve immune reconstitution.;http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1318249111;17.1;16.1;15.7;00278424;;;

Methods: A prospective cohort study with follow-up at 12 months was conducted in four urban sentinel sites in China. Antiretroviral naive patients 18 years old were recruited. Blood samples were collected for testing CD4 cell count, viral load, and (for samples with HIV-1 RNA 1000 copies/ml) genotyping of drug resistance. Results: A total of 513 patients were enrolled in this cohort, of whom 448 (87.3%) were retained at 12 months. The median final CD4 cell count was 313 cells/mm3, which increased from 192 cells/mm3 at baseline (P<0.0001). Of the 448 remaining subjects, 394 (87.9%) had successful virological suppression (HIV RNA <1000 copies/ml). Among 54 samples with viral load 1000 copies/ml, 40 were successfully genotyped, and 11 were found with detectable HIV drug resistance mutations. Of these, the proportions of drug resistance to NNRTIs, NRTIs and PIs were 100%, 81.8% and 0%, respectively. Injecting drug use (AOR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.19,0.84; P = 0.0154), CD4 count at baseline 350 cells/mm3 (AOR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.14,0.72; P = 0.0056), and missed doses in the past month (AOR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.15,0.60; P = 0.0006) were significantly negatively associated with HIV RNA <1000 copies/ml. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates effective virological and immunological outcomes at 12 months among these who initiated first-line ART treatment. However, patients infected through drug injection, who missed doses, or with higher CD4 count at baseline are at increased risk for poor virological response. © 2014 Wang et al.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0088305;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e88305;;

However, drug resistance mutations (DRMs) compromise viral control, affecting the long-term effectiveness of ART. The aims of this study were to detect and identify DRMs in a HIV-1 infected paediatric cohort. Methods: Paired plasma and dried blood spots (DBSs) specimens were obtained from HIV-1 perinatally infected patients attending the Jacobi Medical Center, New York, USA. Clinical, virological and immunological data for these patients were analysed. HIV-1 pol sequences were generated from samples to identify DRMs according to the International AIDS Society (IAS) 2011 list. Results: Forty-seven perinatally infected patients were selected, with a median age of 17.7 years, of whom 97.4% were carrying subtype B. They had a mean viral load of 3143 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL and a mean CD4 count of 486 cells/L at the time of sampling. Nineteen patients (40.4%) had achieved undetectable viraemia (<50 copies/mL) and 40.5% had a CD4 count of >500 cells/L. Most of the patients (97.9%) had received cART, including protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens in 59.6% of cases. The DRM prevalence was 54.1, 27.6 and 27.0% for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), PIs and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), respectively. Almost two-thirds (64.9%) of the patients harboured DRMs to at least one drug class and 5.4% were triple resistant. The mean nucleotide similarity between plasma and DBS sequences was 97.9%. Identical DRM profiles were present in 60% of plasma-DBS paired sequences. A total of 30 DRMs were detected in plasma and 26 in DBSs, with 23 present in both. Conclusions: Although more perinatally HIV-1-infected children are reaching adulthood as a result of advances in cART, our study cohort presented a high prevalence of resistant viruses, especially viruses resistant to NRTIs. DBS specimens can be used for DRM detection. © 2013 British HIV Association.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/hiv.12089;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;

Here we report on a patient with VL and HIV-1 co-infection who received a high dose and an extended course of sodium stibogluconate treatment in addition to antiretroviral therapy (ART). This treatment regimen resulted in good control of VL and HIV-1 infection, while the conventional protocol of sodium stibogluconate treatment was not able to prevent multiple VL relapses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first surviving case of VL and HIV-1 co-infection with this particular treatment regimen in China. © 2014 SSCC.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1038/emi.2014.24;7.3;4.9;6.9;;e24;;

A PSQ approach for detecting and quantifying mutations was developed for the analysis of 14 codons of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) gene below the limit of conventional sequencing. Ten patients who experienced virological failure (VF) after a first-line regimen of lamivudine, tenofovir, and either efavirenz, nevirapine, or etravirine, as well as 10 controls patients without VF, were included in this retrospective study. Baseline plasma and plasma from the time of VF were assessed using Sanger sequencing and PSQ methods. The analytical sensitivity for the detection of minor sequence variants is 5%. At baseline, no minority variant was detected in 10/10 patient controls using both the Sanger sequencing and PSQ assays, whereas, two patients who failed therapy had baseline non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations that were not detected by the standard genotyping. At the time of VF, standard genotyping detected mutations in four out of the 10 VF patients, whereas, PSQ detected mutations in five out of the 10 VF patients. Clinically, minority mutations at a 10% level of detection can be assessed efficiently by pyrosequencing and used as a suitable predictor of the evolution of viral populations. These traits allow for a better interpretation of data analysis, which can help clinicians in providing a suitable treatment for HIV. J. Med.

No clinical trial to date has compared plasma tenofovir concentrations, renal function, and treatment responses in HIV-infected patients who received Tenofovir GPO300 versus Viread (original tenofovir) as part of an antiretroviral regimen. We studied 129 antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naive HIV-1 infected patients who received an antiretroviral regimen of lamivudine, efavirenz and Tenofovir GPO300 (n=65) or Viread (n=64). We examined plasma tenofovir concentrations (12 hours after dosing), serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Modification in Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study formula, fractional excretion of phosphate (FEphos), CD4 and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at 12 weeks, and CD4 and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at 24 weeks after initiating the drugs. At baseline, the mean±SD subject body weight was 54±10 kilograms and the mean±SD subject age was 37±8 years. At baseline, the median (IQR) CD4 count was 44 (18-120) cells/ mm3 and the median (IQR) HIV-1 RNA level was 5.8 log copies/ml. At baseline, the mean±SD eGFR was 134.8±43.6 ml/min/1.73 m2. The baseline values for the two groups were not significantly different from each other (p>0.05). At 12 weeks, the mean±SD plasma tenofovir concentration was 106.9±41.5 ng/ml among the patients who received Tenofovir GPO300 and 100.7±49.4 ng/ml among those who received Viread (p=0.437). At week 12, there were no differences between those who rceived Tenofovir GPO300 and Vilead in mean serum creatinine (0.78 vs 0.81 mg/dl, p=0.283), mean eGFR (117.9 vs 109.1 ml/min/1.73 m2, p=0.089), decline in eGFR from baseline (-21.8 vs -20.6 ml/min/1.73 m2, p=0.860) or mean FEphos (11.4 vs 11.2, p=0.923). The median CD4 cell counts and number of patients with undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA at week 24 were not significantly different (p>0.05) between those who took Tenofovir GPO300 and Viread. In summary, plasma tenofovir concentrations, changes in renal function, urinary phosphate excretion and treatment responses were comparable between HIV-infected patients who received Tenofovir GPO300 and Viread-containing non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase regimens.;None;1.2;1.2;0.9;01251562;;;

Long-term outcomes and the effects of introducing tenofovir as part of ART in these populations have not been characterized. Methods.The study comprised a cross-sectional analysis of 106 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HBV-coinfected subjects maintained on lamivudine, as well as a prospective analysis of 76 lamivudine-experienced subjects who introduced tenofovir. Patients underwent assessment of liver fibrosis by transient elastography (TE) and testing to characterize HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HBV replication. Results.After a median of 45 months of lamivudine treatment, HIV-1 RNA and HBV DNA were detectable in 35 of 106 (33.0%) and 54 of 106 (50.9%) subjects, respectively, with corresponding drug resistance rates of 17 of 106 (16.0%) and 31 of 106 (29.2%), respectively. Median TE values were 5.7 kPa (interquartile range, 4.7-7.2 kPa) and independently associated with HBV DNA load, aspartate aminotransferase levels, and platelet counts; 13 of 106 (12.3%) subjects had TE measurements >9.4 kPa. Twelve months after the first assessment, and a median of 7.8 months after introducing tenofovir, HBV DNA levels declined by a mean of 1.5 log<inf>10</inf> IU/mL (P <. 001). TE values changed by a mean of-0.2 kPa (P =. 097), and declined significantly in subjects who had pretenofovir HBV DNA levels >2000 IU/mL (mean,-0.8 kPa; P =. 048) or TE values >7.6 kPa (mean,-1.2 kPa; P =. 021). HIV-1 RNA detection rates remained unchanged. Conclusions.A proportion of HIV/HBV-coinfected patients on long-term lamivudine-containing ART had poor HIV and HBV suppression, drug resistance, and TE values indicative of advanced liver fibrosis.

In this study, the viral subtype and appearance of drug resistance mutations in the HIV-1 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes were determined among drug-treated, HIV-1-infected patients in Surabaya. HIV-1 patients who received antiretroviral therapy (ART) more than 2 years were randomly recruited regardless of the viral load or ART failure. Fifty-eight HIV-1 PR genes and 53 RT genes were sequenced. CRF01-AE viruses were identified as the predominant strain. Major drug resistance mutations were not detected in the PR genes. In contrast, 37.7% (20/53) of the participants had one or more major drug resistance mutations in the RT genes, predominantly M184V (28.3%), K103N (11.3%), and thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs) (20.8%). The high prevalence of drug resistance mutations in RT genes indicated the necessity of monitoring the effectiveness of ART in Indonesia.;http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2014.0221;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

Aim of the study was to investigate the impact of various antiretroviral regimens on markers of immune activation and inflammation during the first two years of effective therapy.Methods: We studied HIV-infected antiretroviral-naïve patients who began cART with either abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir/emtricitabine, combined with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r), atazanavir (ATV/r) or efavirenz (EFV). All the patients had a virological response within 6 months, which was maintained for 2 years with no change in their ART regimen. C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble CD14 (sCD14), monokine induced by interferon- (MIG) and interferon--inducible protein-10 (IP-10) were measured in stored plasma obtained at cART initiation and 24 months later. Mean changes from baseline were analyzed on loge-transformed values and multivariable linear regression models were used to study the effect of the treatment components, after adjusting for factors that might have influenced the choice of ART regimen or biomarker levels. Differences were expressed as the mean fold change percentage difference ().Results: Seventy-eight patients (91% males) with a median age of 43 years met the inclusion criteria. Their median baseline CD4 cell count was 315/mm3 and HIV-1 RNA level 4.6 log10 copies/ml. During the 2-years study period, IL-6, IP-10 and MIG levels fell significantly, while hs-CRP and sCD14 levels remained stable. IP-10 and MIG levels declined significantly less strongly with ATV/r than with EFV (IP-10 -57%, p = 0.011; MIG -136%, p = 0.007), while no difference was noted between LPV/r and EFV. The decline in IL-6 did not differ significantly across the different treatment components.Conclusions: After the first 2 years of successful cART, IL-6, IP-10 and MIG fell markedly while hs-CRP and sCD14 levels remained stable. The only impact of ART regimen was a smaller fall in markers of immune activation with ATV/r than with EFV. Our results suggest that these markers could be worthwhile when evaluating new antiretroviral drugs. © 2014 Hattab et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-122;4.5;4.3;4.1;;122;;

The efficacy of first-line regimens has attained remarkably high levels, reaching undetectable viral loads in 90% of patients by Week 48; however, there remain patients who require a change in regimen due to adverse events, virologic failure with emergent resistance or other issues of patient management. Large, randomized clinical trials conducted in antiretroviral treatment-naive individuals are required for drug approval in this population in the US, EU and other countries, with the primary endpoint for virologic success at Week 48. However, there are differences in the definition of virologic failure and the evaluation of drug resistance among the trials. This review focuses on the methodology and tabulation of resistance to INSTIs in phase 3 clinical trials of first-line regimens and discusses case studies of resistance. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.";http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/6/7/2858;5.8;5.3;4.3;19994915;;;

Moreover, a case series of four HIV/HCV genotype (HCV-GT)1 patients with rapid virologic response (RVR), who received only 28 weeks of BOC-based triple-therapy (BOCW28), was reported. 290/440 HIV-positive patients with positive HCV serology had at least one visit during the past 2 years, 142/290 had target detectable HCV-RNA with 64% (82/142) carrying HCV-GT1. While 18 HIV/HCV-GT1 displayed contraindications, 45% (64/142) of HIV/HCV were eligible for triple-therapy. Insufficiently controlled HIV-infection despite combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) (HIV-RNA <50 copies/mL: 73% vs. 22%; p<0.001) and liver cirrhosis (31% vs. 8%; p=0.025) were overrepresented among patients with contraindications for triple-therapy. Low treatment uptake rates (39% (25/64)) during the first 2 years of triple-therapy availability suggest that its benefit in HIV/HCV co-infected patients might fall short of expectations. Modification of cART or TPV dose adjustment would have been necessary in 61% and 84% of HIV/HCV-GT1 on cART eligible for triple-therapy using TPV and BOC, respectively, suggesting that drug-drug interactions with cART complicate management in the majority of patients.

Prior to the start of therapy, genotyping of HIV-1 for mutations that confer resistance to potential drug candidates is crucial for it allows formulating an effective regimen. Ineffective drugs are excluded and potentially effective ones are included. A number of diagnostic kits are commercially available for this purpose but are tailored for HIV-1 subtype-B, a strain chiefly found in AIDS patients of Europe and America. However, AIDS patients of South-East Asia including Thailand are predominant infected with HIV-1 subtype non-B. In this study, an inexpensive assay was developed that genotypes HIV-1 non-B for drug resistance and tested it on 99 Thai AIDS patients. Results showed that 98 were infected with HIV-1 subtype non-B (or CRF01_AE) and one with subtype-B. Within the HIV-1 polymerase (pol), reverse transcriptase (RT) gene, the assay identified 18 codon mutations associated with resistance to Nucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) and 17 Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs). Employing a commercially available kit, parallel genotyping of patient samples confirmed results providing validation of the assay. This method approximately costs 100 US dollars compared to $300 for a commercially available test. In Thailand, the burden of cost for treating HIV-infections is high not only for the average citizen but the country's health care systems. Therefore the low cost and yet effective genotyping test for HIV-1 subtype non-B is a practical and viable solution to expensive genotyping platforms. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166093414000172;3.5;3.3;3.4;01660934;;;

Methods: We analysed 2781 sequences from ARV naive patients of the CoRIS cohort (Spain) between 2007-2011. Using the Stanford algorithm ""Low-level resistance"", ""Intermediate resistance"" and ""High-level resistance"" categories were considered as ""Resistant"". Results: 70% of the TDR found using the WHO list were relevant for first-line treatment according to the Stanford algorithm. A total of 188 patients showed clinically relevant resistance to first-line ARVs [6.8% (95%Confidence Interval: 5.8-7.7)], and 221 harbored TDR using the WHO list [7.9% (6.9-9.0)]. Differences were due to a lower prevalence in clinically relevant resistance for NRTIs [2.3% (1.8-2.9) vs. 3.6% (2.9-4.3) by the WHO list] and PIs [0.8% (0.4-1.1) vs. 1.7% (1.2-2.2)], while it was higher for NNRTIs [4.6% (3.8-5.3) vs. 3.7% (3.0-4.7)]. While TDR remained stable throughout the study period, clinically relevant resistance to first line drugs showed a significant trend to a decline (p = 0.02). Conclusions: Prevalence of clinically relevant resistance to first line ARVs in Spain is decreasing, and lower than the one expected looking at TDR using the WHO list. Resistance to first-line PIs falls below 1%, so the recommendation of screening for TDR in the protease gene should be questioned in our setting. Cost-effectiveness studies need to be carried out to inform evidence-based recommendations. Copyright: © 2014 Monge et al.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090710;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e90710;;

Furthermore with increasing mobility of people HIV-1 subtypes other than the predominant subtype C may likely be introduced from the neighbouring countries. This study was aimed to determine the molecular characterization and pre-antiretroviral treatment resistance mutations among HIV-1 chronically infected ART naïve patients after the roll out of ART in Ethiopia.Methods:Viral RNA was determined in 160 baseline plasma samples. The entire PR and the first 335 codons (76%) of the RT regions of the pol gene of the HIV-1 genome (N = 160) were amplified and sequenced using an in-house assay. Genotypic drug resistance was defined as the presence of one or more resistance-related mutations as specified by the consensus mutation of Stanford University HIVDB and the International Antiviral Society (IAS) mutation lists.Results:A predominance of HIV-1 subtype C (98.7%) was observed. The level of drug resistance is found to be 5.6% and 13.1% according to the Stanford University HIVDB drug resistance interpretation algorithms and the International Antiviral Society mutation lists, respectively. Mutations conferring simultaneous resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs were not detected and no major PR mutation was found. However, a high rate of polymorphic changes both in PR and RT regions were observed. Moreover, twenty four (15%) monophyletic transmission clusters with bootstrap value of 99% were found.Conclusions:Strong evidence for consistent HIV-1C clade homogeneity and low influx of other variant into the country was found. The level of drug resistance observed in chronically infected treatment naïve patients which exceeds the WHO estimates suggests the need for incorporation of HIV-1 drug resistance testing prior to ART initiation. The occurrence of monophyletic transmission clusters affecting (24/160) individuals indicates their potential risk related practice. Thus, an intensified public health intervention program and monitoring of HIV drug resistance testing appears indispensible. © 2014 Mulu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-158;4.5;4.3;4.1;;158;;

In 2008, the next-generation NNRTI etravirine was approved for the treatment of HIV-infected antiretroviral therapy-experienced individuals, including those with prior NNRTI exposure. NNRTIs are also increasingly being included in strategies to prevent HIV-1 infection. For example: (1) nevirapine is used to prevent mother-to-child transmission; (2) the ASPIRE (MTN 020) study will test whether a vaginal ring containing dapivirine can prevent HIV-1 infection in women; (3) a microbicide gel formulation containing the urea-PETT derivative MIV-150 is in a phase I study to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and acceptability; and (4) a long acting rilpivirine formulation is under-development for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Given their widespread use, particularly in resource-limited settings, as well as their low genetic barriers to resistance, there are concerns about overlapping resistance between the different NNRTIs. Consequently, a better understanding of the resistance and cross-resistance profiles among the NNRTI class is important for predicting response to treatment, and surveillance of transmitted drug-resistance. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.";http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/6/8/2960;5.8;5.3;4.3;19994915;;;

Pooled ECHO/THRIVE lipid and body fat data are presented from the ECHO (Efficacy Comparison in Treatment-Naïve, HIV-Infected Subjects of TMC278 and Efavirenz) and THRIVE (TMC278 Against HIV, in a Once-Daily Regimen Versus Efavirenz) trials. Methods. We assessed the 96-week effects on lipids, adverse events (AEs), and body fat distribution (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) of rilpivirine (RPV) and EFV plus 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs) in treatment-naive adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Results. Rilpivirine produced minimal changes in total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides. Compared with RPV, EFV significantly (P < .001) increased lipid levels. Decreases in the TC/HDL-C ratio were similar with RPV and EFV. Background N[t] RTI affected RPV-induced lipid changes; all levels increased with zidovudine/lamivudine (3TC) and abacavir/3TC (except triglycerides, which were unchanged). With emtricitabine/tenofovir, levels of HDL-C were increased, TC and LDL-C were unchanged, and triglycerides were decreased. With EFV, lipid levels increased in each N[t]RTI subgroup (except triglycerides were unchanged with abacavir/3TC). Fewer (P < .001) RPV-treated patients than EFV-treated patients had TC, LDL-C, and triglyceride levels above National Cholesterol Education Program cutoffs. More RPV-than EFV-treated patients had HDL-C values below these cutoffs (P = .02). Dyslipidemia AEs were less common with RPV than with EFV. Similar proportions of patients had a 10% decrease in limb fat (16% with RPV and 17% with EFV). Limb fat was significantly (P < .001) increased to a similar extent (by 12% with RPV and 11% with EFV). At week 96, patients receiving zidovudine/3TC had lost limb fat, and those receiving emtricitabine/tenofovir had gained it. Conclusions. Over the course of 96 weeks, RPV-based therapy was associated with lower increases in lipid parameters and fewer dyslipidemia AEs than EFV-based treatment. Body fat distribution changes were similar between treatments. The N[t]RTI regimen affected lipid and body fat distribution changes. © The Author 2014.";https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/59/3/425/2895310;14.0;13.8;12.5;10584838;;;

Methods: This retrospective study, conducted in 2010-2012 in the HIV clinic of Calmette Hospital located in Phnom Penh (Cambodia) assessed virological failure (VF) rates and patterns of drug resistance of naive and pre-treated patients. Naive and ART pre-treated patients were included when a Viral Load (VL) was performed during the first year of ART for naive subjects or at the first consultation for pre-treated individuals. Patients showing Virological failure (VF) (>1,000 copies/ml) underwent HIV DR genotyping testing. Interpretation of drug resistance mutations was done according to 2013 version 23 ANRS algorithms. Results: On a total of 209 patients, 164 (78.4%) were naive and 45 (21.5%) were ART pre-treated. Their median initial CD4 counts were 74 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (IQR: 30-194) and 279 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (IQR: 103-455) (p,<0.001), respectively. Twenty seven patients (12.9%) exhibited VF (95% CI: 8.6-18.2%), including 10 naive (10/164, 6.0%) and 17 pre-treated (17/45, 37.8%) patients (p< 0.001). Among these viremic patients, twenty-two (81.4%) were sequenced in reverse transcriptase and protease coding regions. Overall, 19 (86.3%) harbored 1 drug resistance mutations (DRMs) whereas 3 (all belonging to pre-treated patients) harbored wild-types viruses. The most frequent DRMs were M184V (86.3%), K103N (45.5%) and thymidine analog mutations (TAMs) (40.9%). Two (13.3%) pre-treated patients harbored viruses that showed a multi-nucleos(t)ide resistance including Q151M, K65R, E33A/D, E44A/D mutations. Conclusion: In Cambodia, VF rates were low for naive patients but the emergence of DRMs to NNRTI and 3TC occurred relatively quickly in this subgroup. In pre-treated patients, VF rates were much higher and TAMs were relatively common. HIV genotypic assays before ART initiation and for ART pre-treated patients infection should be considered as well. © 2014 Barennes et al.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0105736;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e105736;;

We estimated the relative efficacy and safety of dolutegravir (DTG) versus third agents currently recommended by guidelines, including ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r), ritonavir-boosted darunavir (DRV/r), efavirenz (EFV), cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir (EVG/c), ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r), raltegravir (RAL), and rilpivirine (RPV), in treatment-naive HIV-1-infected patients. Methods: A systematic review of published literature was conducted to identify phase 3/4 randomized controlled clinical trials (up to August 2013) including at least one third agent of interest in combination with a backbone nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) regimen. Bayesian fixed-effect network meta-analysis models adjusting for the type of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine [TDF/FTC] or abacavir/lamivudine [ABC/3TC]) were used to evaluate week 48 efficacy (HIV-RNA suppression to 50 copies/mL and change in CD4+ cells/L) and safety (lipid changes, adverse events, and discontinuations due to adverse events) of DTG relative to all other treatments. Sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of NRTI treatment adjustment and random-effects models were performed. Results: Thirty-one studies including 17,000 patients were combined in the analysis. Adjusting for the effect of NRTI backbone, treatment with DTG resulted in significantly higher odds of virologic suppression (HIV RNA 50 copies/mL) and increase in CD4+ cells/L versus ATV/r, DRV/r, EFV, LPV/r, and RPV. Dolutegravir had better or equivalent changes in total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides, and lower odds of adverse events and discontinuation due to adverse events compared to all treatments. Random-effects and unadjusted models resulted in similar conclusions. Conclusion: Three clinical trials of DTG have demonstrated comparable or superior efficacy and safety to DRV, RAL, and EFV in HIV-1-infected treatment-naive patients. This network meta-analysis suggests DTG is also favorable or comparable to other commonly used third agents (ATV/r, LPV/r, RPV, and EVG/c).;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0105653;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e105653;;

Methods: We examined changes in urine protein:creatinine (UPCR) and urine albumin:creatinine (UACR) ratios in 245 ART-naive participants in A5202 randomized in a substudy to blinded NRTI (abacavir/lamivudine, ABC/3TC, n = 124 or TDF/emtricitabine, TDF/FTC, n = 121) with open-label protease inhibitor (PI) atazanavir/ritonavir or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) efavirenz. Results: At baseline, 18% of participants had clinically significant proteinuria (UPCR 200 mg/g), and 11% had clinically significant albuminuria (UACR 30 mg/g). The prevalence of clinically significant proteinuria and albuminuria decreased from baseline to week 96 in all treatment groups. In intention-to-treat analyses, there was a significant effect of NRTI component on fold change in UPCR (P = 0.011) and UACR (P = 0.018) from baseline to week 96, with greater improvements in participants randomized to ABC/3TC. There was no significant effect of NNRTI/PI component on fold change in UPCR (P = 0.23) or UACR (P = 0.88), and no significant interactions between NRTI and NNRTI/PI components. Conclusions: In this prespecified secondary analysis, ART initiation was associated with improvements in proteinuria and albuminuria, with significantly greater improvements in participants randomized to ABC/3TC versus TDF/FTC. These are the first data from a randomized trial to suggest that initiation of TDF/FTC may not be associated with the same degree of improvement in proteinuria and albuminuria that have been reported with other regimens. Future studies should consider the long-term clinical significance of these findings. © 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.";http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201409010-00007;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

K70R is part of the thymidine analog mutations, but also other amino acid changes have been associated with NRTI resistance, such as K70E and K70G. In this study, we investigated the in vivo selection of the HIV-1 RT mutations K70S and K70T and their in vitro effect on drug resistance and replication capacity. Methods: Recombinant viruses with RT mutations were generated to measure the in vitro drug susceptibility and replication capacity. Bayesian network analysis and three-dimensional modeling were performed to understand the selection and impact of the RT70 mutations. Results: K70S and K70T were found at a low frequency in RTI-experienced HIV-1 patients (0.10% and 0.20%). Baeyesian network learning identified no direct association with the in vivo exposure to any specific RTI. However, direct associations of K70S with mutations within the Q151M-complex and of K70T with K65R were observed. In vitro phenotypic testing revealed only minor effects of K70R/S/T as single mutations, associated with Q151M and within the context of the Q151M-complex. Discussion: These results suggest that the selection of K70S/T and their phenotypic impact are influenced by the presence of other mutations in RT. However, the low impact on in vitro phenotype here observed, alongside with the low in vivo prevalence, the exclusive direct association with known major RTI mutations and the unknown correlation with in vivo response, do not yet necessitate the inclusion of K70S/T in drug resistance interpretation systems.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/2295333714Y.0000000038;1.3;1.3;1.8;17843286;;;

All rights reserved.The availability of generic lamivudine in the context of the current economic crisis has raised a new issue in some European countries: breaking up the once-daily fixed-dose antiretroviral combinations (FDAC) of efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabine, tenofovir/emtricitabine, or abacavir/lamivudine, in order to administer their components separately, thereby allowing the use of generic lamivudine instead of branded emtricitabine or lamivudine. The legal, ethical, and economic implications of this potential strategy are reviewed, particularly in those patients receiving a once-daily single-tablet regimen. An unfamiliar change in antiretroviral treatment from a successful patient-friendly FDAC into a more complex regimen including separately the components to allow the substitution of one (or some) of them for generic surrogates (in the absence of a generic bioequivalent FDAC) could be discriminatory because it does not guarantee access to equal excellence in healthcare to all citizens. Furthermore, it could violate the principle of non-maleficence by potentially causing harm both at the individual level (hindering adherence and favouring treatment failure and resistance), and at the community level (hampering control of disease transmission and transmission of HIV-1 resistance). Replacing a FDAC with the individual components of that combination should only be permitted when the substituting medication has the same qualitative and quantitative composition of active ingredients, pharmaceutical form, method of administration, dosage and presentation as the medication being replaced, and a randomized study has demonstrated its non-inferiority. Finally, a strict pharma-economic study supporting this change, comparing the effectiveness and the cost of a specific intervention with the best available alternative, should be undertaken before its potential implementation.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0213005X13002413;1.8;1.7;1.7;0213005X;;;

To date, only a few HIV-1 vaccine candidates have been tested in infants. Trial design: A phase I/II randomized controlled trial PedVacc 002 was conducted to determine the safety and immunogenicity of a single, low dose of MVA.HIVA vaccine delivered intramuscularly to healthy 20-week-old infants born to HIV-1-positive mothers in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods: Pregnant HIV-1-positive women in the 2nd/3rd trimester of gestation were enrolled, provided with ART and self-selected their infant-feeding modality. Infants received nevirapine and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis. At 20 weeks of age, eligible HIV-1-negative infants were randomized to vaccine versus no-treatment arms and followed to 48 weeks of age for assessments of vaccine safety, HIV-1-specific T-cell responses and antibodies to routine childhood vaccines. Results: Between February and November 2010, 182 mothers were screened, 104 were eligible and followed on ART during pregnancy/postpartum, of whom 73 had eligible infants at 20 weeks postpartum. Thirty-six infants were randomized to vaccine and 37 to no treatment. Eighty-four percent of infants breastfed, and retention at 48 weeks was 99%. Adverse events were rare and similar between the two arms. HIV-1-specific T-cell frequencies in interferon- ELISPOT assay were transiently higher in the MVA.HIVA arm (. p=. 0.002), but not above the threshold for a positive assay. Protective antibody levels were adequate and similar between arms for all routine childhood vaccines except HBV, where 71% of MVA.HIVA subjects compared to 92% of control subjects were protected (. p=. 0.05). Conclusions: This trial tested for the first time an MVA-vectored candidate HIV-1 vaccine in HIV-1-exposed infants in Africa, demonstrating trial feasibility and vaccine safety, low immunogenicity, and compatibility with routine childhood vaccinations. These results are reassuring for use of the MVA vector in more potent prime-boost regimens.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264410X14011578;6.0;5.7;5.5;0264410X;;;

The accumulation of biologically active episomal HIV-1 cDNAs, following aborted integration, could contribute to antiviral potency in vivo. Methods: This prospective, controlled clinical observation study explored raltegravir's impact on the dynamics of HIV-1 RNA in plasma, and concentrations of total HIV-1 cDNA, episomal 2-long terminal repeat (LTR) circles and HIV-1 integrants in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Individuals starting therapy with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus either raltegravir (raltegravir group; n=10 patients) or boosted protease inhibitor/non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (control group; n=10 patients) were followed for 48 weeks. Results: Suppression of HIV-1 RNA (<50 copies/mL) was reached earlier (5/10 versus 0/10 at week 4; 8/10 versus 4/10 at week 12) on raltegravir. Significant total HIV-1 cDNA reductions in PBMC were reached by day 99 and persisted until day 330, with median factors of decrease of 7.2 and 8.9, respectively. Broad inter-individual variations, yet no treatment-associated differences, were noted for HIV-1 cDNA concentrations. Despite reductions in HIV-1 RNA (~3 log) and total HIV-1 cDNA (~1 log), concentrations of integrants and 2-LTR circles remained largely unchanged. Conclusions: These results extend the previously reported early benefit of raltegravir on the decline of plasma viraemia to treatment-naive patients. The modest treatment-associated, yet group-independent, decline in total HIV-1 cDNA load and the lack of significant changes in integrated and episomal HIV-1 cDNA suggest that most integrated DNA is archival and targeting of HIV reservoirs other than PBMC may underlie beneficial effects of raltegravir.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dku213;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

Thus, once-daily dosing can lead to improved patient adherence to medication and, consequently, sustained virological suppression and reduction in the risk of emergence of drug resistance. Several trials have evaluated once-daily darunavir/ritonavir in combination with other antiretrovirals (ARTEMIS and ODIN trials) or as monotherapy (MONET, MONOI and PROTEA trials) in HIV-1-infected adults. Data from ARTEMIS and ODIN demonstrate non-inferiority of once-daily darunavir/ritonavir against a comparator and, together with pharmacokinetic data, have established the suitability of once-daily darunavir/ritonavir for treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients with no darunavir resistance-associated mutations. The findings of ARTEMIS and ODIN have led to recent updates to treatment guidelines, whereby once-daily darunavir/ritonavir, given with other antiretrovirals, is now a preferred treatment option for antiretroviral-naive adult patients and a simplified treatment option for antiretroviral-experienced adults who have no darunavir resistance-associated mutations. Once-daily dosing with darunavir/ritonavir is an option for treatment-naive and for treatment-experienced paediatric patients with no darunavir resistance-associated mutations based on the findings of the DIONE trial and ARIEL substudy. This article reviews the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety and tolerability of once-daily boosted darunavir. The feasibility of darunavir/ritonavir monotherapy as a treatment approach for some patients is also discussed. Finally, data on a fixed-dose combination of 800/150 mg of darunavir/cobicistat once daily are presented, showing comparable darunavir bioavailability to that obtained with 800/100 mg of darunavir/ritonavir once daily.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dku193;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

This work was designed to determine the effects of a novel mutation, D404N, in the connection subdomain of RT of HIV-1 CRF08_BC subtype on drug resistance, viral replication capacity (RC) and RT activity. Methods: Mutation D404N, alone or together with the other reported mutations, was introduced into an HIV-1 CRF08_BC subtype infectious clone by site-directed mutagenesis. Viral susceptibility to nine RT inhibitors, viral RC and the DNA polymerase activity of viral RTof the constructed virus mutantswere investigated. A modelling study using the server SWISS-MODEL was conducted to explore the possible structure-related drug resistance mechanism of the mutation D404N. Results: Single mutations D404N and H221Yconferred low-level resistance to nevirapine, efavirenz, rilpivirine and zidovudine. Double mutations Y181C/D404N and Y181C/H221Ysignificantly reduced susceptibility to NNRTIs. The most pronounced resistance to NNRTIs was observed with the triple mutation Y181C/D404N/H221Y. Virus containing D404N as the only mutation displayed ~50% RC compared with the WT virus. The modelling study suggested that the D404N mutation might abolish the hydrogen bonds between residues 404 and K30 in p51 or K431 in p66, leading to impaired RT subunit structure and enhanced drug resistance. Conclusions: These results indicate that D404N is a novel NNRTI-associated mutation in the HIV-1 subtype CRF08_BC and provides information valuable for the monitoring of clinical RTI resistance.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dku565;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

Methods: This was an open-label, three-period, longitudinal pharmacokinetic study with patients serving as their own controls. Fifteen consenting and virologically suppressed HIV-1-infected adults were switched from an efavirenz-based regimen to TDF/FTC/RPV for 56 days. Enrolled patients underwent 24 h blood sampling with TDF/FTC/RPV dosing in the fasted state (day 42), with a low-fat meal (11 g of fat/353 kcal, day 49) and with a moderate-fat meal (19 g of fat/589 kcal, day 56; reference). A viral load assessment was performed on day 56. Results: Rilpivirine AUC0-24 was significantly decreased by 16% (geometric mean ratio, 90% CI: 0.84, 0.73-0.96) during administration in the fasted state when compared with AUC0-24 during administration with a moderatefat meal. Similarly, rilpivirine C24 was significantly decreased by 21% (0.79, 0.65-0.97) in the fasted state compared with a moderate-fat meal. Pharmacokinetic parameters were unchanged during administration with a low-fat meal, except for C24, which was significantly increased by 15% (1.15, 1.01-1.31) when compared with the moderate-fat meal. Rilpivirine Cmax was similar under the three meal conditions. Virological suppression was unchanged at the end of the study. Conclusions: A food effectwas observed for steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of rilpivirine (AUC0-24 and C24) when TDF/FTC/RPVwas administered in the fasted state compared with the moderate-fat meal.

Patients and methods: Patients receiving ART for >1 year with clinical and/or immunological failure were included. Sequencing of protease and reverse transcriptase regions was performed using Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le SIDA et les hépatites virales (ANRS) procedures and sequences were interpreted using the ANRS resistance algorithm. Results: Ninety patients were enrolled. They had been receiving ART for a median time of 42 months and half were receiving zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine. Seventy-five per cent of patients were infected with CRF02_AG. Twenty-seven per cent of patients displayed a plasma viral load <50 copies/mL. Among the 66 patients with detectable viraemia, the median viral load was 4.7 log10 copies/mL (IQR=3.0-5.6). The prevalence of NRTI and NNRTI resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) was 63% and 71%, respectively; and the median number of NRTI and NNRTI RAMs was 2 and 3, respectively. Two patients (4%) displayed viruses with PI RAMs. Regarding NRTI drug resistance, 29%, 38%, 63%, 29% and 25% of patients had viruses resistant to zidovudine, stavudine, lamivudine/emtricitabine, abacavir and tenofovir, respectively. Regarding the NNRTI drug class, 56%, 65%, 33% and 42% of patients had viruses resistant to efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine and rilpivirine, respectively. Conclusions: The high prevalence of acquired drug resistance in patients followed in two centres of the Liberian capital city, documented after a median of 3 years on a first-line ARTregimen, jeopardizes the activity of secondline regimens and highlights the need for virological monitoring in these settings.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dkv030;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

Routine monitoring of drug resistance mutations in resource limited settings like India is not possible due to high cost of commercial drug resistance assays. In this study we developed an in-house, cost effective HIV-1 drug resistance genotyping assay for Indian patients and validated it against the US-FDA-approved ViroSeq HIV-1 drug resistance testing system. A reference panel of 20 clinical samples was used to develop and validate the assay against ViroSeq HIV-1 drug resistance testing system which was subsequently used to genotype a clinical panel of 225 samples. The Stanford HIV database was used to identify drug resistant mutations. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was 1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml of plasma sample while precision and reproducibility was 99.68±0.16% and 99.76±0.18% respectively. One hundred and one drug resistant mutations were detected by the in-house assay compared to 104 by ViroSeq system in the reference panel. The assay had 91.55% success rate in genotyping the clinical panel samples and was able to detect drug resistant mutations related to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) as well as protease inhibitor (PI) classes of antiretroviral drugs. It was found to be around 71.9% more cost effective compared to ViroSeq genotyping system. This evaluation of the assay on the clinical panel demonstrates its potential for monitoring clinical HIV-1 drug resistance mutations and population-based surveillance in resource limited settings like India. © 2014 Acharya et al.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0105790;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e105790;;

This increased susceptibility may be caused by impairment of alveolar macrophage (AM) function and/or mycobacteria-specific alveolar CD4+ T-cell responses observed in HIV-infected ART-naive adults. Objectives: To determine whether ART was associated with improvement in both AM function, assessed by phagosomal proteolysis, and alveolar CD4+ T-cell responses to Mycobacterium in HIV-infected individuals. Methods: Peripheral blood was drawn and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) performed on healthy, 35 HIV-uninfected, 25 HIV-infected ART-naive, and 50 HIV-infected ART-treated asymptomatic adults. Phagosomal proteolysis of AM was assessed with fluorogenic beads. Mycobacteria-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were measured by intracellular cytokine staining. Measurements and Main Results: HIV-infected adults on ART exhibited lower plasma HIV viral load and higher blood CD4+ T-cell count than ART-naive adults. AM proteolysis and total mycobacteria-specific Th1 CD4+ T-cell responses in individuals on ART for greater than or equal to 4 years were similar to HIVuninfected control subjects but those on ART for less than 4 years had impaired responses. Total influenza-specific alveolar Th1 CD4+ T-cell responses were intact in all individuals receiving ART. In contrast, BAL and blood mycobacteria-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T-cell responses were impaired in adults on ART irrespective of duration. Conclusions: AM and mycobacteria-specific alveolar CD4+ T-cell responses in HIV-infected adults on ART for less than 4 years are impaired and may partly explain the high risk of TB in HIV-infected individuals on ART. Strategies to augment ART to improve lung immune cell function and reduce the high incidence of TB in HIVinfected adults who initiate ART should be investigated.;http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1164/rccm.201405-0864OC;18.9;20.3;21.6;1073449X;;;

This study aimed to analyse the presence or occurrence of drug resistance mutations in HIV-1-infected patients during long-term persistent low-level viraemia (PLLV) under ART. Methods: A retrospective study was carried out in which baseline and on-therapy presence of drug resistance mutations in the HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase genes were analysed in patients with PLLV between 20 and 250 copies/ml. For all available plasma samples collected during PLLV, resistance analysis was attempted with an ultrasensitive amplification and sequencing protocol. Results: Resistance analysis was successful for 154 samples collected longitudinally from 23 patients over a median period of 4.7 years (IQR 3.3-5.7). Twenty of these patients were on a boosted protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen (87%). Single drug resistance mutations were detected in isolated samples of 4 patients, 2 of the 3 patients who initiated a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimen and 2 of the 20 on a PI-based regimen. Only one of the detected mutations decreased susceptibility to the therapy regimen taken at the time of sample collection. Drug resistance mutations were not found in the three patients who developed virological failure (viral load >250 copies/ml) during the study. Conclusions: Long episodes of PLLV in patients on boosted PI-based regimens rarely result in the selection of new drug-resistant variants.;http://www.intmedpress.com/journals/avt/abstract.cfm?id=2966&pid=48;4.4;4.1;3.9;13596535;;;

We assessed the effect of following the ""when-to-start"" and ""what-to-start"" guidelines, on treatment modifications, and on immunological and virological outcome at 12 months in a cohort of HIV-1 infected patients initiating cART from 2000 to 2010. Methods: Consecutive HIV-1 infected patients, antiretroviral naive, initiating cART from 2000 to 2010 at a University Hospital were enrolled. HIV-2 infection, cART for prevention of mother-to-child transmission or during primary HIV-infection and unlicensed drugs were excluded. The respect or not of the ""when-to-start"" and ""what-to-start"" guidelines was based on French guidelines published from 2000 to 2010. Factors associated with cART modifications at 12 months and factors associated with an HIV viral load of < 50 copies/mL at 12 months were assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression modeling. Variations in CD4 counts from baseline were assessed by univariate and multivariate linear regression. Results: Of 1365 patients starting cART, 151 were treated outside ""when-to-start"" guidelines and 150 were treated outside ""what-to-start"" guidelines. Not using ""when-to-start"" guidelines was mainly related to early initiation in young men having sex with men, and was not associated with a significantly different outcome at 12 months. Treatments that did not follow ""what-to-start"" guidelines were not observed in any specific population and were associated with more treatment modifications and a poorer virological outcome at 12 months.

Cases were HIV-1 infected adults with either clinical failure (incident World Health Organization (WHO) stage 3, 4 or death by 96 weeks) or virologic failure by 24 months. Risk factors for serum selenium deficiency (<85 g/L) pre-ART and its association with outcomes were examined. Median serum selenium concentration was 82.04 g/L (Interquartile range (IQR): 57.28-99.89) and serum selenium deficiency was 53%, varying widely by country from 0% to 100%. In multivariable models, risk factors for serum selenium deficiency were country, previous tuberculosis, anemia, and elevated C-reactive protein. Serum selenium deficiency was not associated with either clinical failure or virologic failure in multivariable models. However, relative to people in the third quartile (74.86-95.10 g/L) of serum selenium, we observed increased hazards (adjusted hazards ratio (HR): 3.50; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.30-9.42) of clinical failure but not virologic failure for people in the highest quartile.

All rights reserved.Background: The combination of tenofovir and efavirenz with either lamivudine or emtricitabine (TELE) has proved to be highly effective in clinical trials for first-line treatment of HIV-1 infection. However, limited data are available on its efficacy in routine clinical practice. Methods: A multicentre cohort study was performed in therapy-naive patients initiating ART with TELE before July 2009. Efficacy was studied using ITT (missing or switch=failure) and on-treatment (OT) analyses. Genotypic susceptibility scores (GSSs) were determined using the Stanford HIVdb algorithm. Results: Efficacy analysis of 1608 patients showed virological suppression to <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks in 91.5% (OT) and 70.6%(ITT). Almost a quarter of all patients (22.9%) had discontinued TELE atweek 48,mainly due to CNS toxicity. Virological failure within 48 weeks was rarely observed (3.3%, n=53). In multilevel, multivariate analysis, infection with subtype B (P=0.011), baseline CD4 count<200 cells/mm3 (P<0.001), GSS<3 (P=0.002) and use of lamivudine (P<0.001) were associated with a higher risk of virological failure. After exclusion of patients using co-formulated compounds, virological failure was still more often observed with lamivudine. Following virological failure, three-quarters of patients switched to a PI-based regimenwith GSS <3. After 1 year of second-line therapy, viral load was suppressed to <50 copies/mL in 73.5% (OT). Conclusions: In clinical practice, treatment failure on TELE regimens is relatively frequent due to toxicity. Virological failure is rare and more often observed with lamivudine than with emtricitabine. Following virological failure on TELE, PI-based second-line therapy was often successful despite GSS <3.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dkv033;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

PEP was first used after occupational HIV exposures in the late 1980s, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issuing the first set of guidelines that included considerations regarding the use of antiretroviral agents for PEP after occupational HIV exposures in 1990. Use of PEP has been extended to nonoccupational exposures, including after sexual contact or injection-drug use.

Published by Taylor & Francis.Background: Missing data can compromise inferences from clinical trials, yet the topic has received little attention in the clinical trial community. Shortcomings in commonly used methods used to analyze studies with missing data (complete case, last- or baseline-observation carried forward) have been highlighted in a recent Food and Drug Administration-sponsored report. This report recommends how to mitigate the issues associated with missing data. We present an example of the proposed concepts using data from recent clinical trials. Methods: CD4z cell count data from the previously reported SINGLE and MOTIVATE studies of dolutegravir and maraviroc were analyzed using a variety of statistical methods to explore the impact of missing data. Four methodologies were used: complete case analysis, simple imputation, mixed models for repeated measures, and multiple imputation. We compared the sensitivity of conclusions to the volume of missing data and to the assumptions underpinning each method. Results: Rates of missing data were greater in the MOTIVATE studies (35%-68% premature withdrawal) than in SINGLE (12%-20%). The sensitivity of results to assumptions about missing data was related to volume of missing data. Estimates of treatment differences by various analysis methods ranged across a 61 cells/mm3window in MOTIVATE and a 22 cells/mm3window in SINGLE. Conclusions: Where missing data are anticipated, analyses require robust statistical and clinical debate of the necessary but unverifiable underlying statistical assumptions. Multiple imputation makes these assumptions transparent, can accommodate a broad range of scenarios, and is a natural analysis for clinical trials in HIV with missing data.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/1945577115Y.0000000003;2.8;2.7;0;15284336;;;

We aimed to describe the incidence and predictors of EFV-related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in a cohort of adult Nigerian HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods This retrospective cohort study utilized clinical data of HIV-1 infected adults (aged 15 years), commenced on efavirenz containing-regimen between January 2004 and December 2011. The time-dependent occurrence of clinical adverse events as defined by the World Health Organization was analyzed by Cox regression analysis. Results A total of 2920 patients with baseline median (IQR) age of 39 (33-46) years, largely made up of men (78%) were included in the study. During 8834 person-years of follow up, 358 adverse drug events were reported; the incidence rate was 40.3 ADRs per 1000 person-years of treatment. Lipodystrophy and neuropsychiatric disorders were the most common ADRs with incidences of 63 and 30 per 1000 patients respectively. About one-third of the neuropsychiatric adverse events were within 12 months of commencement of ART. The risk of neuropsychiatric ADRs was independently predicted for women [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 9.05; 95% CI: 5.18-15.82], those aged <40 years (aHR 2.59; 95% CI: 1.50-4.45), advanced HIV disease (WHO stage 3 or 4) [aHR 2.26; 95% CI: 1.37-3.72], and zidovudine [aHR 2.21; 95% CI: 1.27-3.83] or stavudine [aHR 4.22; 95% CI: 1.99-8.92] containing regimen compared to tenofovir. Conclusion Neuropsychiatric adverse drug events associated with efavirenz-based ART had both early and late onset in our clinical cohort of patients on chronic EFV therapy. Continuous neuropsychiatric assessment for improved detection and management of neuropsychiatric ADRs is recommended in resource-limited settings where the use of efavirenz-based regimens has been scaled up.";http://www.germs.ro/en/Articles/Incidence-and-predictors-of-adverse-drug-events-in-an-African-cohort-of-HIV-infected-adults-treated-with-efavirenz-395;1.2;1.8;2.0;;;;

However, association of adiponectin and adiposity in HIV mono- and co-infected and hepatitis (HCV) injection drug users (IDUs) has not been elucidated. Therefore, the relationship of total adiponectin levels with anthropometric indices of adiposity was examined in HIV monoinfected (anti-retroviral treatment, ART-naive, n=16 and -experienced, n=34); HCV monoinfected, n=36; HIV and HCV co-infected (ART-naive, n=5 and -experienced, n=13); uninfected, n=19 IDUs; and healthy controls, n=16 from coastal Kenya. Anthropometric indices of adiposity were recorded and total circulating adiponectin levels were measured in serum samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Adiponectin levels differed significantly amongst the study groups (P<0.0001). Post-hoc analyses revealed decreased levels in HIV mono-infected ART-naive IDUs in comparison to uninfected IDUs (P<0.05) and healthy controls (P<0.05). However, adiponectin levels were elevated in HCV mono-infected IDUs relative to HIV mono-infected ART-naive (P<0.001) and -experienced (P<0.001) as well as HIV and HCV co-infected ART-naive (P<0.05) IDUs. Furthermore, adiponectin correlated with weight (r=0.687; P=0.003) and BMI (r=0.598; P=0.014) in HIV mono-infected ART-naive IDUs; waist circumference (r= -0.626; P<0.0001), hip (r=-0.561; P=0.001) circumference, and bust-to-waist ratio (r=0.561; P=0.001) in HIV mono-infected ARTexperienced IDUs; waist girth (r=0.375; P=0.024) in HCV mono-infected IDUs; and waistto- hip ratio (r=-0.872; P=0.048) in HIV and HCV co-infected ART-naive IDUs. Altogether, these results suggest suppression of adiponectin production in treatment-naive HIV monoinfected IDUs and that circulating adiponectin is a useful surrogate marker of altered adiposity in treatment-naive and -experienced HIV and HCV mono- and co-infected IDUs.";https://ec.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/ec/4/4/223.xml;2.0;2.5;2.9;;;;

All rights reserved.Background: Universal access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is still elusive in most developing nations. We asked whether peer support influenced adherence and treatment outcome and if a single viral load (VL) could define treatment failure in a resource-limited setting. Methods: A multicenter longitudinal and cross-sectional survey of VL, CD4 T cells, and adherence in 546 patients receiving HAART for up to 228 months. VL and CD4 counts were determined using m2000 Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay and FACS counters, respectively. Adherence was assessed based on pill count and on self-report. Results: Of the patients, 55.8%, 22.2%, and 22% had good, fair, and poor adherence, respectively. Adherence, peer support, and regimen, but not HIV disclosure, age, or gender, independently correlated with VL and durability of treatment in a multivariate analysis (P < 0.001). Treatment failure was 35.9% using sequential VL but ranged between 27% and 35% using alternate single VL cross-sectional definitions. More patients failed stavudine (41.2%) than zidovudine (37.4%) or tenofovir (28.8%, P 0.043) treatment arms. Peer support correlated positively with adherence ( 2, P < 0.001), with nonadherence being highest in the stavudine arm. VL before the time of regimen switch was comparable between patients switching and not switching treatment. Moreover, 36% of those switching still failed the second-line regimen. Conclusion: Weak adherence support and inaccessible VL testing threaten to compromise the success of HAART scale-up in Kenya. To hasten antiretroviral therapy monitoring and decision making, we suggest strengthening patient-focused adherence programs, optimizing and aligning regimen to WHO standards, and a single point-of-care VL testing when multiple tests are unavailable.;http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201506010-00019;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

Flexible, low-cost, solid, oral fixed-dose combinations (FDC) of LPV/r with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (LPV/r/abacavir [ABC]/lamivudine [3TC] and LPV/r/zidovudine [ZDV]/3TC) are needed to improve both management and adherence of children. This work aimed to develop appropriate drug ratios and dosing for each FDC. Methods: Data from 25 combined datasets included therapeutic drug monitoring and clinical studies from IMPAACT and PENTA. Population pharmacokinetic analyses were performed using Monolix. Monte-Carlo simulations of WHO and FDA dosing recommendations were performed to assess their ability to provide optimal exposure in children weighing 4 to 25 kg based on consensus plasma targets. The LPV/r:3TC:ZDV(ABC) dose ratios were 2.67:1:2(2), respectively. Results: Using WHO dosage, LPV efficacy target was reached in all weight bands. Given the recommended drug ratios, the dosage for the 4-5.9 kg weight band (LPV/ZDV: 120/90 mg twice daily [bid]) showed more than 20% of subjects had ZDV levels at high risk of neutropenia. Reducing the LPV/ZDV dose to 80/60 mg bid decreased frequency of high ZDV concentrations but retained the LPV efficacy criteria. Conclusions: This defined a flexible and simple FDC containing 40 mg LPV, 10 mg ritonavir, 15 mg 3TC and 30 mg ABC or ZDV. According to the weight bands defined by WHO, 4-5.9 kg, 6-9.9 kg, 10-13.9 kg, 14-19.9 kg, 20-24.9 kg, therapeutic doses would be 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 individual units administered by oral route bid.;http://www.intmedpress.com/journals/avt/abstract.cfm?id=2876&pid=48;4.4;4.1;3.9;13596535;;;

We sought to understand the molecular epidemiology of TDR and to identify the HIV-1 drug-resistance mutations responsible for TDR in different regions and virus subtypes.We reviewed all GenBank submissions of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase sequences with or without protease and identified 287 studies published between March 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013, with more than 25 recently or chronically infected ARV-naïve individuals. These studies comprised 50,870 individuals from 111 countries. Each set of study sequences was analyzed for phylogenetic clustering and the presence of 93 surveillance drug-resistance mutations (SDRMs). The median overall TDR prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), south/southeast Asia (SSEA), upper-income Asian countries, Latin America/Caribbean, Europe, and North America was 2.8%, 2.9%, 5.6%, 7.6%, 9.4%, and 11.5%, respectively. In SSA, there was a yearly 1.09-fold (95% CI: 1.05–1.14) increase in odds of TDR since national ARV scale-up attributable to an increase in non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance. The odds of NNRTI-associated TDR also increased in Latin America/Caribbean (odds ratio [OR] = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.06–1.25), North America (OR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.12–1.26), Europe (OR = 1.07; 95% CI: 1.01–1.13), and upper-income Asian countries (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.12–1.55). In SSEA, there was no significant change in the odds of TDR since national ARV scale-up (OR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.92–1.02). An analysis limited to sequences with mixtures at less than 0.5% of their nucleotide positions—a proxy for recent infection—yielded trends comparable to those obtained using the complete dataset. Four NNRTI SDRMs—K101E, K103N, Y181C, and G190A—accounted for >80% of NNRTI-associated TDR in all regions and subtypes. Sixteen nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) SDRMs accounted for >69% of NRTI-associated TDR in all regions and subtypes. In SSA and SSEA, 89% of NNRTI SDRMs were associated with high-level resistance to nevirapine or efavirenz, whereas only 27% of NRTI SDRMs were associated with high-level resistance to zidovudine, lamivudine, tenofovir, or abacavir. Of 763 viruses with TDR in SSA and SSEA, 725 (95%) were genetically dissimilar; 38 (5%) formed 19 sequence pairs. Inherent limitations of this study are that some cohorts may not represent the broader regional population and that studies were heterogeneous with respect to duration of infection prior to sampling.Most TDR strains in SSA and SSEA arose independently, suggesting that ARV regimens with a high genetic barrier to resistance combined with improved patient adherence may mitigate TDR increases by reducing the generation of new ARV-resistant strains. A small number of NNRTI-resistance mutations were responsible for most cases of high-level resistance, suggesting that inexpensive point-mutation assays to detect these mutations may be useful for pre-therapy screening in regions with high levels of TDR. In the context of a public health approach to ARV therapy, a reliable point-of-care genotypic resistance test could identify which patients should receive standard first-line therapy and which should receive a protease-inhibitor-containing regimen.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001810;14.1;15.5;15.5;15491277;e1001810;;

Methods: We performed a multicentre cross-sectional study enrolling HIV-infected patients undergoing neuropsychological testing, with a previous genotypic resistance test on plasma samples. CNS penetrationeffectiveness (CPE) scores and genotypic susceptibility scores (GSS) were calculated for each regimen. A composite score (CPE-GSS) was then constructed. Factors associated with cognitive impairment were investigated by logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 215 patients were included. Mean CPE was 7.1 (95% CI 6.9, 7.3) with 206 (95.8%) patients showing a CPE6. GSS correction decreased the CPE value in 21.4% (mean 6.5, 95% CI 6.3, 6.7), 26.5% (mean 6.4, 95% CI 6.1, 6.6) and 24.2% (mean 6.4, 95% CI 6.2, 6.6) of subjects using ANRS, HIVDB and REGA rules, respectively. Overall, 66 (30.7%) patients were considered cognitively impaired. No significant association could be demonstrated between CPE and cognitive impairment. However, higher GSS-CPE was associated with a lower risk of cognitive impairment (CPE-GSSANRS odds ratio 0.75, P=0.022; CPE-GSSHIVDB odds ratio 0.77, P=0.038; CPE-GSSREGA odds ratio 0.78, P=0.038). Overall, a cutoff of CPE-GSS5 seemed the most discriminatory according to each different interpretation system. Conclusions: GSS-corrected CPE score showed a better correlation with neurocognitive performance than the standard CPE score. These results suggest that antiretroviral drug susceptibility, besides drug CNS penetration, can play a role in the control of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.";http://www.intmedpress.com/journals/avt/abstract.cfm?id=2926&pid=48;4.4;4.1;3.9;13596535;;;

To ensure effective treatment and prevent transmission of drug resistance, affordable treatment monitoring is needed to guide individual treatment.Methods: 125 whole blood samples from patients on first-line ART were investigated for drug resistance mutations using an in-house genotypic testing method. Patients had been on HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors only, with some having been on both HIV and TB treatment. DNA was extracted from whole blood; amplicons were generated by nested PCR and sequenced. Drug resistance mutations were determined using the Stanford HIV drug resistance database. Exact statistics were used to investigate relationships between drug resistance and predisposing factors.Results: From 125 samples, 108 were successfully analyzed for drug resistance mutations. 11 of the 108 sequences had drug resistance mutations; predominantly M184V and Y181C. For a 100-cell increase in CD4 count, the odds of being resistant were 61% lower than those with the baseline CD4 count (p=0.04, CI: 0.34-0.98). There was no association between concurrent HIV/TB treatment and drug resistance (p=0.41).Discussion and Conclusion: Although plasma samples are recommended for genotypic testing, the cost of analyzing plasma RNA makes it less feasible in resource limited settings. Lower cost DNA drug resistance testing from whole blood samples was assessed as a treatment-monitoring tool among patients followed by CD4 and clinical monitoring only. The infrequent detection of resistance and higher CD4 is consistent with effective first-line treatment. Further investigation of proviral DNA as a tool to identify drug resistance mutations is warranted.";http://www.eurekaselect.com/openurl/content.php?genre=article&issn=1570-162X&volume=12&issue=5&spage=309;2.7;2.4;2.3;1570162X;;;

Methods: In a prospective cohort, 300 consecutive patients starting first-line ART were enrolled and followed for 12 months. Among 238 patients with available viral load data at Month 12, logistic regression was used to analyse risk factors for virological failure (1000 HIV RNA copies/mL) including clinical, immunological and virological parameters, as well as data on drug adherence. Population sequencing was performed to detect the presence of drug-resistance mutations in patients with virological failure at Month 12; minority drug-resistance mutations at baseline were analysed using next-generation sequencing in these patients and matched controls. Results: At Month 12, 38/238 (16%) patients experienced virological failure (1000 HIV RNA copies/mL). Patients with virological failure were younger, had lower CD4 cell counts and were more often WHO stage 3 or 4 at baseline. Sixty-three percent of patients with virological failure developed at least one drug-resistance mutation. The M184V (n1/418) and K103N (n1/410) mutationswere most common. At baseline, 6/30 patients (20%) experiencing virological failure and 6/35 (17%) matched controls had evidence of minority drug-resistance mutations using next-generation sequencing (P1/40.77). Lower CD4 count at baseline (OR per 100 cells/mm3 lower 1.41, 95% CI 1.02-1.96, P1/40.04) and poorer adherence (OR per 1% lower 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08, P<0.001) were associated with a higher risk of virological failure. Unavailability of ARTat the treatment centre was the single most common cause for incomplete adherence. Conclusions: Virological failure after 1 year of ART was not associated with minority drug resistance at baseline but with incomplete adherence. Strategies to assure adherence and uninterrupted drug supplies are pivotal factors for therapy success.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dku470;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;dku470;;

We hypothesized that text reminders sent when dosing was late would improve adherence and HIV viral suppression. Methods: Antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive participants, from a South African outpatient ART clinic, were randomized to standard of care (SoC, 3 pretreatment education sessions), or intervention (SoC and automated text reminders if dosing >30 minutes late). Dosing time was recorded by real-time electronic adherence monitoring devices, given to participants at ART start. CD4 cell count and HIV RNA were determined at baseline, 16 and 48 weeks. Primary outcome was cumulative adherence execution by electronic adherence monitoring device. HIV-1 viral suppression (<40 copies/mL) at week 48 and count of treatment interruptions (TIs) >72 hours were secondary outcomes. Analysis was by intention to treat (missing = failure). Registration was with the Pan-African Clinical Trials Registry: PACTR201311000641402. Results: A total of 230 participants were randomly assigned to control (n = 115) or intervention (n = 115) arms. Median adherence was 82.1% (interquartile range, 56.6%-94.6%) in the intervention arm, compared with 80.4% (interquartile range, 52.8%-93.8%) for SoC [adjusted odds ratio for adherence 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.77 to 1.52]. Suppressed HIV RNA (<40 copies/mL) occurred in 80 (69.6%) of control and 75 (65.2%) of intervention (adjusted odds ratio for virological failure in intervention arm 0.77; 95% CI: 0.42 to 1.40). In the intervention arm, the count of TIs of >72 hours was reduced (adjusted incident rate ratio, 0.84; 95% CI: 0.75 to 0.94). Conclusions: Text message reminders linked to late doses detected by real-time adherence monitoring reduced the number of prolonged TIs, but did not significantly improve adherence or viral suppression.";http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201512150-00005;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

However, treatment is only effective until HIV-1 develops resistance against the administered drugs. The most recent antiretroviral drugs have become superior at delaying the evolution of acquired drug resistance. In this review, the viral fitness and its correlation to HIV-1 mutation rates and drug resistance are discussed while emphasizing the concept of lethal mutagenesis as an alternative therapy. The development of resistance to the different classes of approved drugs and the importance of monitoring antiretroviral drug resistance are also summarized briefly.";http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/6/10/4095;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;

In a randomized, double-blind, phase III trial in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive adults (SINGLE), once-daily dolutegravir plus abacavir/lamivudine had noninferior efficacy to once-daily efavirenz/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF)/emtricitabine with regard to establishing and sustaining virological suppression over 144 weeks, and subsequent superiority testing significantly favoured dolutegravir plus abacavir/lamivudine. This outcome was predominantly driven by more favourable rates of discontinuation due to adverse events versus the efavirenz/tenofovir DF/emtricitabine group. These data were generally supported by findings from other phase III trials in ART-naive adults receiving dolutegravir plus either abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir DF/emtricitabine (SPRING-2 and FLAMINGO). Dolutegravir plus abacavir/lamivudine is generally well tolerated, with a tolerability profile that appears to be more favourable than efavirenz/tenofovir DF/emtricitabine. In the SINGLE trial, there were no major treatment-emergent INSTI or NRTI resistance-associated mutations in dolutegravir plus abacavir/lamivudine recipients with protocol-defined virological failure, indicating a high genetic barrier to resistance. Thus, triple combination therapy with abacavir, dolutegravir and lamivudine is an effective, generally well tolerated option for the management of HIV-1 infection, with the convenient once-daily fixed-dose tablet providing the first single-tablet regimen option without tenofovir DF.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40265-015-0361-6;9.4;9.2;9.6;00126667;40265;;

The review will focus on dolutegravir and includes both published data as well as data presented at recent major international HIV/AIDS conferences.Expert opinion: The dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine regimen is highly effective in achieving sustained suppression of HIV-1 RNA plasma concentrations. The STR has a favorable safety profile and a low potential for drug interactions, which will contribute to a prominent role in therapy. As this STR contains abacavir as backbone component, the use requires patients to be HLA-B5701 negative, with good hepatic function. Other first-line treatment combinations are preferred for patients with hepatitis B co-infection or with a high cardiovascular risk.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1517/14740338.2015.1059818;6.3;6.3;6.2;14740338;;;

Main endpoints were viral load levels, CD4+ T cells and toxicities after 48 weeks. Serum inflammation/coagulation markers (ESR, CRP, D-dimer and fibrinogen) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-, adiponectin, resistin) were evaluated. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two arms, with significantly lower values of e-GFR in patients on TDF/FTC. Markers of inflammation/ coagulation and cytokine profile were also similar, except for higher values of resistin in patients on TDF/ FTC. During follow up, CD4+ T cells increased and viral load remained undetectable in both groups. Patient from ZDV/3TC had significantly greater changes in total cholesterol and serum creatinine. Markers of inflammation/ coagulation remained unchanged. Adiponectin significantly increased in patients from ZDV/3TC. Switching to ABC/3TC was effective and safe. Inflammatory markers remained low in both groups. Some changes in metabolic, kidney and cytokine profiles were apparently specific for baseline cART treatment.;None;2.8;2.7;3.2;11217138;;;

We sequenced pol gene from proviral DNA among viremic and suppressed patients to identify drug resistance mutations. Methods: The Peninsula AIDS Research Cohort study enrolled and followed over 2 years 120 HIV infected patients from San Mateo and San Francisco Counties. HIV-1 pol genotyping by bulk sequencing was performed on 38 DNA and RNA from viremic patients and DNA only among 82 suppressed patients at baseline. Antiretroviral susceptibility was predicted by HIVDB.stanford.edu. Results: Among 120 subjects, 81% were on antiretroviral therapy and had been treated for a median time of 7 years. Thirty-two viremic patients showed concordant RNA and DNA genotypes (84%); the discordant profiles were mainly observed in patients with low-level viremia. Among suppressed patients, 21 had drug resistance mutations in proviral DNA (26%) with potential resistance to one, two or three ARV classes in 16, 4 and 1 samples respectively. Conclusions: The high level of genotype concordance between DNA and RNA in viremic patients suggested that DNA genotyping might be used to assess drug resistance in resource-limited settings, and further investigation of extracted DNA from dried blood spots is needed.

All rights reserved. Objectives: Dolutegravir (DTG) has been studied in three trials in HIV treatment-naive participants, showing noninferiority compared with raltegravir (RAL), and superiority compared with efavirenz and ritonavir-boosted darunavir. We explored factors that predicted treatment success, the consistency of observed treatment differences across subgroups and the impact of NRTI backbone on treatment outcome. Design: Retrospective exploratory analyses of data from three large, randomized, international comparative trials: SPRING-2, SINGLE, and FLAMINGO. Methods: We examined the efficacy of DTG in HIV-infected participants with respect to relevant demographic and HIV-1-related baseline characteristics using the primary efficacy endpoint from the studies (FDA snapshot) and secondary endpoints that examine specific elements of treatment response. Regression models were used to analyze pooled data from all three studies. Results: Snapshot response was affected by age, hepatitis co-infection, HIV risk factor, baseline CD4 + cell count, and HIV-1 RNA and by third agent. Differences between DTG and other third agents were generally consistent across these subgroups. There was no evidence of a difference in snapshot response between abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) and tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) overall [ABC/3TC 86%, TDF/FTC 85%, difference 1.1%, confidence interval (CI) -1.8, 4.0 percentage points, P = 0.61] or at high viral loads (difference -2.5, 95% CI -8.9, 3.8 percentage points, P = 0.42). Conclusions: DTG is a once-daily, unboosted integrase inhibitor that is effective in combination with either ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC for first-line antiretroviral therapy in HIV-positive individuals with a variety of baseline characteristics.;http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201501140-00004;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

However, RAMs for rilpivirine and etravirine cannot be reported on previous resistance genotypes because these specific RAMs were not analyzed at that time. Therefore, our objective was to determine, in virologically suppressed HIV-1-infected individuals, the presence of RAMs to rilpivirine, etravirine and the combination of tenofovir/emtricitabine/rilpivirine in HIV-1 DNA from individuals previously exposed to efavirenz and/or nevirapine. Methods: The studied population included 169 treatment-experienced individuals enrolled in the ANRS 138-EASIER trial who previously failed on and/or were intolerant to efavirenz and/or nevirapine and who had plasma HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL. Resistance to rilpivirine, etravirine, tenofovir and emtricitabine by bulk sequencing was performed on extracted HIV-1 DNA from whole blood collected at the time of trial inclusion. Results: Reverse transcriptase gene amplification was successful in 128/169 (76%) individuals and 95% of HIV-1 were infected with subtype B. Rilpivirine RAMs were detected in 41 (32%) individuals, with highest frequency for the mutations Y181C/I/V (18%), K101E/P (7%) and E138A/G/K/Q/R/S (6%) and the association L100I?+?K103N/S (5%). Etravirine RAMs were detected in five (4%) individuals. Resistance to emtricitabine, tenofovir and at least one drug included in the combination of tenofovir/emtricitabine/rilpivirine were detected in 72 (56%), 12 (9%) and 88 (69%), respectively. Conclusions: In individuals with suppressed viraemia under antiretroviral therapy (ART), but who had been previously exposed to an efavirenz and/or nevirapine-based regimen, rilpivirine RAMs are frequent and etravirine RAMs are rare. This finding suggests that the switch to a rilpivirine-based regimen should not be recommended.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dku395;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

Available options for patients at risk of cardiovascular disease include antiretroviral drugs with improved lipid profiles. Dolutegravir is one of a new generation of HIV integrase inhibitors recently incorporated into the US Department of Health and Human Services, German, Spanish, and Italian HIV treatment guidelines as a preferred first-line third agent in combination with dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone therapies. To understand the lipid profile of dolutegravir in the context of combination ART, we analyzed the lipid outcomes at 48 weeks in ART-naive participants in four phase IIb–IIIb clinical trials.Methods: Variables included in this analysis were total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C), TC/HDL ratio, and triglycerides at baseline and week 48.Results: In a comparative analysis, dolutegravir demonstrated a broadly neutral effect on lipids versus efavirenz or ritonavir-boosted darunavir; in both comparisons, patients taking dolutegravir exhibited smaller increases in TC, LDL-C, and triglyceride levels. In comparison with raltegravir, dolutegravir exhibited a similar lipid profile, including small increases in TC, LDL-C, and triglyceride levels for both agents. In the pooled dolutegravir analysis, minimal increases in LDL-C and triglycerides were observed but mean values at 48 weeks remained below National Cholesterol Education Program target levels. HDL-C levels increased at 48 weeks, and the mean TC/HDL-C ratio was 0.6 at 48 weeks; these values are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.Conclusions: Together, these data show that dolutegravir has a safer lipid profile in combination ART and provides an important treatment option for older patients who may have other risk factors for metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular disease.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40261-014-0266-2;3.7;3.5;3.9;11732563;;;

We aimed to assess the effect of a cART regimen intensified with raltegravir and maraviroc, compared with standard triple-drug cART, on HIV-DNA load. Methods: In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients from hospitals across France. Inclusion criteria were primary HIV-1 infection (an incomplete HIV-1 western blot and detectable plasma HIV-RNA), with either symptoms or a CD4+ cell count below 500 cells per L. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to an intensive, five-drug cART regimen (raltegravir 400 mg and maraviroc 150 mg twice daily, and a fixed-dose combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 g plus emtricitabine 200 g, darunavir 800 g, and ritonavir 100 g once daily) or a standard triple-drug cART regimen (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 g plus emtricitabine 200 g, darunavir 800 g, and ritonavir 100 g once daily) using a predefined randomised list generated by randomly selected variable block sizes. The primary endpoint was the median number of HIV-DNA copies per 106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at month 24, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population, defined as all patients who started their assigned treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01033760. Findings: Between April 26, 2010, and July 13, 2011, 110 patients were enrolled, of whom 92 were randomly assigned and 90 started treatment (45 in each treatment group). Six (13%) patients in the intensive cART group and two (4%) in the standard cART group discontinued before month 24. At month 24, HIV-DNA loads were similar between groups (2·35 [IQR 2·05-2·50] log10 per 106 PBMC in the intensive cART group vs 2·25 [1·71-2·55] in the standard cART group; p=0·21). Eight grade 3-4 clinical adverse events were reported in seven patients in the intensive cART group and seven grade 3-4 clinical adverse events were reported in seven patients in the standard cART group. Three serious clinical adverse events occurred: two (pancreatitis and lipodystrophy) in the standard cART group, which were regarded as treatment related, and one event (suicide attempt) in the intensive cART group that was unrelated to treatment. Interpretation: After 24 months, cART intensified with raltegravir and maraviroc did not have a greater effect on HIV blood reservoirs than did standard cART. These results should help to design future trials of treatments aiming to decrease the HIV reservoir in patients with primary HIV-1 infection.

To investigate these questions, we measured T cell frequencies and markers of memory, activation, anergy, and homing in the blood, ileum, and rectum of HIV- and ART-suppressed HIV+ adults. In HIV- individuals, T cell frequencies and phenotypes differed significantly between sites. Compared to HIV- adults, HIV+ adults had lower absolute CD4+T cell counts in the ileal lamina propria and lower relative CD4+T cell counts in the blood and ileum. In the gut, HIV+ adults had a higher proportion of CD38+ CD4+T cells, a lower proportion of terminally-differentiated effector cells, and, in the rectum, a higher proportion of CTLA-4+ CD4+T cells. In HIV+ individuals, relative CD4+T cell numbers in the ileum correlated with the proportion of CTLA-4+ CD4+T cells, whereas in the rectum, they tended to correlate with the proportion of circulating CD4+T cells expressing 47 or CCR6. Mechanisms of T cell reconstitution may differ throughout the gut, with homing contributing more in the rectum while ileal reconstitution is associated with mucosal CD4+T cell anergy.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0121290;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0121290;;

Methods: We analyzed data from our multicenter cohort study with 444 antiretroviral-naive participants recruited between 2008 and 2010. HIV-1 subtype and tropism were determined by V3 sequencing, and TDR/DRM was determined by Pol sequencing. Virologic and immunologic responses were monitored over 96 weeks of follow-up. The initial combination antiretroviral therapy regimen for all patients was nevirapine + lamivudine + zidovudine or stavudine. Analysis 1 included patients who finished 96 weeks of follow-up (n 379), and analysis 2 included all 444 patients. Results: Subtype B/B was associated with higher prevalence of TDR/DRM to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Median time to HIV-1 suppression was 18 weeks in all 3 subtype groups. In Cox proportional models for viral suppression, neither viral tropism nor HIV-1 subtypes had any impact on viral suppression; however, subtypes CRF01-AE and C/CRF07-BC/CRF08-BC were associated with lower risk of virologic failure compared with subtype B/B, with adjusted hazard ratio of 0.11 (P 0.032) and 0.06 (P 0.036), respectively in analysis 1, 0.42 (P 0.047) and 0.22 (P 0.008), respectively in analysis 2.

Methods: CLinic-based ART Diagnostic Evaluation (CLADE) is a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) evaluating feasibility, superiority, and cost-effectiveness of routine VL vs. standard of care (clinical and immunological) monitoring in adults initiating dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)+non-NRTI ART. Participants were randomized (1:1) at 7 predominately rural, non-research, district-level clinics of western Kenya. Descriptive statistics present accrual patterns and baseline cohort characteristics. Results: Over 15 months, 820 adults enrolled at 7 sites with 86-152 enrolled per site. Monthly site enrollment ranged from 2-92 participants. Full (100%) informed consent compliance was independently documented. Half (49.9%) had HIV diagnosed through voluntary counseling and testing. Study arms were similar: mostly females (57.6%) aged 37.6 (SD = 9.0) years with low CD4 (166 [SD = 106]) cells/m 3). Notable proportions had WHO Stage III or IV disease (28.7%), BMI <18.5 kg/m2 (23.1%), and a history of tuberculosis (5.6%) or were receiving tuberculosis treatment (8.2%) at ART initiation. In the routine VL arm, 407/409 (99.5%) received baseline VL (234,577 SD = 151,055 copies/ml). All participants received lamivudine; 49.8% started zidovudine followed by 38.4% stavudine and 11.8% tenofovir; and, 64.4% received nevirapine as nNRTI (35.6% efavirenz). Conclusions: A RCT can be enrolled successfully in rural, non-research, resource limited, district-level clinics in western Kenya. Many adults presenting for ART have advanced HIV/AIDS, emphasizing the importance of universal HIV testing and linkage-to-care campaigns.

Methods: This Europe-wide case-control study included ART-naive subjects infected with drug-susceptible HIV-1 as revealed by population sequencing, who achieved virological suppression on first-line ART including one NNRTI. Cases experienced virological failure and controls were subjects from the same cohort whose viraemia remained suppressed at a matched time since initiation of ART. Blinded, centralized 454 pyrosequencing with parallel bioinformatic analysis in two laboratories was used to identify MVs in the 1%-25% frequency range. ORs of virological failure according to MV detection were estimated by logistic regression. Results: Two hundred and sixty samples (76 cases and 184 controls), mostly subtype B (73.5%),were used for the analysis. Identical MVs were detected in the two laboratories. 31.6% of cases and 16.8% of controls harboured pre-existing MVs. Detection of at least one MV versus no MVs was associated with an increased risk of virological failure (OR=2.75, 95% CI=1.35-5.60, P=0.005); similar associations were observed for at least one MV versus no NRTIMVs (OR=2.27, 95% CI=0.76-6.77, P=0.140) and at least oneMV versus no NNRTIMVs (OR=2.41, 95% CI=1.12-5.18, P=0.024).

Methods: A randomized, 12 week, open-label, comparative study of the impact on lipids of continuation of abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) plus efavirenz (EFV) or replacement with the single tablet regimen of EFV/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF (EFV/FTC/TDF) in hypercholesterolaemic subjects on successful antiretroviral therapy, with a 12-week extension with all subjects on EFV/FTC/TDF. Results: 157 subjects received study drug, 79 switched to EFV/FTC/TDF and 78 subjects continued ABC/3TC+EFV. At Week 12, 73 subjects on ABC/3TC+EFV switched to EFV/FTC/TDF. The switch was well tolerated and no subject experienced viral rebound. Median baseline fasting total cholesterol was 6.32mmol/L. 12 weeks following switch, the difference in the means (LSM) between treatment groups (EFV/FTC/TDF minus ABC/3TC+EFV) in total cholesterol change from baseline was -0.74mmol/l (95% CI -1.00, -0.47, p < 0.001). The median change from baseline in total cholesterol following switch in the EFV/FTC/TDF arm was -0.86mmol/l (p < 0.001) compared with +0.01mmol/l (p = 0.45) in the continuation arm at Week 12. Significant (p < 0.001) differences between treatment groups following switch were seen for all lipid fractions from baseline to Week 12: LDL cholesterol (-0.47 mmol/L [-0.70, -0.25]), HDL cholesterol (-0.15 mmol/L [-0.21, -0.08]), triglycerides (-0.43 mmol/L [-0.75, -0.11]), and non HDL cholesterol (-0.56 mmol/L [-0.80, -0.31]). In the extension phase, similar declines in total cholesterol were observed with a median change from Week 12 to Week 24 of -0.73mmol/L (p < 0.001).

This study investigated the antiretroviral drug resistance patterns in South African HIV-1 subtype C-infected patients failing stavudine- (d4T) and tenofovir- (TDF) based first-line regimens and assess the suitability of TDF as the preferred first-line nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). Methods Resistance patterns of HIV-1 from 160 adult patients virologically failing TDF- (n = 80) and d4T- (n = 80) based first-line regimens were retrospectively analyzed. The pol gene was sequenced using an in-house protocol and mutations were analysed using the IAS-USA 2014 Drug Resistance Mutation list. Results Compared to d4T-exposed patients (n = 7), patients failing on a TDF-containing regimen (n = 43) were almost 5 times more likely to present with a K65R mutation (aRR 4.86 95% CI 2.29 - 10.34). Y115F was absent in the d4T group, and detected in 13.8% (n = 11) of TDF-exposed patients, p = 0.0007. Virus from 9 of the 11 patients (82.0%) who developed the Y115F mutation also developed K65R. Intermediate or high-level resistance to most NRTIs was common in the TDF-treatment group, but these patients twice more likely to remain susceptible to AZT as compared to those exposed to d4T (aRR 2.09 95% CI 1.13 - 3.90). Conclusion The frequency of the TDF induced K65R mutation was higher in our setting compared to non-subtype C dominated countries. However, despite the higher frequency of crossresistance to NRTIs, most patients remained susceptible to AZT, which is reflected in the South African treatment guidelines that recommend AZT as an essential component of sec-ond-line regimens.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118145;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0118145;;

The accumulation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) resistance mutations can compromise treatment out- comes and promote transmission of drug-resistant virus. We conducted a study to determine the duration and evolution of genotypic drug resistance in the female genital tract among HIV-1-infected women failing first-line therapy. Methods. Treatment failure was diagnosed based on World Health Organization (WHO) clinical or immunologic criteria, and second-line therapy was initiated. Stored plasma and genital samples were tested to determine the presence and timing of virologic failure and emergence of drug resistance. The median duration of genital shedding of genotypically resistant virus prior to regimen switch was estimated. Results. Nineteen of 184 women were diagnosed with treatment failure, of whom 12 (63.2%) had confirmed virologic failure at the switch date. All 12 women with virologic failure (viral load, 5855-1 086 500 copies/mL) had dual-class resistance in plasma. Seven of the 12 (58.3%) had genital HIV-1 RNA levels high enough to amplify (673-116 494 copies/swab), all with dual-class re- sistance. The median time from detection of resistance in stored samples to regimen switch was 895 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 130-1414 days) for plasma and 629 days (95% CI, 341-984 days) for genital tract secretions. Conclusions. Among women diagnosed with treatment failure using WHO clinical or immunologic criteria, over half had vi- rologic failure confirmed in stored samples. Resistant HIV-1 RNA was shed in the genital tract at detectable levels for 1.7 years before failure diagnosis, with steady accumulation of mutations. These findings add urgency to the ongoing scale-up of viral load testing in resource-limited settings.

This study included 53 HIV-1 positive individuals. We evaluated the ability of effector cells and antibodies to mediate ADCC separately and in combination using the ADCC-PanToxiLux assay. The ability of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to mediate ADCC was significantly higher in individuals who had been treated with ART before seroconversion, compared to the individuals initiating ART at a low CD4+ T cell count (<350 cells/l blood) and the ART-naïve individuals. The frequency of CD16 expressing natural killer (NK) cells correlated with both the duration of ART and Granzyme B (GzB) activity. In contrast, the plasma titer of antibodies mediating ADCC declined during ART. These findings suggest improved cytotoxic function of the NK cells if initiating ART early during infection, while the levels of ADCC mediating antibodies declined during ART.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0145249;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0145249;;

We evaluated the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of TDF in treatment-experienced children during 96 weeks. Methods: This was a prospective, open-label study in HIV-infected children 3-18 years of age (15 kg), with viral suppression on their first-line regimen without tenofovir. Children were given TDF/lamivudine/efavirenz once daily at entry; TDF was prescribed according to weight bands. Age-, gender- and CD4-matched controls receiving TDF-sparing regimens were concomitantly enrolled. Tenofovir pharmacokinetic assessment was performed at week 4. CD4 counts, HIV-1 RNA viral load and safety assessments were determined at baseline, 24, 48 and 96 weeks. Results: Eighty children were enrolled (40 per group); 35 (44%) were male. Median age was 12.2 (range 3.1-17.7) years. The median administered dose was 214 mg/m2. Tenofovir geometric mean AUC0-24 hours, Cmax and C24 hours were 2.66 [90% confidence interval (CI) 2.49-2.84] g hours/mL, 0.26 (0.24-0.29) g/mL and 0.057 (0.052-0.062) g/mL, respectively. Estimated glomerular filtration rate did not significantly change overtime. The fractional excretion of calcium slightly increased but fractional excretion of phosphate was unchanged among children in TDF group. The bone mineral density Z score decreased in the first 24 weeks of TDF treatment and was stable afterward. The TDF group had lower cholesterol levels (P = 0.001). Thirty-nine of 40 children remained virologically suppressed. No serious adverse event related to tenofovir. Conclusion: TDF substitution in children and adolescents who were otherwise stable while receiving a first-line nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimen achieved adequate exposure without clinically significant renal or bone adverse events over 96 weeks. While reassuring, these preliminary safety findings may not exclude delayed effects on renal function and bone density.";http://journals.lww.com/00006454-201504000-00012;4.7;4.4;3.9;08913668;;;

Methods: Subjects (2 to <16 years) on a stavudine (d4T) or zidovudine (ZDV) containing regimen with HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL were randomized to either switch d4T or ZDV to TDF or continue d4T or ZDV. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL at Week 48 with a prespecified noninferiority margin of 15%. After the 48-week randomized phase, eligible subjects were rolled over to an extension phase. Results: Ninety-seven children (48 TDF vs. 49 d4T or ZDV) were randomized and treated. The percent of subjects who maintained virologic suppression in the TDF versus d4T or ZDV group at Week 24 were 93.8% versus 89.8% (difference 4.0%; 95% confidence interval:: -6.9% to 14.9%) and at Week 48 were 83.3% versus 91.8% (difference: -8.5%; 95% confidence interval: -21.5% to 4.5%; missing = failure, intent-to-treat analysis). No subjects discontinued study drug because of an adverse event in the 48 weeks of randomized phase. Four subjects discontinued TDF because of proximal renal tubulopathy in the extension phase. Conclusions: Our study did not demonstrate noninferiority of TDF versus d4T or ZDV at Week 48. Overall safety and tolerability of TDF in children were consistent with adults. TDF may be considered as an alternative to d4T or ZDV in HIV-infected children.";http://journals.lww.com/00006454-201504000-00010;4.7;4.4;3.9;08913668;;;

We partially sequenced the envelope C2V3 gene from a total of 59 Kenyan patients on highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) and determined HIV subtypes using both the JPHMM subtyping tool and the phylogenetic method. HIV-1 subtype A1 was the predominant strain in circulation, representing 65.5% and 74.5% of all isolates as determined by JPHMM and phylogenetic methods, respectively. Subtypes C and D were the next most prevalent pure strains at 9.1% each by both methods. JPHMM identified 9.1% of the isolates as recombinant. Four isolates had short sequences not covering the entire C2V3 region and were thus not subtyped. From this study, subtype A viruses are still the predominant HIV-1 strains in local circulation in Kenya. Constant surveillance is needed to update molecular trends under continuing HAART scale-up.;http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2014.0306;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

Results We enrolled 1,498 participants; 5.9% were failing at baseline. Median time from enrollment to receipt of results was 42 days; 79.6% of participants received results within 3 months. Among participants with confirmed elevated VL, 92.6%initiated second-line therapy; 90.7% were switched within 365 days of VL testing. Nearly one-third (30.8%) of participants with elevated baseline VL had suppressed (<5,000 copies/ml) on confirmatory testing. Median period between enrollment and specimen testing was 23 days. Adjusting for relevant covariates, participants on ART >4 years were more likely to be failing than participants on therapy 1-4 years (RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.8); older participants were less likely to be failing (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.98). There was no difference in likelihood of failure based on clinical symptoms (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.65-2.11). Conclusions DBS for VL monitoring is feasible and effective in real-world clinical settings. Centralized DBS testing may increase access to VL monitoring in remote settings. Programmatic outcomes are encouraging, especially proportion of eligible participants switched to secondline therapy.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0124748;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0124748;;

Baseline genotypic resistance testing is considered standard of care in most developed areas of the world. The aim of this analysis was to characterize HIV-1 TDR and the use of resistance testing in START trial participants. Methods: In the Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) trial, baseline genotypic resistance testing results were collected at study entry and analysed centrally to determine the prevalence of TDR in the study population. Resistance was based on a modified 2009 World Health Organization definition to reflect newer resistance mutations. Results: Baseline resistance testing was available in 1946 study participants. Higher rates of testing occurred in Europe (86.7%), the USA (81.3%) and Australia (89.9%) as compared with Asia (22.2%), South America (1.8%) and Africa (0.1%). The overall prevalence of TDR was 10.1%, more commonly to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (4.5%) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (4%) compared with protease inhibitors (2.8%). The most frequent TDR mutations observed were M41L, D67N/G/E, T215F/Y/I/S/C/D/E/V/N, 219Q/E/N/R, K103N/S, and G190A/S/E in reverse transcriptase, and M46I/L and L90M in protease. By country, the prevalence of TDR was highest in Australia (17.5%), France (16.7%), the USA (12.6%) and Spain (12.6%). No participant characteristics were identified as predictors of the presence of TDR. Conclusions: START participants enrolled in resource-rich areas of the world were more likely to have baseline resistance testing. In Europe, the USA and Australia, TDR prevalence rates varied by country.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/hiv.12236;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;

However, the effectiveness of this approach has not been established. Methods: We performed a retrospective study evaluating the rates of treatment failure, virological failure (VF), and variables associated, in all subjects initiating this switch combination in our clinic since 2001. Analyses were performed by a modified intention to treat, where switch due to toxicity equalled failure. The main endpoint was plasma HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL. Results: 341 patients were treated for a median of 176 (57; 308) weeks. At week 48, 306 (89.7%) subjects had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL, 10 (2.9%) experienced VF, and 25 (7.4%) discontinued the treatment due to toxicity. During the whole follow-up 23 (6.7%) individuals (17 on lamivudine, 6 on emtricitabine; p = 0.034) developed VF and treatment modification due to toxicity occurred in 36 (10.7%). Factors independently associated with VF in a multivariate analysis were: intravenous drug use (HR 1.51; 95%CI 1.12, 2.04), time with undetectable viral load before the switch (HR 0.98; 0.97, 0.99), number of prior NRTIs (HR 1.49; 1.15, 1.93) or NNRTIs (HR 3.22; 1.64, 6.25), and previous NVP (HR 1.54; 1.10, 2.17) or efavirenz (HR 5.76; 1.11, 29.87) unscheduled interruptions. VF was associated with emergence of usual nevirapine mutations (Y181C/I/D, K103N and V106A/I), M184V (n = 16; 12 with lamivudine vs. 4 with emtricitabine, p = 0.04), and K65R (n = 7). Conclusions: The rates of treatment failure at 48 weeks, or long-term toxicity or VF with this switch regimen are low and no unexpected mutations or patterns of mutations were selected in subjects with treatment failure.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0128131;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0128131;;

We examined the relationship between presence of P. falciparum DNA in plasma samples and clinical malaria as well as the impact of atazanavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI), on P. falciparum PCR positivity. Methods ACTG study A5175 compared two NNRTI-based regimens and one PI-based anti-retroviral (ARV) regimen in antiretroviral therapy naïve participants. We performed nested PCR on plasma samples for the P. falciparum 18s rRNA gene to detect the presence of malaria DNA in 215 of the 221 participants enrolled in Blantyre and Lilongwe, Malawi. We also studied the closest sample preceding the first malaria diagnosis from 102 persons with clinical malaria and randomly selected follow up samples from 88 persons without clinical malaria. Results PCR positivity was observed in 18 (8%) baseline samples and was not significantly associated with age, sex, screening CD4+ T-cell count, baseline HIV-1 RNA level or co-trimoxazole use within the first 8 weeks. Neither baseline PCR positivity (p = 0.45) nor PCR positivity after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (p = 1.0) were significantly associated with subsequent clinical malaria. Randomization to the PI versus NNRTI ARV regimens was not significantly associated with either PCR positivity (p = 0.5) or clinical malaria (p = 0.609). Clinical malaria was associated with a history of tuberculosis (p = 0.006) and a lower BMI (p = 0.004). Conclusion P. falciparum DNA was detected in 8% of participants at baseline, but was not significantly associated with subsequent development of clinical malaria. HIV PI therapy did not decrease the prevalence of PCR positivity or incidence of clinical disease.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0129519;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0129519;;

Although naturally occurring amino acid variation has been less frequently observed in the integrase region, the functional constraints of this variation on primary INSTI resistance-associated mutations are not fully understood. In the present study, we focused on the S119G/R/P/T (S119X) polymorphisms, which are frequently observed in HIV-1 sequences derived from clinical specimens (naïve, n = 458, 26%). The frequency of the S119X polymorphism together with Q148H/R (n = 8, 63%) or N155H (n = 12, 83%) was relatively high compared with that of naïve group. Our in vitro assays revealed that S119G/P/T alone exerted no effect on the susceptibility to INSTIs, whereas S119R enhanced the level of INSTI resistance induced by well-known INSTI resistance-associated mutations (Y143C, Q148H or N155H). Notably, the S119R polymorphism contributed to a significant (5.9-fold) increase in dolutegravir resistance caused by G140S/Q148H. Analysis of two cases of virological failure during raltegravir-based therapy showed that the accumulation and the rapid evolution of primary INSTI resistance-associated mutations coincided with the S119R mutation. These data highlight the role of the S119X polymorphism in INSTI resistance, and this polymorphism might be linked to the potential treatment outcome with INSTI-based therapy.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166354215001060;7.4;7.3;7.4;01663542;3626;;

Mechanisms contributing to Th17 deficit are not fully elucidated. Here we investigated alterations in the Th17 polarization potential of naive-like CD4+ T-cells, depletion of Th17-commited subsets during HIV pathogenesis, and Th17 restoration in response to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Results: Peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells expressing a naive-like phenotype (CD45RA+CCR7+) from chronically HIV-infected subjects receiving ART (CI on ART; median CD4 counts 592 cells/l; viral load: <50 HIV-RNA copies/ml; time since infection: 156 months) compared to uninfected controls (HIV-) were impaired in their survival and Th17 polarization potential in vitro. In HIV- controls, IL-17A-producing cells mainly originated from naive-like T-cells with a regulatory phenotype (nTregs: CD25highCD127-FoxP3+) and from CD25+CD127+FoxP3- cells (DP, double positive). Th17-polarized conventional naive CD4+ T-cells (nT: CD25-CD127+FoxP3-) also produced IL17A, but at lower frequency compared to nTregs and DP. In CI on ART subjects, the frequency/counts of nTreg and DP were significantly diminished compared to HIV- controls, and this paucity was further associated with decreased proportions of memory T-cells producing IL-17A and expressing Th17 markers (CCR6+CD26+CD161+, mTh17). nTregs and DP compared to nT cells harbored superior levels of integrated/non-integrated HIV-DNA in CI on ART subjects, suggesting that permissiveness to integrative/abortive infection contributes to impaired survival and Th17 polarization of lineage-committed cells. A cross-sectional study in CI on ART subjects revealed that nTregs, DP and mTh17 counts were negatively correlated with the time post-infection ART was initiated and positively correlated with nadir CD4 counts. Finally, a longitudinal analysis in a HIV primary infection cohort demonstrated a tendency for increased nTreg, DP, and mTh17 counts with ART initiation during the first year of infection. Conclusions: These results support a model in which the paucity of phenotypically naive nTregs and DP cells, caused by integrative/abortive HIV infection and/or other mechanisms, contributes to Th17 deficiency in HIV-infected subjects. Early ART initiation, treatment intensification with integrase inhibitors, and/or other alternative interventions aimed at preserving/restoring the pool of cells prone to acquire Th17 functions may significantly improve mucosal immunity in HIV-infected subjects.";http://www.retrovirology.com/content/12/1/38;7.3;6.7;6.7;;38;;

The 2014 guidelines were developed by the collaborations of the Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and the Thai AIDS Society (TAS). One of the major changes in the guidelines included recommending to initiating ART irrespective of CD4 cell count. However, it is with an emphasis that commencing HAART at CD4 cell count above 500 cell/mm3 is for public health, in term of preventing HIV transmission and personal benefit. In tuberculosis co-infected patients with CD4 cell counts 50 cells/mm3 or with CD4 cell counts >50 cells/mm3 who have severe clinical disease, ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of starting tuberculosis treatment. The preferred initial ART regimen in treatment naïve patients is efavirenz combined with tenofovir and emtricitabine or lamivudine. Plasma HIV viral load assessment should be done twice a year until achieving undetectable results; and will then be monitored once a year. CD4 cell count should be monitored every 6 months until CD4 cell count 350 cells/mm3 and with plasma HIV viral load <50 copies/mL; then it should be monitored once a year afterward. HIV drug resistance genotypic test is indicated when plasma HIV viral load >1,000 copies/mL while on ART. Ritonavir-boosted lopinavir or atazanavir in combination with optimized two nucleoside-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors is recommended after initial ART regimen failure.

This study was to evaluate whether the safety and efficacy outcomes of three initial antiretroviral regimens (ARVs) differed by sex. Methods: Antiretroviral regimen naive participants from nine countries in four continents were assigned to ARVs with efavirenz (EFV) plus lamivudine-zidovudine, atazanavir (ATV) plus didanosine (ddI)-EC/emtricitabine (FTC) or EFV plus FTC-tenofovir-DF. The primary objective was to estimate the sex difference on efficacy outcome of treatment failure defined as one of the following: 1. Time to 1st of confirmed virologic failure, 2. WHO Stage 4 progression or 3. death with hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) from adjusted Cox regression models. Results: In all, 739 (47%) women and 832 (53%) men with HIV were evaluated. Women had higher pretreatment CD4z(182 vs 165 cells/mm3; Pv0.001) and lower HIV-1 RNA (4.9 log10 vs 5.2 log10 copies/ml; Pv0.001) compared to men. Association of sex with time to regimen failure differed by treatment arm (P50.018). For atazanavir plus didanosine-EC plus emtricitabine, women had a longer time to treatment failure compared to men [adjusted HR (aHR)50.59; 95% CI 0.40-0.87]. Women were less likely to prematurely discontinue treatment prematurely (aHR50.74; 95% CI 0.56-0.98).

Methods: Participants were HIV-1-infected partners randomized to early ART (CD4 350-550) in HPTN052 (n 886, median follow-up 2.1 years), a clinical trial of early ART to prevent sexual transmission of HIV-1 in serodiscordant couples at 13 sites in 9 countries. Adherence was assessed through pill count (dichotomized at <95%) and through self-report items. Predictors of adherence were mental health and general health perceptions, substance use, binge drinking, social support, sexual behaviors, and demographics. Viral suppression was defined as HIV plasma viral load <400 copies per milliliter. Adherence counseling and couples' counseling about safer sex were provided. Logistic and linear regression models using generalized estimating equation for repeated measurements were used. Findings: Through pill count, 82% of participants were adherent at 1 month and 83.3% at 1 year. Mental health was the only psychosocial variable associated with adherence [pill count, odds ratios (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.00 to 1.11; self-report parameter estimate, OR 0.02, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.04], although regional differences emerged.

Interpretation: Although adherence was high among individuals in stable relationships taking ART for prevention, mental health and adherence covaried. Assessing and intervening on mental health in the context of promoting adherence to ART as prevention should be explored. Adherence and couples' counseling, feedback about viral suppression, and/or altruism may also help explain the magnitude of adherence observed.";http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201506010-00014;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

We randomly assigned patients (1:1; stratified by active hepatitis C virus infection and previous treatment; computer-generated random number sequence) to dual treatment with oral atazanavir (300 mg once daily) and ritonavir (100 mg once daily) plus lamivudine (300 mg once daily) or triple treatment with oral atazanavir (300 mg once daily) and ritonavir (100 mg once daily) plus two nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors at the discretion of the investigators. The primary endpoint was virological response, defined as HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies per mL at week 48, in the per-protocol population, with a non-inferiority margin of 12%. We included patients who received at least one dose of the study drug in the safety analysis. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01307488. Findings: Between Sept 29, 2011, and May 2, 2013, we randomly assigned 286 patients (143 [50%] to each group). At week 48 in the per-protocol population, 112 (84%) of 133 patients had virological response in the dual-treatment group versus 105 (78%) of 135 in the triple-treatment group (difference 6% [95% CI -5 to 16%), showing non-inferiority at the prespecified level. 14 (5%) patients developed severe adverse events (dual treatment six [4%]; triple treatment eight [6%]), none of which we deemed related to the study drug. Grade 3-4 adverse events were similar between groups (dual treatment 77 [55%] of 140; triple treatment 78 [55%] of 141). Treatment discontinuations were less frequent in the dual-treatment group (three [2%]) than in the triple-treatment group (ten [7%]; p=0·047). Interpretation: In our trial, dual treatment was effective, safe, and non-inferior to triple treatment in patients with an HIV-1 infection who are virologically suppressed who switch antiretroviral therapy because of toxic effects, intolerance, or simplification. This combination has the potential to suppress some of the long-term toxic effects associated with nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, preserve future treatment options, and reduce the cost of antiretroviral therapy.

In phase II and III trials, this interferon-free regimen, taken ± ribavirin, provided high rates of sustained virological response 12 weeks post-treatment in adults with chronic HCV genotype 1a or 1b infection, including those with compensated cirrhosis, liver transplants or HIV-1 coinfection. The regimen was generally well tolerated, with nausea, insomnia, asthenia, pruritus, other skin reactions and fatigue being among the most common tolerability issues. Thus, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir is an effective interferon-free, direct-acting antiviral regimen for use ± ribavirin in a broad range of adults chronically infected with HCV genotype 1.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40265-015-0412-z;9.4;9.2;9.6;00126667;412;;

The underlying mechanism(s) may involve chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and immune cell activation. Dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitors (sitagliptin) improve glucose tolerance and may possess immunomodulatory effects because leukocyte CD26 cell surface receptors express dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity. Objective: Sitagliptin will reduce inflammatory and immune cell activation markers known to be elevated in cART-treated HIV-infected (HIV+) adults with impaired glucose tolerance. Design: This was designed as a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of sitagliptin in HIV+ adults. Setting: The setting was an academic medical center. Patients: Patients were cART-treated HIV+ men and women (n = 36) with stable HIV disease and impaired glucose tolerance. Interventions: Interventions included sitagliptin 100 mg/d or placebo for 8 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: At baseline and week 8, plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 concentrations (ELISA), oral glucose tolerance,andabdominal sc adipose mRNAexpression forM1macrophage markers (monocyte chemotactic protein-1, EGF-like modulecontaining, mucin-like hormone receptor 1). Results: Sitagliptin reduced glucose area under the curve (P=.002) and improved oral glucose insulin sensitivity index (P=.04) more than placebo. Sitagliptin reduced plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 levels more than placebo (P=.009). Adipose tissue monocyte chemotactic protein-1mRNAabundance declined significantly more (P<01), and adipose EGF-like module-containing, mucin-like hormone receptor 1 mRNA expression tended to decline more (P=.19) in sitagliptin than placebo. Conclusion: Sitagliptin had beneficial systemic and adipose anti-inflammatory effects in cARTtreated HIV+ adults with impaired glucose tolerance.

We assessed the prevalence of both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections among injecting heroin users (IHUs) at the Kenyan Coast. Methods A total of 186 IHUs (mean age, 33 years) from the Omari rehabilitation center program in Malindi were consented and screened for HIV-1 and HCV by serology and PCR and their CD4 T-cells enumerated by FACS. Results Prevalence of HIV-1 was 87.5%, that of HCV was 16.4%, co-infection was 17.9% and 18/152 (11.8%) were uninfected. Only 5.26%of the HIV-1 negative injectors were HCV positive. Co-infection was higher among injectors aged 30 to 40 years (20.7%) and among males (22.1%) than comparable groups. About 35% of the injectors were receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART). Co-infection was highest among injectors receiving D4T (75%) compared to those receiving AZT (21.6%) or TDF (10.5%) or those not on ART (10.5%). Mean CD4 T-cells were 404 (95% CI, 365-443) cells/mm3 overall, significantly lower for co-infected (mean, 146; 95% CI 114 - 179 cells/mm3) than HIV mono infected (mean, 437, 95% CI 386 - 487 cells/mm3, p<0.001) or uninfected (mean, 618, 95% CI 549 - 687 cells/mm3, p<0.001) injectors and lower for HIV mono-infected than uninfected injectors (p=0.002). By treatment arm, CD4 T-cells were lower for injectors receiving D4T (mean, 78; 95% CI, 0.4 - 156 cells/mm3) than TDF (mean 607, 95% CI, 196 - 1018 cells/mm3, p=0.005) or AZT (mean 474, 95% CI-377 - 571 cells/mm3, p=0.004). Conclusion Mono and dual infections with HIV-1 and HCV is high among IHUs in Malindi, but ART coverage is low. The co-infected IHUs have elevated risk of immunodeficiency due to significantly depressed CD4 T-cell numbers. Coinfection screening, treatment-as-prevention for both HIV and HCV and harm reduction should be scaled up to alleviate infection burden.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0132287;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0132287;;

Levonorgestrel subdermal implants are preferred contraceptives with an expected failure rate of <1% over 5 years. We assessed the effect of efavirenz- or nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) coadministration on levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics. Methods. This nonrandomized, parallel group, pharmacokinetic evaluation was conducted in three groups of human immunodeficiency virus-infected Ugandan women: ART-naive (n = 17), efavirenz-based ART (n = 20), and nevirapine-based ART (n = 20). Levonorgestrel implants were inserted at baseline in all women. Blood was collected at 1, 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was week 24 levonorgestrel concentrations, compared between the ART-naive group and each ART group by geometric mean ratio (GMR) with 90% confidence interval (CI). Secondary endpoints included week 48 levonorgestrel concentrations and unintended pregnancies. Results. Week 24 geometric mean levonorgestrel concentrations were 528, 280, and 710 pg/mL in the ART-naive, efavirenz, and nevirapine groups, respectively (efavirenz: ART-naive GMR, 0.53; 90% CI,. 50,. 55 and nevirapine: ART-naive GMR, 1.35; 90% CI, 1.29, 1.43). Week 48 levonorgestrel concentrations were 580, 247, and 664 pg/mL in the ART-naive, efavirenz, and nevirapine groups, respectively (efavirenz: ART-naive GMR, 0.43; 90% CI,. 42,. 44 and nevirapine: ART-naive GMR, 1.14; 90% CI, 1.14, 1.16). Three pregnancies (3/20, 15%) occurred in the efavirenz group between weeks 36 and 48. No pregnancies occurred in the ART-naive or nevirapine groups. Conclusions. Within 1 year of combined use, levonorgestrel exposure was markedly reduced in participants who received efavirenz-based ART, accompanied by contraceptive failures. In contrast, nevirapine-based ART did not adversely affect levonorgestrel exposure or efficacy.";https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/cid/civ1001;14.0;13.8;12.5;10584838;;;

Methods: We implemented a WHO HIVDR prospective survey protocol at three treatment centers between 2012 and 2013. Data were abstracted from patient records at ART start (T1) and after 12 months (T2). Genotyping was performed in the HIV pol region at the two time points. Results: Of the 425 patients enrolled, at T2, 20 (4.7%) had died, 66 (15.5%) were lost to follow-up, 313 (73.6%) were still on first-line, 8 (1.9%) had switched to second-line, 17 (4.0%) had transferred out and 1 (0.2%) had stopped treatment. At T2, 272 out of 321 on first and second line (84.7%) suppressed below 1000 copies/ml and the HIV DR prevention rate was 70.1%, just within the WHO threshold of 70%. The proportion of participants with potential HIVDR was 20.9%, which is higher than the 18.8% based on pooled analyses from African studies. Of the 35 patients with mutations at T2, 80% had M184V/I, 65.7% Y181C, and 48.6% (54.8% excluding those not on Tenofovir) had K65R mutations. 22.9% had Thymidine Analogue Mutations (TAMs). Factors significantly associated with HIVDR prevention at T2 were: baseline viral load (VL) <100,000 copies/ml [Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.13, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.36-7.19] and facility. Independent baseline predictors for HIVDR mutations at T2 were: CD4 count <250 cells/l (AOR 2.80, 95% CI: 1.08-7.29) and viral load 100,000 copies/ml (AOR 2.48, 95% CI: 1.00-6.14). Conclusion: Strengthening defaulter tracing, intensified follow-up for patients with low CD4 counts and/or high VL at ART initiation together with early treatment initiation above 250 CD4 cells/ul and adequate patient counselling would improve ART efficacy and HIVDR prevention. The high rate of K65R and TAMs could compromise second line regimens including NRTIs.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0145536;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0145536;;

This 96-week follow-up of the trial assesses the durability of efficacy and safety of this treatment over 96 weeks. Methods: ENCORE1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial done at 38 clinical sites in 13 countries. HIV-infected adult patients (16 years of age) with no previous antiretroviral therapy, a CD4 cell count of 50-500 cells per L, and plasma HIV-1 viral load of at least 1000 copies per mL were randomly assigned (1:1) by an electronic case report form to receive fixed-dose daily tenofovir 300 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg plus efavirenz either 400 mg daily or 600 mg daily. Participants, physicians, and all other trial staff were masked to treatment assignment. Randomisation was stratified by HIV-1 viral load at baseline ( or >100 000 copies per mL). The primary endpoint was the difference in the proportions of patients in the two treatment groups with a plasma HIV-1 viral load below 200 copies per mL at week 96. Treatment groups were deemed to be non-inferior if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in viral load was above -10% by modified intention-to-treat analysis. Non-inferiority was assessed in the modified intention-to-treat, per-protocol, and non-completer=failure (NC=F) populations. Adverse events and serious adverse events were summarised by treatment group. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01011413. Findings: Between Aug 24, 2011, and March 19, 2012, 636 eligible participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to the two treatment groups (324 to efavirenz 400 mg and 312 to efavirenz 600 mg). The intention-to-treat population who received at least one dose of study drug comprised 630 patients: 321 in the efavirenz 400 mg group and 309 in the efavirenz 600 mg group. 585 patients (93%; 299 in the efavirenz 400 mg group and 286 in the 600 mg group) completed 96 weeks of follow-up. At 96 weeks, 289 (90·0%) of 321 patients in the efavirenz 400 mg group and 280 (90·6%) of 309 in the efavirenz 600 mg group had a plasma HIV-1 viral load less than 200 copies per mL (difference -0·6, 95% CI -5·2 to 4·0; p=0·72), which suggests continued non-inferiority of the lower efavirenz dose. Non-inferiority was recorded for thresholds of less than 50 and less than 400 copies per mL, irrespective of baseline plasma viral load. Adverse events were reported by 291 (91%) of 321 patients in the efavirenz 400 mg group and by 285 (92%) of 309 in the 600 mg group (p=0·48). The proportions of patients reporting an adverse event that was definitely or probably related to efavirenz were 126 (39%) for efavirenz 400 mg and 148 (48%) for efavirenz 600 mg (p=0·03). The number of patients who reported serious adverse events did not differ between the groups (p=0·20). Interpretation: Our findings confirm that efavirenz 400 mg is non-inferior to the standard dose of 600 mg in combination with tenofovir and emtricitabine as initial HIV therapy over 96 weeks. Fewer efavirenz-related adverse events were reported with the 400 mg efavirenz dose than with the 600 mg dose. These findings support the routine use of efavirenz 400 mg. The coadministration of rifampicin and efavirenz 400 mg needs further investigation.

To these ends, we implemented the following interventions in 5 districts: 1) health worker training and mentorship; 2) couples' HTC and male partner involvement; 3) women's psychosocial support groups; and 4) health and laboratory system strengthening for EID. Methods: We conducted a serial cross-sectional study using facility-level quarterly (Q) program data and individual-level infant HIV-1 DNA PCR data to evaluate STF performance on PMTCT indicators for project years (Y) 1 (April-December 2011) through 3 (January-December 2013), and compared these results to national averages. Results: Facility-level uptake of HTC, ART, infant nevirapine prophylaxis, and infant DNA PCR testing increased significantly from quarterly baselines of 66 % (n/N = 32,433/48,804), 23 % (n/N = 442/1,958), 1 % (n/N = 10/1,958), and 52 % (n/N = 1,385/2,644) to 87 % (n/N = 39,458/45,324), 96 % (n/N = 2,046/2,121), 100 % (n/N = 2,121/2,121), and 62 % (n/N = 1,462/2,340), respectively, by project end (all p < 0.001). Quarterly HTC, ART, and infant nevirapine prophylaxis uptake outperformed national averages over years 2-3. While transitioning EID laboratory services to MoH, STF provided first-time HIV-1 DNA PCR testing for 2,226 of 11,261 HIV-exposed infants (20 %) tested in the MoH EID program in STF districts from program inception (Y2) through Y3. Of these, 78 (3.5 %) tested HIV-positive. Among infants with complete documentation (n = 608), median age at first testing decreased from 112 days (interquartile range, IQR: 57-198) in Y2 to 76 days (IQR: 46-152) in Y3 (p < 0.001). During Y3 (only year with national data for comparison), non-significantly fewer exposed infants tested HIV-positive (3.6 %) at first testing in STF districts than nationally (4.1 %) (p = 0.4). Conclusions: STF interventions, integrated within the MoH Option B+ program, achieved favorable HTC, maternal ART, infant prophylaxis, and EID services uptake, and a low proportion of infants found HIV-infected at first DNA PCR testing.

Previous studies from certain developed countries have shown that, in ART-3TC, 3TC-resistant HBV progressively emerges at an annual rate of 15-20% in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV. This scenario in China warrants investigation because >10% of all HIV-infected patients in China are HBV carriers. We measured the occurrence of 3TC-resistant HBV during ART- 3TC for HIV-HBV coinfection and also tested the effect of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) used as an additional RTI (ART-3TC/TDF) in a cohort study in China. We obtained 200 plasma samples collected from 50 Chinese patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV (positive for hepatitis B surface antigen) and examined them for the prevalence of 3TCresistant HBV by directly sequencing PCR products that covered the HBV reverse-transcriptase gene. We divided the patients into ART-3TC and ART-3TC/TDF groups and compared the efficacy of treatment and incidence of drug-resistance mutation between the groups. HIV RNA and HBV DNA loads drastically decreased in both ART-3TC and ART- 3TC/TDF groups. In the ART-3TC group, HBV breakthrough or insufficient suppression of HBV DNA loads was observed in 20% (10/50) of the patients after 96-week treatment, and 8 of these patients harbored 3TC-resistant mutants. By contrast, neither HBV breakthrough nor treatment failure was recorded in the ART-3TC/TDF group. All of the 3TC-resistant HBV mutants emerged from the cases in which HBV DNA loads were high at baseline. Our results clearly demonstrated that ART-3TC is associated with the emergence of 3TC-resistant HBV in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and that ART-3TC/TDF reduces HBV DNA loads to an undetectable level. These findings support the use of TDFbased treatment regimens for patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV. Copyright:;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0134539;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0134539;;

We, therefore, explored PI resistance mutations and their association with viral load and CD4+ T cell counts in HIV-1 infected IDUs (ART-naive, n = 32; and -experienced, n = 47) and non-drug users (ART-naive, n = 21; and -experienced, n = 32) naive for PI treatment from coastal Kenya. Results: Only IDUs harboured major PI resistance mutations consisting of L90M, M46I and D30 N among 3 (6.4 %) ART-experienced and 1 (3.1 %) -naive individuals. Minor PI mutations including A71T, G48E, G48R, I13V, K20I, K20R, L10I, L10V, L33F, L63P, T74S, V11I, and V32L were detected among the ART-experienced (36.2 vs. 46.9 %) and -naive (43.8 vs. 66.7 %) IDUs and non-drug users, respectively. All the four IDUs possessing major mutations had high viral load while three presented with CD4+ T cell counts of <500 cells/ml. Among the ART-naive non-drug users, CD4+ T cell counts were significantly lower in carriers of minor mutations compared to non-carriers (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Transmitted drug resistance may occur in IDUs underscoring the need for genotyping resistance before initiating PI treatment.";http://www.aidsrestherapy.com/content/12/1/27;3.2;3.8;4.4;;27;;

Design: Post-hoc, combined analysis of two open-label, prospective, randomized clinical trials comparing first-line ART with efavirenz (EFV) vs. ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r)-based regimens in ART-naive, HIV-1-infected patients, with CD4 T-cell counts less than 100 cells/ml and wild-type HIV-1 by bulk sequencing. Methods: Pre-ART samples were reanalyzed for the presence of DRMVs and X4 HIV-1 using 454 sequencing. KaplanMeier curves and Cox regression were used to evaluate the association between X4 HIV and DRMVs and risk of virological failure. Results: From 141 evaluable patients, 57 received EFV, and 84 received PI/r, including first-line ART. Median pre-ART CD4 T-cell counts and HIV-1 RNA levels were 39 cells/ ml and 257 424 copies/ml, respectively; 35.5% of patients had X4 HIV variants. Detection of DRMVs leading to an ART-specific cumulative HIVdb score of at least 10 increased the risk of virological failure in patients initiating EFV [log-rank P0.048, hazard ratio4.3 (95% confidence interval: 0.8, 25.0), P0.074], but not in those starting PI/r. Presence of X4 HIV did not affect virological outcomes, but was associated with impaired CD4 T-cell count recovery over 2 years (214 vs. 315 cells/ml with X4 vs. R5 HIV-1 tropism, respectively, P0.017). Conclusion: Accounting for preexisting DRMVs may improve the outcomes of first-line nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART in late presenters with advanced immune suppression.

We studied the long-term consequences of virological failure in rural Tanzania. Previously, virological efficacy was measured in a cohort treated with ART. In the present study, patients with virological failure (VF; HIV-RNA >400 copies/ml) were followed up and compared to those with virological response (VR; HIV-RNA <400 copies/ml) with regard to mortality, CD4 change and subsequent virological outcome. Fifty-six patients with VF had a median CD4 count of 358 cells/µl (interquartile range [IQR] 223–635) and a median HIV-RNA of 13,573 copies/ml (IQR 2326-129,736). Median CD4 count for those with VR was 499 cells/µl (IQR 290-636). During a median follow-up time of 39 months (IQR 18-42), 8 of 56 patients (14.3%) with VF died, compared to 1 of 63 patients (1.6%) with VR (p=0.009). All registered deaths were HIV-related. Of 55 patients with subsequent HIV-RNA measurements, only 12 of 30 (40%) patients with VF achieved virological suppression, compared to 20 of 25 (80%) patients with VR (p=0.003).

Methods: Making a retrospective observational research on treatment naïve patients with HIV infection who initiated cART during the period of September 1st 2005-December 1st 2013. The demographic and clinical data were collected from the first visit to the time of the first regimen modification or the last visit in December 1st, 2014. The reasons of treatment modification were recorded. Survival analysis of modification was made by Kaplan-Meier curves analysis and log rank test, and a Cox multiple regression model was constructed to identify related factors of modification. Results: A total number of the eligible participants were 3372 and 871(25.8%) patients changed their first cART regimen. The median follow up was 22months [interquartile range (IQR) 14-39]. Among patients who modified the original regimen, drug toxicity occurred in 805(92.4%) participants and 44(5.1%) experienced treatment failure. In multiple regression analysis regimen modification was associated with patients' agemore than 40 years old (aHR1.224, 95% CI 1.051-1.426, P = 0.010), CD4 less than 200(aHR 1.218, 95% CI 1.044-1.421, P = 0.012) and the initial regimen they received. Compared with the regimen of TDF+3TC+EFV, patients with regimen of d4T+3TC+NVP, d4T+3TC+EFV, AZT+3TC+NVP or AZT+3TC+EFV were 10.4, 8.2, 6.4, 2.5 timesmore likely tomodify their initial regimen, respectively. Conclusions: The main reason for the regimen switch was drug toxicity and main risk factors for regimen modification were age older than 40 years, CD4 cell counts less than 200 at baseline and regimen they received. Among the 2NRTI plus 1NNRTI regimens, the co-formulation of d4T +3TC+NVP had the highest risk for modification while the regimen of TDF+3TC+EFV was the most tolerable treatment regimen in first years' follow up.

Methods: We developed TILDA (Tat/. rev Induced Limiting Dilution Assay) to measure the frequency of cells with inducible multiply-spliced HIV RNA, as these transcripts are usually absent in latently infected cells but induced upon viral reactivation. TILDA requires less than a million cells, does not require RNA extraction and can be completed in two days. Findings: In suppressed individuals on ART, we found the median frequency of latently infected CD4. + T cells as estimated by TILDA to be 24. cells/million, which was 48 times more than the frequency measured by the quantitative viral outgrowth assay, and 6-27 times less than the frequencies of cells harbouring viral DNA measured by PCR-based assays. TILDA measurements strongly correlated with most HIV DNA assays. The size of the latent reservoir measured by TILDA was lower in subjects who initiated ART during the early compared to late stage of infection (p. = 0.011). In untreated HIV disease, the frequency of CD4. + cells carrying latent but inducible HIV largely exceeded the frequency of actively producing cells, demonstrating that the majority of infected cells are transcriptionally silent even in the absence of ART. Interpretations: Our results suggest that TILDA is a reproducible and sensitive approach to measure the frequency of productively and latently infected cells in clinical settings. We demonstrate that the latent reservoir represents a substantial fraction of all infected cells prior to ART initiation. Research in context: In this manuscript, we describe the development of a novel assay that measures the magnitude of the latent HIV reservoir, the main barrier to HIV eradication. This novel assay, termed TILDA for Tat/rev Induced Limiting Dilution Assay, requires only 10. ml of blood, does not necessitate extraction of viral nucleic acids, is highly reproducible, covers a wide dynamic range of reservoir sizes and can be completed in two days. As such, TILDA may represent an alternative to existing assays used to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing the size of the latent HIV reservoir.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352396415300487;6.0;8.4;8.7;;;;

The aim of our study was to assess monitoring of first-line ART and switching to second-line ART in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods We did a collaborative analysis of cohort studies from 16 countries in east Africa, southern Africa, and west Africa that participate in the international epidemiological database to evaluate AIDS (IeDEA). We included adults infected with HIV-1 who started combination ART between January, 2004, and January, 2013. We defined switching of ART as a change from a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen to one including a protease inhibitor, with adjustment of one or more nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Virological and immunological failures were defined according to WHO criteria. We calculated cumulative probabilities of switching and hazard ratios with 95% CIs comparing routine viral load monitoring, targeted viral load monitoring, CD4 monitoring, and clinical monitoring, adjusting for programme and individual characteristics. Findings Of 297 825 eligible patients, 10 352 (3%) switched to second-line ART during 782 412 person-years of follow-up. Compared with CD4 monitoring, hazard ratios for switching were 3.15 (95% CI 2.92-3.40) for routine viral load monitoring, 1.21 (1.13-1.30) for targeted viral load monitoring, and 0.49 (0.43-0.56) for clinical monitoring. Of 6450 patients with confirmed virological failure, 58.0% (95% CI 56.5-59.6) switched by 2 years, and of 15 892 patients with confirmed immunological failure, 19.3% (18.5-20.0) switched by 2 years. Of 10 352 patients who switched, evidence of treatment failure based on one CD4 count or viral load measurement ranged from 86 (32%) of 268 patients with clinical monitoring to 3754 (84%) of 4452 with targeted viral load monitoring. Median CD4 counts at switching were 215 cells per L (IQR 117-335) with routine viral load monitoring, but were lower with other types of monitoring (range 114-133 cells per L). Interpretation Overall, few patients switched to second-line ART and switching happened late in the absence of routine viral load monitoring. Switching was more common and happened earlier after initiation of ART with targeted or routine viral load testing.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352301815000879;14.3;17.7;19.0;;;;

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.Background.Sensitive assays are needed for detection of residual human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in patients with undetectable plasma viral loads to determine whether eradication strategies are effective. The gold standard quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) underestimates the magnitude of the viral reservoir. We sought to determine whether xenograft of leukocytes from HIV type 1 (HIV)-infected patients with undetectable plasma viral loads into immunocompromised mice would result in viral amplification. Methods.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells or purified CD4+ T cells from HIV or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected subjects with undetectable plasma viral loads were adoptively transferred into NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice. The mice were monitored for viremia following depletion of human CD8+ T cells to minimize antiviral activity. In some cases, humanized mice were also treated with activating anti-CD3 antibody. Results.With this murine viral outgrowth assay (MVOA), we successfully amplified replication-competent HIV or SIV from all subjects tested, including 5 HIV-positive patients receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 6 elite controllers or suppressors who were maintaining undetectable viral loads without ART, including an elite suppressor from whom we were unable to recover virus by QVOA. Conclusions.Our results suggest that the MVOA has the potential to serve as a powerful tool to identify residual HIV in patients with undetectable viral loads.;https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiv230;10.4;9.2;9.0;00221899;;;

Methods Searches of MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 1964 to February 2015 were conducted using the search terms cobicistat and GS-9350. Relevant information was extracted from the identified clinical trials and review articles. Abstracts from the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (2014-2015) and the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (2013-2014) were also searched. Findings Cobicistat is a PK enhancer lacking antiviral activity that, via selective cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A inhibition, inhibits the metabolism of certain antiretroviral medications and is used for prolonging their effect. Cobicistat has been studied as a booster of elvitegravir, a second-generation integrase inhibitor, and of the protease inhibitors atazanavir and darunavir. Data on its clinical efficacy and tolerability have been presented in 2 Phase II trials and in 9 Phase III trials, which reported durable efficacy in terms of achievement of sustained suppression of HIV-1 RNA levels to <50 copies/mL for at least 48 weeks. Cobicistat was generally well-tolerated in these studies. Cobicistat may increase serum creatinine levels via the inhibition of proximal renal tubular cell transporters and thus reduce estimated glomerular filtration rate, although it does not appear to affect actual glomerular filtration rate. Given the potent CYP3A inhibition by cobicistat, its coadministration with drugs metabolized by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of such agents. Moreover, as cobicistat is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A, plasma concentrations may increase or decrease on coadministration with CYP3A inhibitors or inducers, respectively. Implications With potent durability through 48 weeks, a tolerability profile comparable to other first- and second-line antiretroviral therapies, and a convenient dosing schedule with low daily pill burden in fixed-dose combination tablets, cobicistat is a potential addition to the management of HIV infection as a PK enhancer. However, the effects of cobicistat on serum creatinine and its considerable drug-interaction potential may warrant additional monitoring.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0149291815009716;5.6;5.9;5.4;01492918;2650;;

But the prevalence of milder forms of HAND still remains high. Data from systematically conducted studies on the effects of ART on cognition are scanty in India, where HIV-1 clade C is prevalent. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-seropositive (HIV+) individuals (n = 92) with CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. The overall and domain-specific levels of cognitive functioning were determined using a locally recruited normative sample, and a change in neurocognitive functioning at the 1-year follow-up visit was analyzed. Results revealed cognitive impairment in 44.6 % of the HIV+ group at baseline. At the 1-year follow-up, the group showed significant improvement in the Learning domain (p < 0.05). HIV+ individuals showing improvement in the global cognitive scores had a significantly lower baseline CD4 cell count compared to others. Overall, the degree of improvement associated with the magnitude of rise in CD4 suggests the possibility that early, mild subclinical deficits may also benefit from treatment.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13365-015-0329-z;5.0;4.6;4.7;13550284;;;

This study reports the incidence and pattern of acquired antiretroviral drug resistance mutations and long-term outcomes of ART in a prospective cohort from Northwest Ethiopia. Two hundred and twenty HIV-1C infected treatment naïve patients were enrolled and 127 were followed-up for up to 38 months on ART. ART initiation and patients' monitoring was based on the WHO clinical and immunological parameters. HIV viral RNA measurement and drug resistance genotyping were done at baseline (N = 160) and after a median time of 30 (IQR, 27-38) months on ART (N = 127). Viral suppression rate (HIV RNA levels  400 copies/ml) after a median time of 30 months on ART was found to be 88.2% (112/127), which is in the range for HIV drug resistance prevention suggested by WHO. Of those 15 patients with viral load >400 copies/ml, six harboured one or more drug resistant associated mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) region. Observed NRTIs resistance associated mutations were the lamivudine-induced mutation M184V (n = 4) and tenofovir associated mutation K65R (n = 1). The NNRTIs resistance associated mutations were K103N (n = 2), V106M, Y181S, Y188L, V90I, K101E and G190A(n = 1 each). Thymidine analogue mutations and major drug resistance mutations in the protease (PR) region were not detected. Most of the patients (13/15) with virologic failure and accumulated drug resistance mutations had not met the WHO clinical and/or immunological failure criteria and continued the failing regimen. The incidence and pattern of acquired antiretroviral drug resistance mutations is lower and less complex than previous reports from sub Saharan Africa countries. Nevertheless, the data suggest the need for virological monitoring and resistance testing for early detection of failure. Moreover, adherence reinforcement will contribute to improving overall treatment outcomes.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0141318;5.7;5.4;5.2;;0141318;;

We conducted a trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design to assess the benefits of early antiretroviral therapy (ART), 6-month isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), or both among HIV-infected adults with high CD4+ cell counts in Ivory Coast. Methods We included participants who had HIV type 1 infection and a CD4+ count of less than 800 cells per cubic millimeter and who met no criteria for starting ART according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: deferred ART (ART initiation according to WHO criteria), deferred ART plus IPT, early ART (immediate ART initiation), or early ART plus IPT. The primary end point was a composite of diseases included in the case definition of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), non.AIDS-defining cancer, non.AIDS-defining invasive bacterial disease, or death from any cause at 30 months. We used Cox proportional models to compare outcomes between the deferred-ART and early-ART strategies and between the IPT and no-IPT strategies. Results A total of 2056 patients (41% with a baseline CD4+ count of.500 cells per cubic millimeter) were followed for 4757 patient-years. A total of 204 primary end-point events were observed (3.8 events per 100 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3 to 4.4), including 68 in patients with a baseline CD4+ count of at least 500 cells per cubic millimeter (3.2 events per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 2.4 to 4.0). Tuberculosis and invasive bacterial diseases accounted for 42% and 27% of primary end-point events, respectively. The risk of death or severe HIV-related illness was lower with early ART than with deferred ART (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.76; adjusted hazard ratio among patients with a baseline CD4+ count of.500 cells per cubic millimeter, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.94) and lower with IPT than with no IPT (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.88; adjusted hazard ratio among patients with a baseline CD4+ count of.500 cells per cubic millimeter, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.01). The 30-month probability of grade 3 or 4 adverse events did not differ significantly among the strategies. Conclusions In this African country, immediate ART and 6 months of IPT independently led to lower rates of severe illness than did deferred ART and no IPT, both overall and among patients with CD4+ counts of at least 500 cells per cubic millimeter.";http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1507198;67.2;73.1;66.1;00284793;;;

METHODS We conducted a multicenter, single-group, open-label study involving patients coinfected with HIV-1 and genotype 1 or 4 HCV receiving an antiretroviral regimen of tenofovir and emtricitabine with efavirenz, rilpivirine, or raltegravir. All patients received ledipasvir, an NS5A inhibitor, and sofosbuvir, a nucleotide polymerase inhibitor, as a single fixed-dose combination for 12 weeks. The primary end point was a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after the end of therapy. RESULTS Of the 335 patients enrolled, 34% were black, 55% had been previously treated for HCV, and 20% had cirrhosis. Overall, 322 patients (96%) had a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after the end of therapy (95% confidence interval [CI], 93 to 98), including rates of 96% (95% CI, 93 to 98) in patients with HCV genotype 1a, 96% (95% CI, 89 to 99) in those with HCV genotype 1b, and 100% (95% CI, 63 to 100) in those with HCV genotype 4. Rates of sustained virologic response were similar regardless of previous treatment or the presence of cirrhosis. Of the 13 patients who did not have a sustained virologic response, 10 had a relapse after the end of treatment. No patient had confirmed HIV-1 virologic rebound. The most common adverse events were headache (25%), fatigue (21%), and diarrhea (11%). No patient discontinued treatment because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks provided high rates of sustained virologic response in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HCV genotype 1 or 4.;http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1501315;67.2;73.1;66.1;00284793;;;

In preliminary studies conducted in Ethiopia and South Africa, we observed loss of cysteine cathepsin activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-positive patients on ART. We optimized a rapid protocol for multiplex cathepsin zymography to quantify cysteine cathepsins, and prospectively enrolled 350 HIV-positive, ART-naïve adults attending the Themba Lethu Clinic, Johannesburg, South Africa, to test if suppressed cathepsin activity could be a biomarker of ART adherence (103 patients were included in final analysis). Poor adherence was defined as detectable viral load (>400 copies/ml) or simplified medication adherence questionnaire, 4–6 months after ART initiation. 86 % of patients with undetectable viral loads after 6 months were cathepsin negative, and cathepsin-positive patients were twice as likely to have detectable viral loads (RR 2.32 95 % CI 1.26–4.29). Together, this demonstrates proof of concept that multiplex cathepsin zymography may be an inexpensive, objective method to monitor patient adherence to ART. Low cost of this electrophoresis-based assay makes it a prime candidate for implementation in resource-limited settings.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12033-015-9903-0;3.6;3.3;3.1;10736085;;;

We compared first-line cART regimens, timing of initiation and treatment outcomes in a middle income setting (HIV Centre, Belgrade, Serbia - HCB) with a high-income country (Royal Free London Hospital, UK - RFH). Methods: All antiretroviral-naïve HIV-positive individuals from HCB and RFH starting cART between 2003 and 2012 were included. 12-month viral load and CD4 count responses were compared, considering the first available measurement 12-24 months post-cART. The percentage that had made an antiretroviral switch for any reason, or for toxicity and the percentage that had died by 36 months (the latest time at which sufficient numbers remained under follow-up) were investigated using standard survival methods. Results: 361/597 (61 %) of individuals initiating cART at HCB had a prior AIDS diagnosis, compared to 337/1763 (19 %) at RFH. Median pre-ART CD4 counts were 177 and 238 cells/mm3 respectively (p < 0.0001). The most frequently prescribed antiretrovirals were zidovudine with lamivudine (149; 25 %) and efavirenz [329, 55 %] at HCB and emtricitabine with tenofovir (899; 51 %) and efavirenz [681, 39 %] at RFH. At HCB, a median of 2 CD4 count measurements in the first year of cART were taken, compared to 5 at RFH (p < 0.0001). Median (IQR) CD4 cell increase after 12 months was +211 (+86, +359) and +212 (+105, +318) respectively. 287 (48 %) individuals from HCB and 1452 (82 %) from RFH had an available viral load measurement, of which 271 (94 %) and 1280 (88 %) were <400 copies/mL (p < 0.0001). After 36 months, comparable percentages had made at least one antiretroviral switch (77 % HCB vs. 78 % RFH; p = 0.23). However, switches for toxicity/patient choice were more common at RFH. After 12 and 36 months of cART 3 % and 8 % of individuals died at HCB, versus 2 % and 4 % at RFH (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: In middle-income countries, cART is usually started at an advanced stage of HIV disease, resulting in higher mortality rates than in high income countries, supporting improved testing campaigns for early detection of HIV infection and early introduction of newer cART regimens.";http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/16/106;4.5;4.3;4.1;;106;;

Methods: Patients who initiated first cART between January 2008 and October 2014 were included. Discontinuation was defined as stop of at least 1 drug of the regimen, regardless of the reason. All causes of discontinuation were evaluated and 3 main endpoints were considered: toxicity, intolerance, and simplification. Predictors of discontinuation were examined separately for all 3 endpoints. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used for the outcome discontinuation of 1 drug regardless of the reason. Cox regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with treatment discontinuation because of the 3 reasons considered. Results: A total of 4052 patients were included. Main reason for stopping at least 1 drug were simplification (29%), intolerance (21%), toxicity (19%), other causes (18%), failure (8%), planned discontinuation (4%), and nonadherence (2%). In a multivariable Cox model, predictors of discontinuation for simplification were heterosexual transmission (P = 0.007), being immigrant (P = 0.017), higher nadir lymphocyte T CD4+cell (P = 0.011), and higher lymphocyte T CD8+cell count (P = 0.025); for discontinuation due to intolerance: the use of statins (P = 0.029), higher blood glucose levels (P = 0.050). About toxicity: higher blood glucose levels (P = 0.010) and the use of zidovudine/lamivudine as backbone (P = 0.044).

Methods: Retrospectively, 588 HIV-infected, cART-naive adults (aged 15 years), initiated on first-line ART between 2009 and 2010 at the Jos University Teaching Hospital, were evaluated. Association between adherence to drug-refill visits, virologic (viral load > 1000 copies/mL), and immunologic failure was assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results: After a median of 12 months on cART, 16% (n = 94) and 10% (n = 59) of patients had virologic and immunologic failures, respectively. In the final multivariable model, suboptimal adherence to drug-refill visits was a significant predictor of both virologic (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.2-2.3) and immunologic (AOR 1.92; 95% CI:1.06-3.49) failures.

Methods: Retrospective hospital database assessment of virally suppressed patients in whom the treating physician had switched to 50 mgof dolutegravir once daily due to one or more of the following reasons: antiretroviral- related adverse effects; comorbidities; risk of interactions; or archived resistance. Patients had 24 weeks of follow-up. Population, virological and immunological responses and safety and tolerability are described. Results: Thirty-three (22 on PIs, of whom 18 had ritonavir-boosted PI monotherapy) patients were identified: median (IQR) age of 56 (50-62) years, 55% women, median (IQR) of 19 (17-23) years of known HIV infection, 39% prior AIDS events, median (IQR) of 8 (4-13) years with undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA and median (IQR) CD4 cell count of 596 (420-843) cells/mm3. Twenty-five (76%) patients had antiretroviral-related adverse effects, 32 (97%) patients had comorbidities, 28 (85%) patients had risk of interactions and 16 (48%) patients had archived resistance. One patient with suboptimal adherence had low-level virological failure through weeks 4-24. HIV RNA genotypic resistance tests detected no integrase mutations at weeks 4 and 24, but 118R was detected in 7% of the integrated HIV DNA at 24 weeks. Patients had significant median decreases in triglycerides (-117 mg/dL), total cholesterol (-36 mg/dL), the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio (-0.7) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (-0.05 mg/dL) (P0.007), although the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation also decreased (-7.1 mL/min) (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: These data suggest the efficacy of dolutegravir monotherapy as a maintenance strategy to be further confirmed in randomized clinical trials.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dkw078;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

We describe the rationale, study design, implementation, and enrollment of the initial group of participants in the MTN seroconverter cohort. Methods: Initiated in 2008, MTN-015 is an ongoing observational cohort study enrolling participants who acquire HIV-1 infection during effectiveness studies of candidate microbicides. Eligible participants from recently completed and ongoing MTN trials are enrolled after seroconversion and return for regular follow-up visits with clinical and behavioral data collection. Biologic samples including blood and genital fluids are stored for future testing. Results: MTN-015 was implemented initially at six African sites and enrolled 100/139 (72%) of eligible women who seroconverted in HIV Prevention Trials Network protocol 035 (HPTN 035, conducted by the MTN). The median time from seroconversion in HPTN 035 to enrollment in MTN-015 was 18 months. Retention was good with >70% of visits completed. Implementation challenges included regulatory reviews, translation, and testing of questionnaires, and site readiness. Conclusions: Enrollment of HIV-seroconverters into a longitudinal observational follow-up study is feasible and acceptable to participants. Data and samples collected in this protocol will be used to assess safety of investigational HIV microbicides and answer other important public health questions for HIV infected women.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15284336.2016.1212561;2.8;2.7;0;15284336;;;

This study examined two possible mechanisms: altered expression of membrane drug transporter protein (MTP) and acquisition of mutations in pro-viral DNA. Methods: Expression levels of MTP and pro-viral DNA resistance mutation analysis were performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) before, during, and after chemotherapy. Results: Twenty nine patients completed the three time point estimations. There were no significant variations before, during, and after chemotherapy in the expression of four MTPs: ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC2, and SLCO3A1 (OATP3A1). Pro-viral DNA sequencing revealed that only one patient developed a new nucleos/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated mutation (184V) during the course of the study, giving a mutation rate of 0.0027 per person per year. Conclusions: In conclusion, concomitant administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy and cART does not induce expression of MTP. Furthermore, no significant changes in viral resistance were observed pre- and post-chemotherapy, suggesting mutagenic cytotoxic chemotherapy seems not to induce mutations in HIV pro-viral DNA.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15284336.2016.1210719;2.8;2.7;0;15284336;;;

Thus, the continued search for new antiretroviral agents with unique and different mechanisms of HIV inhibition remains critical, and compounds that can reduce the level of virus production from cells already infected with HIV, as opposed to preventing de novo infection, would be of great benefit. A mercaptobenzamide (MDH-1-38) and its prodrug (NS1040) are being developed as potential therapeutic compounds targeting the zinc finger of HIV nucleocapsid. In the presence of esterase enzymes, NS1040 is designed to be converted to MDH-1-38 which has antiviral activity. While we presume that NS1040 is rapidly converted to MDH-1-38 in all experiments, the two compounds were tested side-by-side to determine whether the presence of a prodrug affects the antiviral activity or mechanism of action. The two compounds were evaluated against a panel of HIV-1 clinical isolates in human PBMCs and monocyte-macrophages and yielded EC50 values ranging from 0.7 to 13 M with no toxicity up to 100 M. MDH-1-38 and NS1040 remained equally active in human PBMCs in the presence of added serum proteins as well as against HIV-1 isolates resistant to reverse transcriptase, integrase or protease inhibitors. Cell-based and biochemical mechanism of antiviral action assays demonstrated MDH-1-38 and NS1040 were virucidal at concentrations of 15 and 50 M, respectively. Cell to cell transmission of HIV in multiple passages was significantly reduced in CEM-SS and human PBMCs by reducing progeny virus infectivity at compound concentrations greater than 2 M. The combination of either MDH-1-38 or NS1040 with other FDA-approved HIV drugs yielded additive to synergistic antiviral interactions with no evidence of antiviral antagonism or synergistic toxicity. Serial dose escalation was used in attempts to select for HIV strains resistant to MDH-1-38 and NS1040. Virus at several passages failed to replicate in cells treated at increased compound concentrations, which is consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of the virus inactivating compounds. Through 14 passages, resistance to the compounds has not been achieved. Most HIV inhibitors with mechanism of antiviral action targeting a viral protein would have selected for a drug resistant virus within 14 passages. These studies indicate that these NCp7-targeted compounds represent new potent anti-HIV drug candidates which could be effectively used in combination with all approved anti-HIV drugs.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166354216303175;7.4;7.3;7.4;01663542;;;

This strategy is commonly referred to as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Membrane-associated drug transporters expressed ubiquitously in mammalian systems play a crucial role in modulating ARV disposition during HIV-1 infection. Members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and solute carrier (SLC) transporter superfamilies have been shown to interact with ARVs, including those that are used as part of first-line treatment regimens. As a result, the functional expression of drug transporters can influence the distribution of ARVs at specific sites of infection. In addition, pathological factors related to HIV-1 infection and/or ARV therapy itself can alter transporter expression and activity, thus further contributing to changes in ARV disposition and the effectiveness of HAART. This review summarizes current knowledge on the role of drug transporters in regulating ARV transport in the context of HIV-1 infection.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169409X16301430;23.1;25.0;29.3;0169409X;;;

HIVDR testing prior to ART initiation is not routinely performed in resource-limited settings. We aimed to assess the prevalence of primary HIVDR by short reverse transcriptase (RT) genotypic resistance assay and evaluate of the impact of the mutations on the treatment outcomes. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted in treatment-naÃ¯ve HIV-infected patients. Fourteen major mutations of codon 99â€""191 on the RT gene were selected (K103N, V106A/M, V108I, Q151M, Y181C/I, M184V/I, Y188C/L/H, and G190S/A) at a cost of testing of 35 USD. The association between the presence of primary HIVDR and undetectable HIV RNA (<50 copies/mL) after 6 months of ART was determined. Results A total of 265 HIV-infected patients were included, with a median age of 35.2 (range, 16.8â€"" 75.2) years; 62.6% were males. The median (interquartile range) CD4 cell count at ART initiation was 216 (77â€""381) cells/mm3. The overall prevalence of primary HIVDR was 7.9%. The prevalence of each HIVDR mutation were K103N 6.0%, V106I 1.1%, V108I 0.4%, Y181C 2.3%, Y181I 0.7%, Y181V 0.4%, M184V 3.0%, M184I 1.5%, and G190A 2.3%. No associated factor of having primary HIVDR was determined. By multiple stepwise logistic regression, factors associated with undetectable HIV RNA after 6 months of ART were: having M184V/I (odds ratio [OR] 0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02â€""0.62, p = 0.013), condom use (OR 2.38; 95% CI 1.12â€""5.06, p = 0.024), and adherence per 5% increase (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.00â€""1.35, p = 0.044). Conclusions The prevalence of primary HIVDR is approximately 8%; it is associated with detectable HIV RNA at 6 months after ART initiation. Routine â€œshort RT genotypic resistance assay should be considered in resource-limited settings to maximize treatment outcome.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0147945;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0147945;;

All rights reserved.Objectives: Strategies to cure HIV-1 infection require the eradication of viral reservoirs. An innovative approach for boosting the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response is the transfer of T-cell receptors (TCRs). Previously, we have shown that electroporation of TCRencoding mRNA is able to reprogram CD8+ T cells derived from healthy donors. So far, it is unknown whether the transfer of HIV-1-specific TCRs is capable to reprogram CD8+ T cells of HIV-1-infected patients. To assess the efficiency of TCR-transfer by mRNA electroporation and the functionality of reprogramed T cells in HIV-1-infected patients, we performed an in-vitro analysis of TCR-transfer into T cells from HIV-1-infected patients in various stages of disease and from healthy controls. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 16 HIV-1-infected patients (nine HLA-A02-positive, seven HLA-A02-negative) and from five healthy controls were electroporated with mRNA-constructs encoding TCRs specific for the HLA-A02/HIV-1-gag p17 epitope SLYNTVATL (SL9). Functionality of the TCRs was measured by gIFNELISpot assays. Results: SL9/TCR transfection into peripheral blood mononuclear cells from both HLAA02-positive and HLA-A02-negative HIV-1-infected patients and from healthy blood donors reprogramed T cells for recognition of SL9-presenting HLA-A02-positive cells in gIFN-ELISpot assays. SL9/TCR-transfer into T cells from an immunodeficient AIDS patient could induce recognition of SL9-expressing target cells only after reversion of Tcell dysfunction by antiretroviral therapy. Conclusion: The transfer of HIV-1-p17-specific TCRs into T cells is functional both in HIV-1-infected patients as well as in healthy blood donors. TCR-transfer is a promising method to boost the immune system against HIV-1.;http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201609100-00003;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

Evidence suggests most patients who appear to be virologically failing do so not due to drug resistance but to poor adherence, which, if properly addressed, could allow continued use of less expensive first- and second-line regimens. Drug resistant mutations (DRMs) were characterized among patients virologically failing second-line ART in Rwanda. Methods: A total of 128 adult patients receiving second-line ART for at least 6 months were invited to participate; 74 agreed and had HIV-1 viral load (VL) measured. Resistance genotypes were conducted in patients with virological failure (VF; that is, VL 1,000 copies/ml). Results: In total, 35 patients met the criteria for VF. The median time on lopinavir/ritonavir-based second-line ART was 2.7 years. Of 30 successful resistance genotype analyses, 13 (43%) had 1 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutation, 18 (60%) had at least 1 non-NRTI mutation and 5 (17%) had at least 1 major protease inhibitor mutation. Eleven (37%) had virus without significant mutations that would be fully sensitive to first-line ART; 12 (40%) had DRM to first-line ART but sensitive to second-line ART. Only 7 patients (23%) demonstrated a DRM profile requiring third-line ART. Conclusions: Among 30 genotyped samples of patients with VF on second-line ART, more than one-third had no significant DRMs, implicating poor adherence as the primary cause of VF.

Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.The free antiretroviral therapy (ART) program in India has scaled up to register second largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS across the globe. To assess the effectiveness of current first-line regimen we estimated virological suppression on completion of 1 year of ART. The study describes the correlates of virological failure (VF) and multinucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) drug resistance mutations (DRMs). In this cross-sectional study conducted between June and August 2014, consecutive adults from 4 State sponsored ART clinics of western India were recruited for plasma viral load screening at 12±2 months of ART initiation. Individuals with plasma viral load >1000copies/mL were selected for HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) genotyping. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with VF and multi-NRTI resistance mutations. Criteria adopted for multi-NRTI resistance mutation were either presence of K65R or 3 or more thymidine analog mutations (TAMs) or presence of M184V along with 2 TAMs. Of the 844 study participants, virological suppression at 1 year was achieved in 87.7% of individuals. Factors significantly associated with VF (P<0.005) were 12 months CD4 count of 100cells/mL (adjusted OR-7.11), low reported adherence (adjusted OR-4.44), and those living without any partner (adjusted OR-1.98). In patients with VF, the prevalence of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) DRM (78.75%) were higher as compared to NRTI (58.75%). Multi-NRTI DRMs were present in 32.5% of sequences and were significantly associated with CD4 count of 100cells/mL at baseline (adjusted OR-13.00) and TDF-based failing regimen (adjusted OR-20.43). Additionally, low reported adherence was negatively associated with multi-NRTI resistance (adjusted OR-0.11, P=0.015). K65R mutation was significantly associated with tenofovir (TDF)-based failing regimen (P<0.001). The study supports early linkage of HIV-infected individuals to the program for ART initiation, adherence improvement, and introduction of viral load monitoring. With recent introduction of TDF-based regimen, the emergence of K65R needs to be monitored closely among HIV-1 subtype C-infected Indian population.;http://journals.lww.com/00005792-201609130-00062;2.1;2.7;2.7;00257974;e4886;;

Data in treatment-experienced patients are more limited. We wished to assess the efficacy and safety of a switch to RPV-based regimens in well-suppressed treatment-experienced patients. Methods: Between September 2012 and June 2013, all antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced HIV-1-infected patients with a plasma HIV RNA level <50 copies/ml, and switching to an RPV-based regimen, were analysed in this retrospective observational monocentric cohort study. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with virological success defined as a plasma HIV RNA level <50 copies/ml at 12 months using the FDA snapshot algorithm. Results: A total of 281 participants were studied and 97% received a combination of RPV/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine. At month 12, the rate of virological success was 59% and increased to 72% using available data beyond month 12. Sixteen (6%) patients experienced virological failure, which was associated with the presence of the M184V/I resistance mutation in prior genotypes (P=0.02) and the use of a non-NNRTI as third agent before the switch (P=0.03). RPV-based regimens were overall well tolerated and only 23 (8%) patients discontinued ART because of adverse events, mostly neuropsychiatric adverse events. Switching to RPV was associated with significant but modest improvement of the lipid profile. Conclusions: In patients fully suppressed on ART, a switch to an RPV-based regimen should only be considered in the absence of prior virological failure or resistance mutations to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and NNRTIs to avoid virological failures.;http://www.intmedpress.com/journals/avt/abstract.cfm?id=3010&pid=48;4.4;4.1;3.9;13596535;;;

Design: Prospective studies of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals in Europe and the United States included in the HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration. Methods: HIV-positive, antiretroviral therapy-naive, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-free individuals were followed from the time they started an atazanavir or efavirenz regimen. We estimated an analog of the ""intention-to-treat"" effect for efavirenz versus atazanavir regimens on clinical, immunologic, and virologic outcomes with adjustment via inverse probability weighting for time-varying covariates. Results: A total of 4301 individuals started an atazanavir regimen (83 deaths, 157 AIDS-defining illnesses or deaths) and 18,786 individuals started an efavirenz regimen (389 deaths, 825 AIDS-defining illnesses or deaths). During a median follow-up of 31 months, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 0.98 (0.77, 1.24) for death and 1.09 (0.91, 1.30) for AIDS-defining illness or death comparing efavirenz with atazanavir regimens. The 5-year survival difference was 0.1% (95% confidence interval: -0.7%, 0.8%) and the AIDS-free survival difference was -0.3% (-1.2%, 0.6%). After 12 months, the mean change in CD4 cell count was 20.8 (95% confidence interval: 13.9, 27.8) cells/mm3 lower and the risk of virologic failure was 20% (14%, 26%) lower in the efavirenz regimens. Conclusion: Our estimates are consistent with a smaller 12-month increase in CD4 cell count, and a smaller risk of virologic failure at 12 months for efavirenz compared with atazanavir regimens.

HIV viral load escape under antiretroviral drug therapy, to which the virus was thought to be genotypically susceptible, is commonly observed in patients with poor adherence. We observed early viral escapes in two-newly diagnosed patients, during antiretroviral treatment, with different sequences compared to their original viral resistance test and who reported excellent adherence to and tolerance of their therapy. HIV superinfection with a new viral strain was identified in a patient with multiple risk factors and co-infections with sexually transmitted infections. The second patient was a case of the emergence of primary resistant virus under drug pressure.

GT predictions were obtained from the Stanford HIV database. VP and PT were obtained from Janssen Diagnostics BVBA's vircoTypeTMHIV-1 and Antivirogram®, respectively. With PT assumed as the ""gold standard,"" the area under the curve (AUC) and the Bland-Altman plot were used to assess the level of agreement in resistance interpretations. A total of 80 CRF01_AE samples from Asia and 100 subtype B from Janssen Diagnostics BVBA's database were analysed. CRF01_AE showed discordances ranging from 3 to 27 samples for GT-PT and 1 to 20 samples for VP-PT. The GT-PT and VP-PT AUCs were 0.76-0.97 and 0.81-0.99, respectively. Subtype B showed 3-61 discordances for GT-PT and 2-75 discordances for VP-PT. The AUCs ranged from 0.55 to 0.95 for GT-PT and 0.55 to 0.97 for VP-PT. Didanosine had the highest proportion of discordances and/or AUC in all comparisons. The patient with the largest didanosine FC difference in each subtype harboured Q151M mutation. Overall, GT and VP predictions for CRF01_AE performed significantly better than subtype B for three NRTIs. Although discrepancies exist, GT and VP resistance interpretations in HIV-1 CRF01_AE strains were highly robust in comparison with the gold-standard PT. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/jmv.24320;3.8;3.9;4.0;01466615;;;

All rights reserved.Objectives: The objective of this study was to address the dynamics of archived resistant quasispecies in cell-associated HIV-1 DNA over time in heavily ART-experienced patients with currently suppressed plasma HIV-1 RNA. Methods: Longitudinal ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) analysis of reverse transcriptase, protease and V3 Env regions was performed on blood-cell-associated HIV-1 DNA samples. Drug-resistance-associated mutations (DRAMs) and tropism were interpreted using the ANRS and Geno2Pheno algorithms. We analysed frozen blood cells from patients enrolled in the INNOVE and ANRS 123 ETOILE studies who achieved sustained viral suppression after salvage optimized ART (SOT). Results: Samples were available at baseline and 6 and 12 months after SOT initiation in 10 patients. V3 loop sequences displayed wide intra-individual dynamics over time. Viral variants harbouring DRAMs exhibited three non-exclusive scenarios. First, when SOT exerted the same selective pressure as previous failing regimens, some viral quasispecies still harboured the same DRAMs at the same level as at the time of virological failure. Thus, as DRAMs were mostly associated with the same viral variant, variants with a complete resistance pattern remained archived. Second, some viral variants harbouring DRAMs were no longer detected over time when SOT consisted of new antiretroviral classes or had resistance profiles distinct from those of previous failing regimens. Third, variants with new DRAMs associated with SOT emerged in blood cells during follow-up despite sustained virological control. Conclusions: Using longitudinal UDS analysis and focusing on DRAMs and tropism as markers, we demonstrated that, despite sustained virological control, archived HIV-1 DNA quasispecies continued to evolve.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dkv395;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;dkv395;;

Methods: We performed a cross-sectional virological assessment of adults on second-line ART for 6 months between November 2006 and December 2011, followed by a prospective follow-up over 2 years of patients with virological failure (VF) at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Vietnam. VF was defined as HIV RNA concentrations 1000 copies/mL. Resistance mutations were identified by population sequencing of the pol gene and interpreted using the 2014 IAS-USA mutation list and the Stanford algorithm. Logistic regression modelling was performed to identify predictors of VF. Results: Two hundred and thirty-one patients were enrolled in the study. The median age was 32 years; 81.0% were male, 95.7% were on a lopinavir/ritonavir-containing regimen and 22 (9.5%) patients had VF. Of the patients with VF, 14 (64%) carried at least one major protease mutation [median: 2 (IQR: 1-3)]; 13 (59%) had multiple protease mutations conferring intermediate- to high-level resistance to lopinavir/ritonavir. Mutations conferring cross-resistance to etravirine, rilpivirine, tipranavir and darunavir were identified in 55%, 55%, 45% and 27% of patients, respectively. Higher viral load, adherence <95% and previous indinavir use were independent predictors of VF. The 2 year outcomes of the patients maintained on lopinavir/ritonavir included: death, 7 (35%); worsening virological/immunological control, 6 (30%); and virological re-suppression, 5 (25%). Two patients were switched to raltegravir and darunavir/ritonavir with good HIV control. Conclusions: High-prevalence PI resistance was associated with previous indinavir exposure.

This strain was detected in treatment-naive patients from southern Spain. Methods: The study was undertaken at the Virgen de la Victoria Hospital, Malaga, a reference centre for the study of HIV-1 genotype resistance in Andalusia (the 'Costa del Sol'), Spain. Genotypic resistance testing was done in an automated sequencer. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using a 630 bp region of the reverse transcriptase with the mutations mentioned. Results: Between 2007 and 2014, we detected the Malaga strain in 30 treatment-naive patients. All were MSM, seen at five hospitals on the Costa del Sol. In all cases, the HIV-1 was subtype B with viral tropism R5. Phylogenetic analysis based on the reverse transcriptase sequence showed consistent grouping (with a bootstrap value of the common node of 100%) of the isolates that shared the mutation pattern mentioned. This strain has not been detected elsewhere or in previously treated patients. All of the patients treated with first-line combination ART responded. Conclusions: We report a cluster of an HIV-1 strain with multiple resistance mutations that was transmitted over a period of >8 years, affecting 30 naive patients from the same geographical area.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 drug resistance mutations (DRMs) often accompany treatment failure. Although subtype differences are widely studied, DRM comparisons between subtypes either focus on specific geographic regions or include populations with heterogeneous treatments.Methods. We characterized DRM patterns following first-line failure and their impact on future treatment in a global, multi-subtype reverse-transcriptase sequence dataset. We developed a hierarchical modeling approach to address the high-dimensional challenge of modeling and comparing frequencies of multiple DRMs in varying first-line regimens, durations, and subtypes. Drug resistance mutation co-occurrence was characterized using a novel application of a statistical network model.Results. In 1425 sequences, 202 subtype B, 696 C, 44 G, 351 circulating recombinant forms (CRF)01_AE, 58 CRF02_AG, and 74 from other subtypes mutation frequencies were higher in subtypes C and CRF01_AE compared with B overall. Mutation frequency increased by 9%-20% at reverse transcriptase positions 41, 67, 70, 184, 215, and 219 in subtype C and CRF01_AE vs B. Subtype C and CRF01_AE exhibited higher predicted cross-resistance (+12%-18%) to future therapy options compared with subtype B. Topologies of subtype mutation networks were mostly similar.Conclusions.

However, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is associated with renal and bone toxic effects; the novel prodrug tenofovir alafenamide achieves 90% lower plasma tenofovir concentrations. We aimed to further assess safety and efficacy of fixed-dose combination emtricitabine with tenofovir alafenamide in patients switched from emtricitabine with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Methods In this controlled, double-blind, multicentre phase 3 study, we recruited virologically suppressed (HIV RNA <50 copies per mL) patients with HIV aged 18 years and older receiving regimens containing fixed-dose combination emtricitabine with tenofovir disoproxil fumartate from 78 sites in North America and Europe. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to switch to fixed-dose 200 mg emtricitabine with 10 mg or 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide or to continue 200 mg emtricitabine with 200 mg or 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, while remaining on the same third agent for 96 weeks. Randomisation was done by a computer-generated allocation sequence and was stratified by the third agent (boosted protease inhibitor vs other agent). Investigators, patients, and study staff giving treatment, assessing outcomes, and collecting data were masked to treatment group. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL at week 48 as defined by the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%. The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed with the per-protocol analysis set, whereas the safety analysis included all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02121795. Findings We recruited patients between May 6, 2011, and Sept 11, 2014; 780 were screened and 668 were randomly assigned to receive either tenofovir alafenamide (n=333) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n=330). Through week 48, virological success (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) was maintained in 314 (94%) of patients in the tenofovir alafenamide group compared with 307 (93%) in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (difference 1·3%, 95% CI 2·5 to 5·1), showing non-inferiority of tenofovir alafenamide to tenofovir disproxil fumarate. Seven patients in the tenofovir alafenamide (2%) and three (1%) in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group discontinued due to adverse events. There were no cases of proximal renal tubulopathy in either group. Interpretation In patients switching from emtricitabine with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to emtricitabine with tenofovir alafenamide, high rates of virological suppression were maintained. With its safety advantages, fixed-dose emtricitabine with tenofovir alafenamide has the potential to become an important NRTI backbone.

Studies in healthy volunteers have established bioequivalence between cobicistat and ritonavir as pharmacoenhancers of both atazanavir (ATV) and darunavir (DRV). In addition, two randomized clinical trials (one Phase II and one Phase III noninferiority trial with a 144-week follow-up period) demonstrated that cobicistat had sustainable and comparable efficacy and safety to ritonavir as a pharmacoenhancer of ATV through 144 weeks of treatment in HIV-1-infected patients. Furthermore, one Phase III, open-label, single-arm, clinical trial reflected virologic and immunologic responses and safety outcomes consistent with prior published data for DRV/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily, supporting the use of DRV/c 800/150 mg once daily for future treatment of treatment-naïve and -experienced HIV-1-infected patients with no DRV resistance-associated mutations. Low rates of virologic failure secondary to resistance to antiretroviral regimens were present in these clinical studies. Most notable adverse events in the ATV studies were hyperbilirubinemia and in the DRV study rash. Small increases in serum creatinine and minimally reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate Cockcroft–Gault calculation (eGFRCG) were observed in ATV/c and DRV/c clinical studies consistent with other studies evaluating elvitegravir/cobicistat/tenofovir/emtricitabine for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. These renal parameter changes occurred acutely in the first few weeks and plateaued off for the remaining study periods and are not necessarily clinically relevant. Cobicistat has numerous advantages compared to ritonavir such as fewer drug–drug interactions, being devoid of anti-HIV-1 activity, as well as it has better solubility affording coformulation with other antiretrovirals as simplified fixed-dose combinations. Overall, the recent approval of ATV/c and DRV/c offers HIV patients opportunities for improved adherence to lifelong treatment. Future studies are warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of ATV/c and DRV/c in treatment-experienced patients.;https://www.dovepress.com/evaluating-the-role-of-atazanavircobicistat-and-darunavircobicistat-fi-peer-reviewed-article-HIV;4.3;5.0;2.4;;;;

All rights reserved.High active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can reduce plasma viremia to levels below the limit of detection, leading to adequate immune recovery and clinical stability in most HIV-1-infected patients. However, the virus persists in reservoirs, and free virions can be found in the plasma. We report here the case of an HIV-infected patient diagnosed in 1999, who exhibited good adherence to medication and HAART efficacy after multiple protocol changes. In this study, we describe the clinical features, chronological changes in HIV viral load and CD4+ T-cell count, and treatment outcomes of multiple combinations of antiretrovirals (ARV).The patient presented cycles of viral load during treatment ranging from undetectable, low, and intermediate HIV-1 RNA levels, to levels above the limits of quantification. A therapeutic regimen intensified with raltegravir (RAL) promoted constant depletion of HIV viral load and an increase in CD4+ T-cells. The report shows that enhanced HAART efficacy using RAL can reduce HIV viral load.;http://www.ajol.info/index.php/tjpr/article/view/136381;1.0;0.8;0.9;15965996;;;

Numerous studies have shown that baseline drug resistance patterns may influence the outcome of antiretroviral therapy. Therefore, guidelines recommend drug resistance testing to guide the choice of initial regimen. In addition to optimizing individual patient management, these baseline resistance data enable transmitted drug resistance (TDR) to be surveyed for public health purposes. The SPREAD program systematically collects data to gain insight into TDR occurring in Europe since 2001. Methods. Demographic, clinical, and virological data from 4140 antiretroviral-naive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals from 26 countries who were newly diagnosed between 2008 and 2010 were analyzed. Evidence of TDR was defined using the WHO list for surveillance of drug resistance mutations. Prevalence of TDR was assessed over time by comparing the results to SPREAD data from 2002 to 2007. Baseline susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs was predicted using the Stanford HIVdb program version 7.0. Results. The overall prevalence of TDR did not change significantly over time and was 8.3% (95% confidence interval, 7.2%-9.5%) in 2008-2010. The most frequent indicators of TDR were nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutations (4.5%), followed by nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations (2.9%) and protease inhibitor mutations (2.0%). Baseline mutations were most predictive of reduced susceptibility to initial NNRTI-based regimens: 4.5% and 6.5% of patient isolates were predicted to have resistance to regimens containing efavirenz or rilpivirine, respectively, independent of current NRTI backbones. Conclusions. Although TDR was highest for NRTIs, the impact of baseline drug resistance patterns on susceptibility was largest for NNRTIs. The prevalence of TDR assessed by epidemiological surveys does not clearly indicate to what degree susceptibility to different drug classes is affected.;https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/cid/civ963;14.0;13.8;12.5;10584838;;;

We, therefore, evaluated the threshold of HIVDR in a population initiating ART, to inform on the effectiveness of first-line regimens, considering HIV-1 diversity, plasma viral load (PVL), and CD4-based disease progression. A total of 53 adults [median (interquartile range, IQR) CD4: 162 cell/mm3 (48-284); median (IQR) PVL: 5.34 log10 RNA (4.17-6.42) copies/ml] initiating ART in 2014 at the Yaoundé Central Hospital were enrolled for HIV-1 protease-reverse transcriptase sequencing. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were interpreted using the 2009 World Health Organization (WHO) list versus the Stanford HIVdb algorithm version 7.0. Level of DRMs was low (3.77%) versus moderate (7.55%), respectively, following the WHO list (T69D, K103N) versus Stanford HIVdb (T69D, A98G, K103N, K238T), respectively. Prevailing clade was CRF02-AG (71.70%). Based on Stanford HIVdb, a slightly higher proportion of patients with DRMs were found among ones infected with CRF02-AG than in those non-CRF02-AG infected (7.89% vs. 6.67%, p = 1.000), with lower PVL (7.69% <5.5 vs. 0% 5.5 log10 RNA copies/ml, p = .488) and with higher CD4 counts (9.52% CD4 200 vs. 3.33% CD4 <200 cells/mm3, p = .749). Thresholds of DRMs suggest that standard first-line regimens currently used in Cameroon may remain effective at population levels, despite scale-up of ART in the country, pending adherence, and closed virological monitoring. With an intent-to-diagnose approach, the discrepant levels of DRMs support using Stanford HIVdb to evaluate initial ART, while revising the WHO list for surveillance.";http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2015.0065;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

Nevertheless, the benefits of ART are only realized through adherence to lifelong treatment. Though contemporary antiretroviral (ARV) drugs have fewer adverse effects in comparison to older ARV drugs, many agents are associated with negative or unknown long-term effects. There is increasing evidence that two-drug (dual-therapy) regimens may be an effective alternative to the currently recommended three-drug (triple-therapy) regimens. In this review, we provide a comprehensive and critical review of recently completed and ongoing trials of dual-therapy regimens in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients. We also review current HIV/AIDS society recommendations regarding dual therapy as well as future therapeutic possibilities.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40265-016-0553-8;9.4;9.2;9.6;00126667;;;

Some data suggest that 3TC monotherapy-based cART may be effective in patients with low pretreatment HBV DNA. Methods: Prospective study of 151 Chinese HIV/HBV coinfected subjects of whom 60 received 3TC-based cART and 91 received TDF+3TC-based cART. Factors associated with HBV DNA suppression at 24 and 48 weeks, including anti-HBV drugs, baseline HBV DNA, and baseline CD4 cell count, were evaluated overall and stratified by baseline HBV DNA using Poisson regression with a robust error variance. Results: Baseline HBV DNA 20,000 IU/mL was present in 48.3% and 44.0% of subjects in the 3TC and TDF groups, respectively (P = 0.60). After 48 weeks of treatment, HBV DNA suppression rates were similar between these 2 groups (96.8% vs. 98.0% for 3TC and TDF+3TC, P > 0.999) in subjects with baseline HBV DNA <20,000 IU/mL; whereas in those with baseline HBV DNA 20,000 IU/mL, TDF+3TC was associated with higher suppression rates (34.5% vs. 72.5% in 3TC and TDF+3TC groups, respectively, P = 0.002). In stratified multivariate regression, TDF use (RR 1.98, P = 0.010) and baseline HBV DNA (per 1 log increase in International Units Per Milliliter, RR 0.74, P < 0.001) were associated with HBV DNA suppression only when baseline HBV DNA 20,000 IU/mL. Conclusion: This study suggests that 3TC monotherapy-based cART is efficacious for HBV treatment through 48 weeks in HIV/HBV coinfection when baseline HBV DNA<20,000 IU/mL.

Linkage between frequently emerging resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) was determined. DS (llIumina®) and population sequencing (PS) results were available at baseline for 47 VFs and time of failure for 48 VFs; and at baseline for 49 responders matched for baseline characteristics. Minority mutations were accurately detected at frequencies down to 1.2% of the HIV-1 quasispecies. No baseline minority rilpivirine RAMs were detected in VFs; one responder carried 1.9% F227C.

This.Introduction: Antiretroviral treatment (ART) has been scaled up over the last decade but compared to adults, children living with HIV are less likely to receive ART. Moreover, children and adolescents are more vulnerable than adults to virological failure (VF) and emergence of drug resistance. In this study we determined virological outcome in perinatally HIV-1-infected children and adolescents receiving ART in Togo. Methods: HIV viral load (VL) testing was consecutively proposed to all children and adolescents who were on ART for at least 12 months when attending HIV healthcare services for their routine follow-up visit (June to September 2014). Plasma HIV-1 VL was measured using the m2000 RealTime HIV-1 assay (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL, USA). Genotypic drug resistance was done for all samples with VL1000 copies/ml. Results and discussion: Among 283 perinatally HIV-1-infected children and adolescents included, 167 (59%) were adolescents and 116 (41%) were children. The median duration on ART was 48 months (interquartile range: 28 to 68 months). For 228 (80.6%), the current ART combination consisted of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (zidovudine and lamivudine) and one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) (nevirapine or efavirenz). Only 28 (9.9%) were on a protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen. VL was below the detection limit (i.e. 40 copies/ml) for 102 (36%), between 40 and 1000 copies/ml for 35 (12.4%) and above 1000 copies/ml for 146 (51.6%). Genotypic drug-resistance testing was successful for 125/146 (85.6%); 110/125 (88.0%) were resistant to both NRTIs and NNRTIs, 1/125 (0.8%) to NRTIs only, 4/125 (3.2%) to NNRTIs only and three harboured viruses resistant to reverse transcriptase and PIs. Overall, 86% (108/125) of children and adolescents experiencing VF and successfully genotyped, corresponding thus to at least 38% of the study population, had either no effective ART or had only a single effective drug in their current ART regimen. Conclusions: Our study provided important information on virological outcome on lifelong ART in perinatally HIV-1-infected children and adolescents who were still on ART and continued to attend antiretroviral (ARV) clinics for follow-up visits. Actual conditions for scaling up and monitoring lifelong ART in children in resource-limited countries can have dramatic long-term outcomes and illustrate that paediatric ART receives inadequate attention.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.7448/IAS.19.1.20683;5.5;6.7;7.1;;20683;;

All rights reserved.Background. Tenofovir is part of the preferred first-line regimen for HIV-infected patients in South Africa (SA), but is associated with kidney toxicity. SA antiretroviral therapy (ART) guidelines recommend creatinine monitoring at baseline (ART start) and at 3, 6 and 12 months, and substituting tenofovir with zidovudine, stavudine or abacavir should creatinine clearance (CrCl) decrease to <50 mL/min. Objective. To assess clinician compliance with tenofovir monitoring and prescribing guidelines. Methods. We described the proportion of adult patients on tenofovir-based first-line ART who were screened for baseline renal impairment, were monitored according to the SA antiretroviral treatment guidelines, and were switched from tenofovir if renal function declined. Results. We included 13 168 patients who started ART from 2010 to 2012. Creatinine concentrations were recorded in 11 712 (88.9%) patients on tenofovir at baseline, 9 135/11 657 (78.4%) at 3 months, 5 426/10 554 (51.4%) at 6 months, and 5 949/ 8 421 (70.6%) at 12 months. At baseline, 227 (1.9%) started tenofovir despite a CrCl <50 mL/min. While on tenofovir, 525 patients had at least one CrCl of <50 mL/min. Of 382 patients with 3 months’ follow-up after a CrCl <50 mL/min, 114 (29.8%) stopped tenofovir within 3 months. Clinicians were more likely to stop tenofovir in patients with lower CrCl and CD4 count. Of 226 patients who continued to receive tenofovir and had further CrCls available, 156 (69.0%) had a CrCl 50 mL/min at their next visit. Conclusions. Creatinine monitoring is feasible where access to laboratory services is good. Kidney function recovered in most patients who continued to receive tenofovir despite a CrCl <50 mL/min. Further research is needed to determine how best to monitor renal function with tenofovir in resource-limited settings.;http://www.samj.org.za/index.php/samj/article/view/10153;1.9;1.8;1.8;02569574;;;

Design: A nonrandomized, open-label, multicentre, phase-IV study. Methods: HIV-positive pregnant women receiving abacavir 600mg q.d. as part of clinical care were included. Intensive 24-h pharmacokinetic sampling was performed during the third trimester and at least 2 weeks after delivery. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis. Paired cord blood and maternal blood samples were taken at delivery when feasible. Results: A total of 14 women were included in the analysis. Geometric mean ratios (90% confidence intervals) of third trimester versus postpartum were 1.05 (0.92-1.19) for AUC 0-24h and 1.00 (0.83-1.21) for C max. The median (range) ratio of abacavir cord plasma to maternal plasma was 1.0 (0.7-1.0, n=3). Viral load at the third trimester visit was less than 50copies/ml in 13 participants (93%; one unknown). In total, 13 (93%; one unknown) children were tested HIV-negative. Conclusion: The pharmacokinetics of abacavir 600mg q.d. during pregnancy are equivalent to postpartum. No dose adjustments are required during pregnancy and similar antiviral activity is expected.";http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201605150-00009;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

During untreated disease, HIV replication is concentrated within T follicular helper cells (T FH ). Heightened permissiveness, the presence of highly infectious virions on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), low frequencies of virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in B cell follicles, expansions in T FH , and T FH dysfunction, all likely promote replication in T FH . Limited data suggest that memory T FH play a role in the latent or subclinical reservoir of HIV during antiretroviral therapy (ART), potentially for many of the same reasons. A better understanding of the role of memory T FH and FDC-bound virions in promoting recrudescent viremia in the setting of ART cessation is essential. Studies that target follicular virus reservoirs are needed to determine their role in HIV latency and to suggest successful cure strategies.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0966842X16000421;19.3;19.5;20.5;0966842X;;;

Darunavir (DRV) is a nonpeptidomimetic protease inhibitor approved for use with a ritonavir booster (DRV/r). This study evaluated the effectiveness of DRV/r in combination with other ARV agents in routine clinical practice in Italy. In this descriptive observational study, data on utilization of DRV/r, under the conditions described in the marketing authorization, were collected from June 2009 to December 2012. Effectiveness (VL <50 copies/mL), tolerability, and durability in four patient groups (two DRV/r-experienced, one ARV-experienced DRV/r-naïve, and one ARV-naïve) were analyzed. Secondary objectives included immunological response, safety, and persistence/discontinuation rates. In total, 875 of 883 enrolled patients were included in the analysis: of these, 662 (75.7%) completed the follow-up until the end of 2012 and 213 (24.3%) withdre from the study earlier. Initial DRV dose was 600 mg twice daily (67.1%) or 800 mg once daily (32.9%). Only 16 patients (1.8%) withdrew from the study due to virological failure. Virological response proportions were higher in patients virologically suppressed at study entry versus patients with baseline VL 50 copies/mL in each ARV-experienced group, while there was no consistent difference across study groups and baseline VL strata according to baseline CD4+ cell count. CD4+ cell count increased from study entry to last study visit in all the four groups. DRV/r was well tolerated, with few discontinuations due to study-emergent nonfatal adverse events (3.0% overall, including 2.1% drug-related) or deaths (3.0% overall, all non-drug-related); 35.3% of patients reported 1 adverse events. These observational data show that DRV/r was effective and well tolerated in the whole patient population described here. The DRV/r-containing regimen provided viral suppression in a high percentage of patients in all group, with low rates of discontinuation due to virological failure.";https://www.dovepress.com/effectiveness-durability-and-safety-of-darunavirritonavir-in-hiv-1-inf-peer-reviewed-article-DDDT;5.0;5.7;5.0;;;;

Open Access article distributed under the terms of CC BY.Background: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is crucial for controlling HIV-1 infection through wide-scale treatment as prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Potent tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing regimens are increasingly used to treat and prevent HIV, although few data exist for frequency and risk factors of acquired drug resistance in regions hardest hit by the HIV pandemic. We aimed to do a global assessment of drug resistance after virological failure with first-line tenofovir-containing ART. Methods: The TenoRes collaboration comprises adult HIV treatment cohorts and clinical trials of HIV drug resistance testing in Europe, Latin and North America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. We extracted and harmonised data for patients undergoing genotypic resistance testing after virological failure with a first-line regimen containing tenofovir plus a cytosine analogue (lamivudine or emtricitabine) plus a non-nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI; efavirenz or nevirapine). We used an individual participant-level meta-analysis and multiple logistic regression to identify covariates associated with drug resistance. Our primary outcome was tenofovir resistance, defined as presence of K65R/N or K70E/G/Q mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene. Findings: We included 1926 patients from 36 countries with treatment failure between 1998 and 2015. Prevalence of tenofovir resistance was highest in sub-Saharan Africa (370/654 [57%]). Pre-ART CD4 cell count was the covariate most strongly associated with the development of tenofovir resistance (odds ratio [OR] 1·50, 95% CI 1·27-1·77 for CD4 cell count <100 cells per L). Use of lamivudine versus emtricitabine increased the risk of tenofovir resistance across regions (OR 1·48, 95% CI 1·20-1·82). Of 700 individuals with tenofovir resistance, 578 (83%) had cytosine analogue resistance (M184V/I mutation), 543 (78%) had major NNRTI resistance, and 457 (65%) had both. The mean plasma viral load at virological failure was similar in individuals with and without tenofovir resistance (145 700 copies per mL [SE 12 480] versus 133 900 copies per mL [SE 16 650; p=0·626]). Interpretation: We recorded drug resistance in a high proportion of patients after virological failure on a tenofovir-containing first-line regimen across low-income and middle-income regions. Effective surveillance for transmission of drug resistance is crucial. Funding: The Wellcome Trust.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1473309915005368;31.6;31.9;32.4;14733099;;;

The SHCS is highly representative and includes 72% of patients receiving ART in Switzerland. Drug resistance was defined as the presence of 1 major mutation in a genotypic resistance test. To estimate the prevalence of drug resistance, data for patients with no resistance test was imputed based on the patient's risk of harboring drug-resistant viruses. Results. The emergence of new drug resistance mutations declined dramatically from 401 to 23 patients between 1999 and 2013. The upper estimated prevalence limit of drug resistance among ART-experienced patients decreased from 57.0% in 1999 to 37.1% in 2013. The prevalence of 3-class resistance decreased from 9.0% to 4.4% and was always <0.4% for patients who initiated ART after 2006. Most patients actively participating in the SHCS in 2013 with drug-resistant viruses initiated ART before 1999 (59.8%). Nevertheless, in 2013, 94.5% of patients who initiated ART before 1999 had good remaining treatment options based on Stanford algorithm. Conclusions. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 drug resistance among ART-experienced patients in Switzerland is a well-controlled relic from the era before combination ART. Emergence of drug resistance can be virtually stopped with new potent therapies and close monitoring.;https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/cid/ciw128;14.0;13.8;12.5;10584838;;;

However, the role of MDSCs in HIV/HCV coinfection is unclear. Here, we observed a dramatic increase in monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) level in the peripheral blood of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients compared to that of healthy controls; the level of M-MDSCs proportion in coinfection was not higher than that in HIV or HCV monoinfection. Interestingly, we found the M-MDSCs level in coinfected patients correlated well with CD4+ T cell loss (r = 0.5680; P = 0.0058), HIV-1 load (r = 0.6011; P = 0.0031), HCV load (r = 0.6288; P = 0.0017) and activated CD38+ T cells (r = 0.5139; P = 0.0144). Initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy considerably reduced both M-MDSCs and CD8+CD38+-activated T cell proportion in coinfected patients, and they showed a parallel course of decline. Thus, our results suggest that HIV-1 infection and high chronic immune activation may contribute to the expansion of M-MDSCs and accelerate the disease progression in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/sji.12429;4.0;4.3;4.4;03009475;;;

This study presents the features of non-B-infected patients enrolled in the cohort of antiretroviral treatment (ART) naïve HIV-infected patients included in the Research Network on HIV/AIDS (CoRIS). Methods The study includes a selected group of HIV-1 non-B-infected subjects from 670 subjects with pol sequences collected from 2004 to 2008 in the CoRIS cohort. Epidemiological-clinical-virological data were analyzed since cohort entry until October 2011, considering the presence or absence of treatment failure (TF). Results Eighty two non-B infected subjects with known HIV-1 variants were selected from 2004 to 2008 in the CoRIS cohort, being mainly female, immigrants, infected by recombinant viruses, and by heterosexual route. They had an intermediate TDR rate (9.4%), a high rate of TF (25.6%), of losses to follow-up (35%), of coinfections (32.9%), and baseline CD4+ counts 350 cells/mm3 (61.8%). Non-B subjects with TF showed higher rates of heterosexual infection (85.7% vs. 69.5%, p < 0.05), tuberculosis (30.8% vs. 9.1%, p = 0.10) and hepatitis C (23.8% vs. 13.9%, p = 0.34) coinfections and lower rates of syphilis (0% vs. 21.9%, p < 0.05), and had more frequently received first-line ART including protease inhibitors (PIs) than patients without TF (70% vs. 30%, p < 0.05). Interestingly, infection with non-B variants reduced the risk of TDR to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and increased the risk to PIs. Conclusion HIV-1 non-B-infected patients in Spain had a particular epidemiological and clinical profile that should be considered during their clinical management.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0213005X15002918;1.8;1.7;1.7;0213005X;;;

Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY licenseBackground HIV-1 drug resistance to older thymidine analogue nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor drugs has been identified in sub-Saharan Africa in patients with virological failure of first-line combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) containing the modern nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of thymidine analogue mutations (TAM) in patients with virological failure of first-line tenofovir-containing ART. Methods We retrospectively analysed patients from 20 studies within the TenoRes collaboration who had locally defined viral failure on first-line therapy with tenofovir plus a cytosine analogue (lamivudine or emtricitabine) plus a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI; nevirapine or efavirenz) in sub-Saharan Africa. Baseline visits in these studies occurred between 2005 and 2013. To assess between-study and within-study associations, we used meta-regression and meta-analyses to compare patients with and without TAMs for the presence of resistance to tenofovir, cytosine analogue, or NNRTIs. Findings Of 712 individuals with failure of first-line tenofovir-containing regimens, 115 (16%) had at least one TAM. In crude comparisons, patients with TAMs had lower CD4 counts at treatment initiation than did patients without TAMs (60·5 cells per L [IQR 21·0–128·0] in patients with TAMS vs 95·0 cells per L [37·0–177·0] in patients without TAMs; p=0·007) and were more likely to have tenofovir resistance (93 [81%] of 115 patients with TAMs vs 352 [59%] of 597 patients without TAMs; p<0·0001), NNRTI resistance (107 [93%] vs 462 [77%]; p<0·0001), and cytosine analogue resistance (100 [87%] vs 378 [63%]; p=0·0002). We detected associations between TAMs and drug resistance mutations both between and within studies; the correlation between the study-level proportion of patients with tenofovir resistance and TAMs was 0·64 (p<0·0001), and the odds ratio for tenofovir resistance comparing patients with and without TAMs was 1·29 (1·13–1·47; p<0·0001) Interpretation TAMs are common in patients who have failure of first-line tenofovir-containing regimens in sub-Saharan Africa, and are associated with multidrug resistant HIV-1. Effective viral load monitoring and point-of-care resistance tests could help to mitigate the emergence and spread of such strains.

Evidence is accumulating that components of cART can itself be neurotoxic upon long-term exposure. In addition, abuse of psychostimulants, such as methamphetamine (METH), seems to compromise antiretroviral therapy and aggravate HAND. However, the combined effect of virus and recreational and therapeutic drugs on the brain is still incompletely understood. However, several lines of evidence suggest a shared critical role of oxidative stress, compromised neuronal energy homeostasis and autophagy in promotion and prevention of neuronal dysfunction associated with HIV-1 infection, cART and psychostimulant use.

The combination of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor romidepsin and protein kinase C (PKC) agonist bryostatin-1 is very effective at reversing latency in vitro. However, we found that primary HIV-1 specific CD8 + T cells were not able to eliminate autologous resting CD4 + T cells that had been reactivated with these drugs. We tested the hypothesis that the drugs affected primary CD8 + T cell function and found that both agents had inhibitory effects on the suppressive capacity of HIV-specific CD8 + T cells from patients who control viral replication without antiretroviral therapy (elite suppressors/controllers). The inhibitory effect was additive and multi-factorial in nature. These inhibitory effects were not seen with prostratin, another PKC agonist, either alone or in combination with JQ1, a bromodomain-containing protein 4 inhibitor. Our results suggest that because of their adverse effects on primary CD8 + T cells, some LRAs may cause immune-suppression and therefore should be used with caution in shock and kill strategies.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352396416301542;6.0;8.4;8.7;;;;

The current study was to evaluate echocardiographic abnormalities in HIV positive patients under an antiretroviral therapy (ART) program in Tehran, Imam Khomeini Hospital, Iran. Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study, conducted among 231 HIV-1 positive patients under ART. All HIV positive patients including 150 men (65%) and 81 women (35%) (mean age of 41 years) were assessed by trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) in Imam Khomeini Hospital, over the period from 2013 to 2014. Results: The mean CD4 count was 408 cell/l, and the average left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 59.5%. There was an inverse correlation between age and LVEF level. Nevirapine users showed a significantly higher LVEF than non-users. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) was diagnosed in 5.6% along with the increase in age, while left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) was reported in 19.5% of patients associated with age and smoking. Here, the mean systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (SPAP) was only 20 mmHg and just four percent of the patients suffered pulmonary hypertension. Almost 44% had a heart valve disorder among which mitral valve prolapse is the most common problem. Pericardial effusion was not found in any patients. Conclusion: It seems that heart disorders with no suggestive symptoms in HIV positive patients, and mainly older adults who have traditional risk factors for heart diseases, should be seriously considered by health providers.;http://www.eurekaselect.com/openurl/content.php?genre=article&issn=1871-5265&volume=17&issue=1&spage=43;2.1;1.9;1.4;18715265;;;

A retrospective cohort study was carried out to evaluate the trends of drug resistance in antiretroviral treatment-exposed individuals in a state of a middle-income country, Minas Gerais, southeast region of Brazil. We analyzed 2115 HIV-1 sequences from 2002 up to 2012, from 52 cities of Minas Gerais. The groups were analyzed according to the definitions: “IAS – 3 class mutations”, if 1 drug resistance mutation from IAS 2015 list (DRM) was present in each class; “No fully susceptible drugs” as the absence of any fully susceptible drug in Stanford algorithm; and “GSS  2, when a maximum calculated GSS (genotypic susceptibility score) was 2 or 3, counting only drugs available in Brazil and USA at given calendar years. Time trends of resistance were analyzed by Cochran–Armitage test. We observed a decrease in the rate resistance mutations for PI, NRTI, “IAS – 3 class mutations”, and “No fully susceptible drugs” over these 11 years, from 69.2% to 20.7%, 92.3% to 90.2%, 46.2% to 22.5%, and 12.8% to 5.7%, respectively (p < 0.05). Resistance to NNRTI increased from 74.4% to 81.6%, mainly because of K103N mutation. The GSS score 2 increased during the years from 35.9% to 87.3% (p < 0.001). We demonstrate that resistance to PI and to the three main classes simultaneously are declining, although the number of patients on of antiretroviral therapy has doubled in the last ten years in Brazil (125,000 in 2002 to 400,000 in 2014). Broader resistance testing and the availability of more therapeutic options might have influenced this decline. The increase in NNRTI resistance can limit this class as first line treatment in Brazil in the future.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1413867016306523;2.5;3.0;3.2;14138670;;;

Toxicities, drug interactions and costs related to cART still warrant the search for improved treatment options. Dolutegravir's high resistance barrier might make it suitable as antiretroviral maintenance monotherapy. The feasibility of this strategy is currently unknown. Methods: This is a prospective case series on five consecutive HIV-1-infected patients on cART without previous virological failure who switched to dolutegravir monotherapy. All were HIV-RNA suppressed <50 copies/mL and had contraindications to current and alternative combinations of antiretroviral drugs. HIV-RNAwas measured at baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12 and every 6 weeks thereafter. Patients would be switched back to their original cART upon confirmed HIV-RNA >50 copies/mL. Results: The five patients had been HIV-RNA suppressed <50 copies/mL for 1.5 years prior to the initiation of dolutegravir monotherapy. All were on NNRTI-containing regimens at the switch. HIV-RNA remained <50 copies/mL at all timepoints in four patients. One patient, with end-stage renal disease and on calcium supplements, had a pre-cART HIV-RNA of 625000 copies/mL with a CD4 nadir of 120 cells/mm3 and had HIV-RNA of 8150 copies/mL at week 30. The dolutegravir Ctrough was 0.18 mg/L. This patient did not have acquired resistance or evidence of adherence problems and HIV-RNA was resuppressed after switching to his former cART. Conclusions: This case series indicates that dolutegravir monotherapy might be a valuable maintenance option in selected HIV-infected patients who are well suppressed on cART, if confirmed by future randomized clinical trials.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dkw011;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

This was a longitudinal study of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum dynamics of several biomarkers related to inflammation, the blood-brain barrier, neuronal injury, and IgG intrathecal synthesis in serial samples of CSF and serum from a patient infected with HIV-1 subtype C with CNS compartmentalization. The phylogenetic analyses of plasma and CSF samples in an acute phase using next-generation sequencing and F-statistics analysis of C2-V3 haplotypes revealed distinct compartmentalized CSF viruses in paired CSF and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples. The CSF biomarker analysis in this patient showed that symptomatic CSF escape is accompanied by CNS inflammation, high levels of cell and humoral immune biomarkers, CNS barrier dysfunction, and an increase in neuronal injury biomarkers with demyelization. Independent and isolated HIV replication can occur in the CNS, even in HIV-1 subtype C, leading to compartmentalization and development of quasispecies distinct from the peripheral plasma. These immunological aspects of the HIV CNS escape have not been described previously. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CNS HIV escape and compartmentalization in HIV-1 subtype C.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13365-017-0518-z;5.0;4.6;4.7;13550284;;;

Few data guide the selection of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for patients with such resistance. Methods: We reviewed treatment outcomes in a cohort of HIV-1-infected patients with isolated NNRTI TDR who initiated ART between April 2002 and May 2014. In an as-treated analysis, virological failure (VF) was defined as not reaching undetectable virus levels within 24 weeks, virological rebound, or switching regimens during viremia. In an intention-to-treat analysis, failure was defined more broadly as VF, loss to follow-up, and switching during virological suppression. Results: Of 3245 patients, 131 (4.0%) had isolated NNRTI TDR; 122 received a standard regimen comprising 2 NRTIs plus a boosted protease inhibitor (bPI; n = 54), an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI; n = 52), or an NNRTI (n = 16). The median follow-up was 100 weeks. In the as-treated analysis, VF occurred in 15% (n = 8), 2% (n = 1), and 25% (n = 4) of patients in the bPI, INSTI, and NNRTI groups, respectively. In multivariate regression, there was a trend toward a lower risk of VF with INSTIs than with bPIs (hazard ratio: 0.14; 95% confidence interval: 0.02 to 1.1; P = 0.07). In intention-to-treat multivariate regression, INSTIs had a lower risk of failure than bPIs (hazard ratio: 0.38; 95% confidence interval: 0.18 to 0.82; P = 0.01). Conclusions: Patients with isolated NNRTI TDR experienced low VF rates with INSTIs and bPIs. INSTIs were noninferior to bPIs in an analysis of VF but superior to bPIs when frequency of switching and loss to follow-up were also considered.";http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201606010-00007;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

A first-generation MI, bevirimat, showed clinical efficacy in early-phase studies, but 50% of subjects had viruses with reduced susceptibility associated with naturally occurring polymorphisms in Gag near the site of MI action. MI potency was optimized using a panel of engineered reporter viruses containing site-directed polymorphic changes in Gag that reduce susceptibility to bevirimat (including V362I, V370A/M/, and T371A/), leading incrementally to the identification of BMS-955176. BMS-955176 exhibits potent activity (50% effective concentration [EC50], 3.9 ± 3.4 nM [mean ± standard deviation]) toward a library (n = 87) of gag/pr recombinant viruses representing 96.5% of subtype B polymorphic Gag diversity near the CA/SP1 cleavage site. BMS-955176 exhibited a median EC50 of 21 nM toward a library of subtype B clinical isolates assayed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Potent activity was maintained against a panel of reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase inhibitor-resistant viruses, with EC50s similar to those for the wild-type virus. A 5.4-fold reduction in EC50 occurred in the presence of 40% human serum plus 27 mg/ml of human serum albumin (HSA), which corresponded well to an in vitro measurement of 86% human serum binding. Time-of-addition and pseudotype reporter virus studies confirm a mechanism of action for the compound that occurs late in the virus replication cycle. BMS-955176 inhibits HIV-1 protease cleavage at the CA/SP1 junction within Gag in virus-like particles (VLPs) and in HIV-1-infected cells, and it binds reversibly and with high affinity to assembled Gag in purified HIV-1 VLPs. Finally, in vitro combination studies showed no antagonistic interactions with representative antiretrovirals (ARVs) of other mechanistic classes. In conclusion, BMS-955176 is a second-generation MI with potent in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity and a greatly improved preclinical profile compared to that of bevirimat.;https://aac.asm.org/content/60/7/3956;7.8;7.9;8.3;00664804;;;

Methods: A nationwide retrospective cohort from 42 health facilities was assessed for virological failure and development of HIVDR mutations. Data were collected at ART initiation and at 12 months of ART on patients with available HIV-1 viral load (VL) and ART adherence measurements. HIV resistance genotyping was performed on patients with VL 1000 copies/ml. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with treatment failure. Results: Of 828 patients, 66% were women, and the median age was 37 years. Of the 597 patients from whom blood samples were collected, 86.9% were virologically suppressed, while 11.9% were not. Virological failure was strongly associated with age <25 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 6.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.2–12.9), low adherence (aOR: 2.87; 95% CI: 1.5–5.0) and baseline CD4 counts <200 cells/l (aOR 3.4; 95% CI: 1.9–6.2). Overall, 9.1% of all patients on ART had drug resistance mutations after 1 year of ART; 27% of the patients who failed treatment had no evidence of HIVDR mutations. HIVDR mutations were not observed in patients on the recommended second-line ART regimen in Rwanda. Conclusions: The last step of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 target appears within grasp, with some viral failures still due to non-adherence. Nonetheless, youth and late initiators are at higher risk of virological failure. Youth-focused programmes could help prevent further drug HIVDR development.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/tmi.12717;5.3;4.7;4.5;13602276;;;

Objectives We aimed at monitoring residual plasma HIV-1RNA and total cellular HIV-1DNA in virologically suppressed patients switching to raltegravir-based regimens. Study design Fifty-eight subjects on protease inhibitor (PI) or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimens, with plasma HIV-1RNA levels <40 copies/ml for 6 months and CD4 counts >200 cells/l for 12 months were enrolled. Thirty-four patients were from the treatment simplification RASTA randomized study switching standard therapy to a raltegravir-based regimen (RASTA group), while 24 continued a PI or NNRTI based-regimen (controls). Residual plasma HIV-1RNA (5-40 copies/mL) and HIV-1DNA were assessed at 0, 24 and 48 weeks. Results At week 0 (W0), HIV-1DNA was detected in all patients while at W48 it was detectable in 82.4% of the RASTA group vs 100% of controls (p = 0.03). There was a significant decline of HIV-1DNA at W48 in the RASTA group (mean change from baseline 0.21 [95% CI 0.41; 0.01] log10 copies/106 CD4; p = 0.03) but not in controls. Ultrasensitive HIV-1RNA was detectable at baseline in 50% of RASTA group vs 67% of controls and at W48 in 32.4% vs 42%, respectively. No differences were found between HIV-1RNA levels at baseline and W48 within and between groups. Conclusions Switching successful therapy to raltegravir-based regimens may be associated with a decrease of the HIV-1 reservoir, as measured by peripheral blood cellular HIV-1DNA levels.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S138665321730094X;5.7;6.0;5.9;13866532;;;

All Rights Reserved.Most patients failing antiretroviral treatment in Uganda continue to fail their treatment regimen even if a dominant drug-resistant HIV-1 genotype is not detected. In a recent retrospective study, we observed that approximately 30% of HIV-infected individuals in the Joint Clinical Research Centre (Kampala, Uganda) experienced virologic failure with a susceptible HIV-1 genotype based on standard Sanger sequencing. Selection of minority drug-resistant HIV-1 variants (not detectable by Sanger sequencing) under antiretroviral therapy pressure can lead to a shift in the viral quasispecies distribution, becoming dominant members of the virus population and eventually causing treatment failure. Here, we used a novel HIV-1 genotyping assay based on deep sequencing (DeepGen) to quantify low-level drug-resistant HIV-1 variants in 33 patients failing a first-line antiretroviral treatment regimen in the absence of drug-resistant mutations, as screened by standard population-based Sanger sequencing. Using this sensitive assay, we observed that 64% (21/33) of these individuals had low-frequency (or minority) drug-resistant variants in the intrapatient HIV-1 population, which correlated with treatment failure. Moreover, the presence of these minority HIV-1 variants was associated with higher intrapatient HIV-1 diversity, suggesting a dynamic selection or fading of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants from the viral quasispecies in the presence or absence of drug pressure, respectively. This study identified lowfrequency HIV drug resistance mutations by deep sequencing in Ugandan patients failing antiretroviral treatment but lacking dominant drug resistance mutations as determined by Sanger sequencing methods. We showed that these low-abundance drugresistant viruses could have significant consequences for clinical outcomes, especially if treatment is not modified based on a susceptible HIV-1 genotype by Sanger sequencing. Therefore, we propose to make clinical decisions using more sensitive methods to detect minority HIV-1 variants.;https://aac.asm.org/content/60/6/3380;7.8;7.9;8.3;00664804;;;

In 1990, he underwent radiation, chemotherapy, and ultimately, a unilateral nephrectomy for Wilms' tumor. Because of previous reports of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-induced nephrotoxicity, our objective was to evaluate and monitor our patient's renal function over the course of 19 months based on serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance using the Cockroft-Gault equation, estimated glomerular filtration rate using the modification of diet in renal disease formula and urinalyses. After experiencing gastrointestinal side effects from other antiretroviral agents, our patient was switched to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in June 2013. At baseline, his serum creatinine was 1.35 mg/dL, estimated creatinine clearance 68.7 mL/min (based on actual body weight of 71.8 kg), estimated glomerular filtration rate 72.9 mL/min/1.73 m2, with a CD4 cell count of 119 cells/mm3 (5%) and an undetectable HIV viral load. In March 2015, his weight was 73.2 kg, serum creatinine 1.42 mg/dL, estimated creatinine clearance 65.2 mL/min, estimated glomerular filtration rate 68.1 mL/min/1.73 m2, with a CD4 cell count of 120 cells/mm3 (10%) and an undetectable HIV viral load. Other authors have reported tenofovir-induced nephrotoxicity in patients with a solitary kidney. Our patient had no evidence of nephrotoxicity over the course of 19 months on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based antiretroviral therapy (ART). He maintained adequate renal function, comparable to his baseline renal function. Our case report suggests that a tenofovir disoproxil fumurate-based ART may be a viable option for some patients with a solitary kidney.

Objectives: To determine whether or not efavirenz (EFV)-based ART in short cycles of 5 days on and 2 days off is as efficacious (in maintaining virological suppression) as continuous EFV-based ART (continuous therapy; CT). Secondary objectives included the occurrence of new clinical HIV events or death, changes in immunological status, emergence of HIV drug resistance, drug toxicity and changes in therapy. Design: Open, randomised, non-inferiority trial. Setting: Europe, Thailand, Uganda, Argentina and the USA. Participants: Young people (aged 8–24 years) on EFV plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and with a HIV-1 ribonucleic acid level [viral load (VL)] of < 50 copies/ml for > 12 months. Interventions: Young people were randomised to continue daily ART (CT) or change to SCT (5 days on, 2 days off ART). Main outcome measures: Follow-up was for a minimum of 48 weeks (0, 4 and 12 weeks and then 12-weekly visits). The primary outcome was the difference between arms in the proportion with VL > 50 copies/ml (confirmed) by 48 weeks, estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method (12% non-inferiority margin) adjusted for region and age. Results: In total, 199 young people (11 countries) were randomised (n = 99 SCT group, n = 100 CT group) and followed for a median of 86 weeks. Overall, 53% were male; the median age was 14 years (21%  18 years); 13% were from the UK, 56% were black, 19% were Asian and 21% were Caucasian; and the median CD4% and CD4 count were 34% and 735 cells/mm3, respectively. By week 48, only one participant (CT) was lost to follow-up. The SCT arm had a 27% decreased drug exposure as measured by the adherence questionnaire and a MEMSCap™ Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMSCap Inc., Durham, NC, USA) substudy (median cap openings per week: SCT group, n = 5; CT group, n = 7). By 48 weeks, six participants in the SCT group and seven in the CT group had a confirmed VL > 50 copies/ml [difference –1.2%, 90% confidence interval (CI) –7.3% to 4.9%] and two in the SCT group and four in the CT group had a confirmed VL > 400 copies/ml (difference –2.1%, 90% CI –6.2% to 1.9%). All six participants in the SCT group with a VL > 50 copies/ml resumed daily ART, of whom five were resuppressed, three were on the same regimen and two with a switch; two others on SCT resumed daily ART for other reasons. Overall, three participants in the SCT group and nine in the CT group (p = 0.1) changed ART regimen, five because of toxicity, four for simplification reasons, two because of compliance issues and one because of VL failure. Seven young people (SCT group, n = 2; CT group, n = 5) had major non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations at VL failure, of whom two (n = 1 SCT group, n = 1 CT group) had the M184V mutation. Two young people had new Centers for Disease Control B events (SCT group, n = 1; CT group, n = 1). There were no significant differences between SCT and CT in grade 3/4 adverse events (13 vs. 14) or in serious adverse events (7 vs. 6); there were fewer ART-related adverse events in the SCT arm (2 vs. 14; p = 0.02). At week 48 there was no evidence that SCT led to increased inflammation using an extensive panel of markers. Young people expressed a strong preference for SCT in a qualitative substudy and in pre- and post-trial questionnaires. In total, 98% of the young people are taking part in a 2-year follow-up extension of the trial. Conclusions: Non-inferiority of VL suppression in young people on EFV-based first-line ART with a VL of < 50 copies/ml was demonstrated for SCT compared with CT, with similar resistance, safety and inflammatory marker profiles. The SCT group had fewer ART-related adverse events. Further evaluation of the immunological and virological impact of SCT is ongoing. A limitation of the trial is that the results cannot be generalised to settings where VL monitoring is either not available or infrequent, nor to use of low-dose EFV. Two-year extended follow-up of the trial is ongoing to confirm the durability of the SCT strategy. Further trials of SCT in settings with infrequent VL monitoring and with other antiretroviral drugs such as tenofovir alafenamide, which has a long intracellular half-life, and/or dolutegravir, which has a higher barrier to resistance, are planned.";https://www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk/hta/hta20490/;7.5;7.8;6.9;13665278;;;

We sought to identify the memory CD4 T cell populations in blood and LNs that are responsible for the production of replication-competent and infectious HIV-1, as well as for active and persistent virus transcription in ART-treated (for 1.5-14.0 years), aviremic (<50 HIV RNA copies/ml) HIV-infected individuals. We demonstrate that LN CD4 T cells that express programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1; also known as PD-1), which are composed of about 65% T follicular helper cells as defined by the expression of the cell surface receptors CXCR5 and PD-1, are the major source of replication-competent HIV-1 and of infectious virus, as compared to any other (CXCR5 - PD-1- and CXCR5+ PD-1-) blood or LN memory CD4 T cell populations. LN PD-1+ cells accounted for 46% and 96% of the total pools of memory CD4 T cells containing inducible replication-competent or infectious virus, respectively. Notably, higher levels of cell-associated HIV-1 RNA were present in LN PD-1+ cells after long-term (up to 12 years) ART than in other memory CD4 T cell subpopulations. These results indicate that LN PD-1+ cells are the major CD4 T cell compartment in the blood and LNs for the production of replication-competent and infectious HIV-1, and for active and persistent virus transcription in long-term-ART-treated aviremic individuals. Thus, these cells may represent a major obstacle to finding a functional cure for HIV-1 infection.";http://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4113;47.5;48.3;45.9;10788956;;;

However, the ideal duration of treatment with interferon-free regimens, particularly in HIV-coinfected individuals, remains unknown. We assessed the efficacy and safety of 6 weeks of ledipasvir–sofosbuvir for acute genotype 1 or 4 HCV in HIV-1-coinfected patients. Methods This open-label, single-arm trial, done in Germany and the UK, included patients with acute HCV genotype 1 or 4 and HIV-1. At screening, patients were either receiving HIV antiretrovirals and had HIV RNA less than 200 copies per mL, or not receiving antiretrovirals and had a CD4 T-cell count of greater than 500 cells per L. All patients received ledipasvir–sofosbuvir once daily for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with sustained virological response 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02457611. Findings Between June 11, 2015, and Jan 8, 2016, we enrolled and treated 26 patients. All (100%) were men, 24 (92%) were white, and 25 (96%) were receiving antiretroviral treatment. 19 (73%) had genotype 1a and seven (27%) had genotype 4 HCV. Overall, 20 (77%; 95% CI 56–91) of 26 patients achieved SVR12: 15 (79%) of 19 with genotype 1a, and five (71%) of seven with genotype 4. Of six patients not achieving SVR12, three relapsed, two achieved sustained virological response 4 weeks after the end of treatment but were lost to follow-up, and one was reinfected. The most common adverse events were fatigue (seven participants [27%]), nasopharyngitis (seven [27%]), and headache (six [23%]). No patient discontinued or interrupted therapy due to adverse events. No HIV rebound occurred during the study. Interpretation The rate of cure with a fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir–sofosbuvir for patients with acute genotype 1 or 4 HCV infection and HIV-1 coinfection is similar to historic rates with interferon-based treatment, but with shorter treatment duration and more favourable safety outcomes.

Methods: Remnant dried blood spots from HIV-infected children (aged <18 months) tested through the Togo national early infant diagnosis program during 2012 and 2013 were collected and assessed for HIV drug resistance. Pol-RT (reverse transcriptase) region was amplified, sequenced and analyzed for the presence of drug resistance mutations (DRMs). Results: Overall, 121 of 201 (60.2%) newly diagnosed children had detectable DRMs. Among the 131 of 201 (65.2%) children with reported exposure to maternal and/or infant antiretrovirals (ARVs), DRMs were detected in 99 children (75.6%). Importantly, in 41 of 201 children for whom no exposure to ARVs was reported, DRMs were detected in 11 children (26.8%). For 29 children, no data on ARV exposure were available. For the 121 of 201 children with DRMs, 99 of 121 (81.8%) had only nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor DRMs detected but 21 of 121 (17.3%) had both nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) DRMs. Among breast-fed children, drug resistance was more frequent when mothers were on antiretroviral therapy (ART), 61 of 75 (81.3%) versus 14 of 39 (35.9%) when mothers were not on ART (P < 0.001). Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance was more common when mothers were on ART. Conclusions: Scale-up and improvement of PMTCT strategies resulted in a global decrease of pediatric HIV infections, but our study shows high rates of drug resistance in infants for whom prevention failed.;http://journals.lww.com/00006454-201608000-00011;4.7;4.4;3.9;08913668;;;

The test can be run on either the semi-automated SAMBA I system for clinical use or the fully automated, including readout, SAMBA II system for point-of-care use in resource-limited settings. We have assessed the performance characteristics of the SAMBA HIV-1 Qual Whole Blood Test on SAMBA I and SAMBA II. The limit of detection obtained for the two tests were 518 IU/ml and 399 copies/ml on SAMBA I and 457 IU/ml and 433 copies/ml on SAMBA II. Test specificity on both systems was 100% with a panel of 503 HIV-1 negative samples. Evaluation of test reproducibility showed 100% concordance with expected gold standard results as well as 100% agreement between operators, days, and runs as well as within runs on both SAMBA I and SAMBA II. Our results thus show that the SAMBA HIV-1 Qual Whole Blood Test performs equivalently on SAMBA I and SAMBA II, and also suggest that the test is suitable for implementation in medium-throughput clinical facilities (SAMBA I) or low-throughput point-of-care (POC) settings (SAMBA II) in resource-poor regions.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166093416303342;3.5;3.3;3.4;01660934;;;

All rights reserved.Background: Despite the high prevalence of HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C) worldwide, information on HIV-1C viral dynamics and response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is limited. We sought to measure viral load decay dynamics during treatment and estimate the within-host basic reproductive ratio, R 0, and the critical efficacy,  c, for successful treatment of HIV-1C infection. Methods: Individuals initiated on first-line ART in India and monitored for 6 months of treatment were considered. Viral load, CD4 + count, and adherence data were collected at baseline, 4, 12, 16 and 24 weeks after ART initiation. Drug resistance genotyping was performed at baseline. R 0 and  c were estimated using a mathematical model. Results: Among 257 patients with complete data, mean baseline viral load was 5.7 log 10 copies per milliliter and median CD4 + count was 165 cells per cubic millimeter. Primary drug resistance was present in 3.1% at baseline. At 6 months, 87.5% had undetectable viral load, indicating excellent response to ART despite high baseline viremia. After excluding those with transmitted resistance, suboptimal adherence and viral rebound, data from 112 patients were analyzed using a mathematical model. We estimated the median R 0 to be 5.3. The corresponding  c was 0.8. Conclusions: These estimates of R 0 and  c are smaller than current estimates for HIV-1B, suggesting that HIV-1C exhibits lower in vivo fitness compared with HIV-1B, which allows successful treatment despite high baseline viral loads. The lower fitness, and potentially lower virulence, together with high viral loads may underlie the heightened transmission potential of HIV-1C and its growing global spread.;http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201611010-00001;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

We report rilpivirine safety, efficacy, virology and pharmacokinetics in adolescents during 48 weeks of treatment (Cohort 1, Part 2). Methods: PAINT (NCT00799864) is a phase II, ongoing, open-label, single-arm trial of rilpivirine plus 2 investigator-selected nucleoside/nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. Cohort 1 of PAINT includes treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected adolescents (12 to <18 years). Following approval in adults and after Part 1a in Cohort 1, enrollment was restricted to screening viral load (VL) 100,000 copies/mL. Results: Overall, 20 (56%) of 36 patients were women, 18 (50%) were aged 12 to <15 years, 32 (89%) were Black or African American, mostly from South Africa or Uganda, and 28 (78%) had baseline VL 100,000 copies/mL. At week 48, adverse events considered possibly related to treatment occurred in 13 (36%) patients, mostly (excluding investigations) somnolence (n = 5, 14%) and nausea (n = 2, 6%). Most adverse events were grade 1 or 2, and 7 (19%) patients had grade 3 or 4 adverse events. Week 48 virologic response (VL <50 copies/mL, time-to-loss-of-virologic-response) was achieved in 26 of the 36 (72%) patients: 22 of the 28 (79%) with baseline VL 100,000 copies/mL and 4 of the 8 (50%) with baseline VL >100,000 copies/mL. Median (range) CD4 + count increased by 184 (-135 to 740) cells/mm 3 at week 48. Eight patients experienced virologic failure, including 5 who developed rilpivirine resistance-associated mutations, mostly E138K, K101E and M230L. Mean (standard deviation) rilpivirine area-under-the-concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC 24h and C 0h) were 2391 (991) ng·h/mL and 83.5 (38.7) ng/mL, respectively. Conclusions: Rilpivirine safety, virologic and pharmacokinetic profiles were similar in treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected adolescents and adults, supporting use of rilpivirine 25 mg qd, plus other antiretrovirals, in treatment-naïve adolescents with VL 100,000 copies/mL at treatment initiation.;http://journals.lww.com/00006454-201611000-00013;4.7;4.4;3.9;08913668;;;

EPCs may be reduced in HIV-infected (HIV+) persons, contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Telmisartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker that increases EPCs in HIV-uninfected adults. Objective: To assess telmisartan’s effects on EPC number and immunophenotype in older HIV + adults at risk for CVD. Methods: HIV + persons 50 years old with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL on suppressive antiretroviral therapy and 1 CVD risk factor participated in a prospective, open-label, pilot study of oral telmisartan 80 mg daily for 12 weeks. Using CD34 and CD133 as markers of early maturity and KDR as a marker of endothelial lineage commitment, EPCs were quantified via flow cytometry and defined as viable CD3/CD33/CD19/glycophorin cells of four immunophenotypes: CD133+/KDR+, CD34+/KDR+, CD34+/CD133+, or CD34+/KDR+/CD133+. The primary endpoint was a 12-week change in EPC subsets (NCT01578772). Results: Seventeen participants (88% men, median age 60 years and peripheral CD4+ T lymphocyte count 625 cells/mm3) enrolled and completed the study. After 6 and 12 weeks of telmisartan, frequencies of all EPC immunophenotypes were higher than baseline (all p < 0.10 except week 12 CD133+/KDR+ EPC, p = 0.13). Participants with lower baseline EPC levels had the largest gains. Additionally, the percentage of CD34+ cells with endothelial commitment (KDR+) increased. Conclusions: Our data suggest that telmisartan use is associated with an increase in circulating EPCs in older HIV + individuals with CVD risk factors. Further controlled studies are needed to assess whether EPC increases translate to a reduction in CVD risk in this population.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15284336.2016.1234222;2.8;2.7;0;15284336;;;

Methods Dried blood spots (DBS) were collected from November 2012 to December 2013 from 69 HIV-1 infected women participating in a prevention of mother-to-child transmission program in the Hospital Regional of Bata and Primary Health Care Centre María Rafols, Bata, GQ. The transmitted (TDR) or acquired (ADR) antiretroviral drug resistance mutations at partial pol sequence among naive or antiretroviral therapy (ART)-exposed women were defined following WHO or IAS USA 2015 lists, respectively. HIV-1 variants were identified by phylogenetic analyses. Results A total of 38 of 69 HIV-1 specimens were successfully amplified and sequenced. Thirty (79%) belonged to ART-experienced women: 15 exposed to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) monotherapy, and 15 to combined ART (cART) as first regimen including two NRTI and one non-NRTI (NNRTI) or one protease inhibitor (PI). The TDR rate was only found for PI (3.4%). The ADR rate was 37.5% for NNRTI, 8.7% for NRTI and absent for PI or NRTI+NNRTI. HIV-1 group M non-B variants caused most (97.4%) infections, mainly (78.9%) recombinants: CRF02-AG (55.2%), CRF22-A101 (10.5%), subtype C (10.5%), unique recombinants (5.3%), and A3, D, F2, G, CRF06-cpx and CRF11-cpx (2.6% each). Conclusions The high rate of ADR to retrotranscriptase inhibitors (mainly to NNRTIs) observed among pretreated pregnant women reinforces the importance of systematic DRM monitoring in GQ to reduce HIV-1 resistance transmission and to optimize first and second-line ART regimens when DRM are present.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165333;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0165333;;

We evaluated whether subtype influenced rates of virological failure in a cohort of 8746 patients from the United Kingdom who received a standard tenofovir-containing first-line regimen and were followed for a median of 3.3 years. In unadjusted analyses, the rate of failure was approximately 2-fold higher among patients infected with subtype C virus as compared to those with subtype B virus (hazard ratio [HR], 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50-2.31; P <. 001). However, the increased risk was greatly attenuated in analyses adjusting for demographic and clinical factors (adjusted HR, 1.14; 95% CI,. 83-1.58; P =. 41).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the accumulation of resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors after continued virological failure on first-line ART, among adults and children in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: HIV-1-positive adults and children on an NNRTI-based first-line ART were included. Retrospective VL and, if VL 1000 copies/mL, pol genotypic testing was performed. Among participants with continued virological failure (2 VL 1000 copies/mL), drug resistance was evaluated. Results: At first virological failure, DRM(s) were detected in 87% of participants: K103N (38.7%), G190A (21.8%), Y181C (20.2%), V106M (8.4%), K101E (8.4%), any E138 (7.6%) and V108I (7.6%) associated with NNRTIs, and M184V (69.7%), any thymidine analogue mutation (9.2%), K65R (5.9%) and K70R (5.0%) associated with NRTIs. New DRMs accumulated with an average rate of 1.45 (SD 2.07) DRM per year; 0.62 (SD 1.11) NNRTI DRMs and 0.84 (SD 1.38) NRTI DRMs per year, respectively. The predicted susceptibility declined significantly after continued virological failure for all reverse transcriptase inhibitors (all P < 0.001). Acquired drug resistance patterns were similar in adults and children. Conclusions: Patterns of drug resistance after virological failure on first-line ART are similar in adults and children in sub-Saharan Africa. Improved VL monitoring to prevent accumulation of mutations, and new drug classes to construct fully active regimens, are required.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dkw218;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;dkw218;;

We sought to identify factors associated with the risk of viral load rebound in this trial. Methods: PIVOT was a randomized controlled trial in HIV-positive adults with suppressed viral load for at least 24 weeks on combination therapy comparing a strategy of physician-selected ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor monotherapy versus ongoing triple therapy. In participants receivingmonotherapy,weanalysed time to confirmed viral load rebound and its predictors using flexible parametric survival models. Results: Of 290 participants initiating protease inhibitor monotherapy (80% darunavir, 14% lopinavir, and 6% other), 93 developed viral load rebound on monotherapy. The risk of viral load rebound peaked at 9 months after starting monotherapy and then declined to approximately 5 per 100 person-years from 18 months onwards. Independent predictors of viral load rebound were duration of viral load suppression before starting monotherapy (hazard ratio 0.81 per additional year <50 copies/ml; P<0.001), CD4+ cell count (hazard ratio 0.73 per additional 100 cells/ml for CD4+ nadir; P=0.008); ethnicity (hazard ratio 1.87 for nonwhite versus white, P=0.025) but not the protease inhibitor agent used (P=0.27). Patients whose viral load was analysed with the Roche TaqMan-2 assay had a 1.87-fold risk for viral load rebound compared with Abbott RealTime assay (P=0.012). Conclusion: A number of factors can identify patients at low risk of rebound with protease inhibitor monotherapy, and this may help to better target those who may benefit from this management strategy.";http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201611130-00007;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

We aimed to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of this single-tablet, fixed-dose combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide in HIV-infected, treatment-naive adolescents. Methods We did a 48 week, single-arm, open-label trial in treatment-naive adolescents with HIV from ten hospital clinics in South Africa, Thailand, Uganda, and the USA. Eligible participants were aged 12–18 years, with plasma HIV-1 RNA of at least 1000 copies per mL, a CD4 count of at least 100 cells per L, and estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 90 mL/min per 1·73 m2 by the Schwartz formula, bodyweight of at least 35 kg, and an HIV-1 genotype with sensitivity to elvitegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. Participants received a single-tablet regimen once per day with food (administered by their parent or carer) containing 150 mg elvitegravir, 150 mg cobicistat, 200 mg emtricitabine, and 10 mg tenofovir alafenamide. Study visits to the clinic occurred at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48. The coprimary endpoints were the pharmacokinetic parameters of area under the curve (AUC) concentration at the end of the dosing interval (AUCtau) for elvitegravir and the AUC from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast) for tenofovir alafenamide, incidence of treatment-emergent serious adverse events, and all adverse events that emerged after treatment started (including data for bone mineral density). All participants who received one dose of study drug were included in the primary and safety analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01854775. Findings Between May 22, 2013, and July 22, 2014, we enrolled 50 participants, and all 50 received the assigned treatment; 24 participated in the intensive pharmacokinetic assessment. 48 patients completed the 48 weeks of treatment; two discontinued (one withdrew consent at week 8, one was lost to follow-up at week 12). The regimen was well tolerated and no discontinuations related to adverse events occurred. The mean AUCtau for elvitegravir was 23 840 ng × h per mL (coefficient of variation [CV] 25·5%), and the mean AUClast for tenofovir alafenamide was 189 ng × h per mL (CV 55·8%). Four participants (8%) had a serious adverse event, one of which (intermediate uveitis) was deemed related to the study regimen but resolved without treatment interruption. The most common study drug-related adverse events were nausea (in ten participants), abdominal pain (in six), and vomiting (in five). Exposures to the elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide regimen were similar to those previously noted in adults. Interpretation The elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide regimen was well tolerated and achieved component plasma pharmacokinetic exposures similar to those in adults. Although non-comparative with a small sample size, these data support the use of this regimen in HIV-infected adolescents and its timely assessment in younger children.

Here, we studied whether or not ART had an impact on the frequency and selection of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) under these settings. We also examined whether differences exist between HIV-1 genetic variants. Design: A total of 3736 sequences from individuals failing standard first-line ART (n=1599, zidovudine/stavudine+lamivudine+neviparine/efavirenz) were analyzed and compared with sequences from reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI)-naive individuals (n=2137) from 10 West and Central African countries. Methods: Fisher exact tests and corrections for multiple comparisons were used to assess the significance of associations. Results: All RTI-DRM from the 2015 International Antiviral Society list, except F227C, and nine mutations from other expert lists were observed to confer extensive resistance and cross-resistance. Five additional independently selected mutations (I94L, L109I, V111L, T139R and T165L) were statistically associated with treatment. The proportion of sequences with multiple mutations and the frequency of all thymidine analog mutations, M184V, certain NNRTIS, I94L and L109I showed substantial increase with time on ART. Only one nucleoside and two nonnucleoside RTI-DRMs differed by subtype/circulating recombinant form. Conclusion: This study validates the global robustness of the actual DRM repertoire, in particular for circulating recombinant form 02 predominating in West and Central Africa, despite our finding of five additional selected mutations. However, long-term ART without virological monitoring clearly leads to the accumulation of mutations and the emergence of additional variations, which limit drug options for treatment and can be transmitted. Improved monitoring and optimization of ART are necessary for the long-term effectiveness of ART.;http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201611130-00003;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

In two open-label, single-dose, randomized, two-period, crossover trials, the bioavailability of doravirine administered alone or in a fixed-dose combination (FDC) was determined under fed and fasted conditions. Methods: Doravirine 100 mg alone or with lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (each 300 mg) were administered to healthy subjects fasted or 30 min after a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast. Twenty-eight subjects, aged 26–55 years, enrolled (doravirine, n = 14; FDC, n = 14). The sequence of fed/fasted treatment was randomized (1:1). Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed as geometric mean ratios (GMRs) with 90% confidence intervals. Results: Doravirine area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity (fed/fasted GMRs: alone 1.16 [1.06–1.26]; FDC 1.10 [1.02–1.20]), AUC from time zero to the last measurement (GMRs: alone 1.18 [1.08–1.29]; FDC 1.10 [1.01–1.20]), and plasma concentration 24 h after administration (GMRs: alone 1.36 [1.19–1.55]; FDC 1.26 [1.13–1.41]) values increased in the fed versus fasted state when administered alone or as the FDC; the magnitude was not clinically meaningful. Doravirine maximum achieved concentration was similar after fed or fasted administration for both doravirine alone and FDC (GMRs: alone 1.03 [0.89–1.19]; FDC 0.95 [0.80–1.12]). The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir and lamivudine in the FDC were also slightly altered by administration with food; the changes were not clinically meaningful. Conclusions: All treatments were generally well tolerated. Food had no clinically meaningful effect on doravirine 100 mg alone or as part of an FDC.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40261-017-0512-5;3.7;3.5;3.9;11732563;;;

Extent of viral suppression from a prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV program in Rwanda was assessed among women enrolled in the Kigali Antiretroviral and Breastfeeding Assessment for the Elimination of HIV (Kabeho) Study. ARV drug resistance testing was conducted on women with VL>2000 copies/ml. In April 2013-January 2014, 608 pregnant or early postpartum HIVpositive women were enrolled in 14 facilities. Factors associated with detectable enrollment VL (>20 copies/ml) were examined using generalized estimating equations. The most common antiretroviral regimen (56.7%, 344/607) was tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz. Median ART duration was 13.5 months (IQR 3.0-48.8); 76.1% of women were on ART at first antenatal visit. Half of women (315/603) had undetectable RNA-PCR VL and 84.6% (510) had <1,000 copies/ml. Detectable VL increased among those on ART > 36 months compared to those on ART 4-36 months (72/191, 37.7% versus 56/187, 29.9%), though the difference was not significant. The odds of having detectable enrollment VL decreased significantly as duration on ART at enrollment increased (AOR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.9857, 0.9998, p = 0.043). There was a higher likelihood of detectable VL for women with lower gravidity (AOR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.84, 0.97, p = 0.0039), no education (AOR = 2.25, (95% CI: 1.37, 3.70, p = 0.0004), nondisclosure to partner (AOR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.21, 3.21, p = 0.0063) and side effects (AOR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.72, 4.03, p<0.0001). ARV drug resistance mutations were detected in all of the eleven women on ART > 36 months with genotyping available. Most women were receiving ART at first antenatal visit, with relatively high viral suppression rates. Shorter ART duration was associated with higher VL, with a concerning increasing trend for higher viremia and drug resistance among women on ART for >3 years.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0168671;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0168671;;

Since HIV transmission is driven by HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL), we studied the association between plasma VL and HIVDR profiles in 451 adults failing first-line ART from the 2LADY-ANRS12169/EDCTP trial in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, and Senegal. Median duration on first-line ART was 49 months (IQR: 33-69) and 91% patients were asymptomatic. Genotypic drug resistance testing was successful for 446 patients and 98.7% of them were resistant to at least one of the first-line drugs; 40.6% and 55.8% were resistant to two or three drugs of their ongoing first-line ART, respectively. The median VL was higher in patients with HIVDR to all ongoing first-line drugs than in those still susceptible to at least one drug; 4.7 log10 copies/ml (IQR: 4.3-5.2) versus 4.2 log10 copies/ml (IQR: 3.7-4.7), respectively (p < .001). The proportion of patients with HIVDR to all ongoing first-line drugs was highest (77.9% [95/122]) in patients with VL >5.0 log10 copies/ml. High rates of cross-resistance to other nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors were observed and were also highest in patients with high VL. Without improvement of patient monitoring to avoid late switch to second-line regimens, a potential new epidemic caused by HIVDR strains could emerge in sub-Saharan Africa and compromise all efforts to reach 90-90-90 UNAIDS objective by 2020.";http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2016.0010;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

However, lack of effectiveness in 2 major women-only PrEP trials, VOICE and FEM-PrEP, continues to be a cause for concern about achieving effectiveness for women in Southern Africa. We conducted a series of meta-analyses of oral effectiveness of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine in women including all 5 randomized placebo-controlled trials that included women. An adherence-based meta-analysis model showed that with high levels of adherence (75%), oral PrEP is estimated to be effective (relative risk 0.39, 95% confidence interval: 0.25 to 0.60). Provided that these results apply to women in Southern Africa, future prevention trial designs in that region should account for potentially reduced HIV incidence when PrEP is available.;http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201612150-00017;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

In part 1, 13 subjects were randomized to 2 arms to receive multiple doses of oral isavuconazole 100 mg either alone or with lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg. In part 2, a different group of 55 subjects were randomized to 3 arms to receive multiple doses of oral isavuconazole 200 mg, either alone or with lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg, or to receive oral lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg alone. Mean area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) following the last dose (AUC) and Cmax of isavuconazole increased by 113% and 96% in part 1 and by 96% and 74% in part 2 in the presence vs absence of lopinavir/ritonavir, respectively. Mean AUC and Cmax of lopinavir were 27% and 23% lower, and mean AUC and Cmax of ritonavir were 31% and 33% lower in the presence vs absence of isavuconazole, respectively. Mild to moderate gastrointestinal disorders were the most common adverse events experienced. These findings indicate that coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir with isavuconazole can decrease the exposure of lopinavir/ritonavir and increase the exposure of isavuconazole. Patients should be monitored for reduced antiviral efficacy if these agents are coadministered.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/cpdd.282;2.4;3.0;3.2;2160763X;;;

Even though TDM can be a valuable strategy in HIV management, its role remains controversial. Areas covered: This review provides a comprehensive update on important issues relating to TDM of ARV drugs in HIV-infected patients. Articles from PubMed with keywords relevant to each topic section were reviewed. Search strategies limited to articles published in English. Expert commentary: There is evidence supporting the use of TDM in HIV treatment. However, some limitations need to be considered. The evidence supporting the use of routine TDM for all patients is limited, as it is not clear that this strategy offers any advantages over TDM for selected indications. Selected groups of patients including patients with physiological changes, patients with drug-drug interactions or toxicity, and the elderly could potentially benefit from TDM, as optimized dosing is challenging in these populations.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17512433.2016.1235972;4.1;4.2;5.1;17512433;;;

HIV-1 RNA can be at higher levels in CSF than plasma, termed CSF/plasma discordance. We aimed to examine whether discordance in CSF is associated with low level viraemia (LLV) in blood. In this MRC-funded multicentre study, we prospectively recruited patients with LLV, defined as one or more episode of unexplained plasma HIV-1 RNA within 12 months, and undertook CSF examination. Separately, we prospectively collected CSF from patients undergoing lumbar puncture for a clinical indication. Patients with durable suppression of viraemia and no evidence of CNS infection were identified as controls from this group. Factors associated with CSF/plasma HIV-1 discordance overall were examined. One hundred fifty-three patients were recruited across 13 sites; 40 with LLV and 113 undergoing clinical lumbar puncture. Seven of the 40 (18 %) patients with LLV had CSF/plasma discordance, which was significantly more than 0/43 (0 %) with durable suppression in blood from the clinical group (p = 0.005). Resistance associated mutations were shown in six CSF samples from discordant patients with LLV (one had insufficient sample for testing), which affected antiretroviral therapy at sampling in five. Overall discordance was present in 20/153 (13 %) and was associated with nadir CD4 but not antiretroviral concentrations in plasma or CSF. CSF/plasma discordance is observed in patients with LLV and is associated with antiretroviral resistance associated mutations in CSF. The implications for clinical practice require further investigation.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13365-016-0448-1;5.0;4.6;4.7;13550284;;;

However, HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) poses a potential threat to the long-term success of ART and is emerging as a threat to the elimination of AIDS as a public health problem by 2030. In this review we describe the genetic mechanisms, epidemiology, and management of HIVDR at both individual and population levels across diverse economic and geographic settings. To describe the genetic mechanisms of HIVDR, we review the genetic barriers to resistance for the most commonly used ARVs and describe the extent of cross-resistance between them. To describe the epidemiology of HIVDR, we summarize the prevalence and patterns of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) and acquired drug resistance (ADR) in both high-income and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We also review to two categories of HIVDR with important public health relevance: (i) pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR), a World Health Organization-recommended HIVDR surveillance metric and (ii) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-related drug resistance, a type of ADR that can impact clinical outcomes if present at the time of treatment initiation. To summarize the implications of HIVDR for patient management, we review the role of genotypic resistance testing and treatment practices in both high-income and LMIC settings. In high-income countries where drug resistance testing is part of routine care, such an understanding can help clinicians prevent virological failure and accumulation of further HIVDR on an individual level by selecting the most efficacious regimens for their patients. Although there is reduced access to diagnostic testing and to many ARVs in LMIC, understanding the scientific basis and clinical implications of HIVDR is useful in all regions in order to shape appropriate surveillance, inform treatment algorithms, and manage difficult cases.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567134816303690;5.2;4.9;5.0;15671348;;;

Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association between specific DRMs and Stanford intermediate-/high-level resistance and factors including REGA subtype, first-line antiretroviral therapy drugs, CD4, and VL at failure. Results: The median first-line treatment duration was 4 years (interquartile range 30-43 months); 42% of participants had VL 100,000 copies/mL and 63% participants had CD4 <100 cells/mm 3. Viral subtype distribution was A1 (40%; Uganda and Kenya), C (31%; Zimbabwe and Malawi), and D (25%; Uganda and Kenya), and recombinant/unclassified (5%). In general, DRMs were more common in subtype-C than in subtype-A and/or subtype-D (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations K65R and Q151M; NNRTI mutations E138A, V106M, Y181C, K101E, and H221Y). The presence of tenofovir resistance was similar between subtypes [P (adjusted) = 0.32], but resistance to zidovudine, abacavir, etravirine, or rilpivirine was more common in subtype-C than in subtype-D/subtype-A [P (adjusted) < 0.02]. Conclusions: Non-B subtypes differ in DRMs at first-line failure, which impacts on residual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and NNRTI susceptibility. In particular, higher rates of etravirine and rilpivirine resistance in subtype-C may limit their potential utility in salvage regimens.";http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201706010-00018;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

Fifty-five chronic HIV-1-infected adults were recruited for this study before initiation of HAART. 30 age and gender matched healthy adults were recruited as control. Blood was obtained from each patient at baseline (0 month) and 12 months after initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy(HAART), and each healthy person. The concentration of serum IL-33 and sST2 were detected by ELISA. plasma HIV RNA was detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. peripheral blood CD3+/CD4+ cell count, the ratio of CD4+ST2L+ positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined by flow cytometry. In HIV-infected patients, serum IL-33 and sST2 levels are higher and percentage of ST2L in PBMCs is lower than normal control significantly. During HAART, serum IL-33 and sST2 levels were decreased, whereas CD4+ST2L+ level was increased in PBMCs gradually. Serum IL-33 and sST2 levels positively correlated with plasma HIV RNA levels, but negatively correlated with the peripheral blood CD3+/CD4+ cell count. CD4+ST2L+ receptor in PBMC are positively correlated with the peripheral blood CD3+/CD4+ cell count, but negatively correlated with the plasma HIV viral loading. Serum IL-33 and sST2 levels, and CD4+ST2L+ expression in PBMCs are closely associated with HIV-1 infection and immune reconstitution in patients received HAART.;https://www.cellmolbiol.org/index.php/CMB/article/view/1263;2.3;2.2;2.5;01455680;;;

However, subnational differences may exist in PDR prevalence and transmission dynamics. Objectives:We longitudinally assessed HIV PDR in three geographic areas of Mexico. Patients and methods: HIV-infected, antiretroviral-naive individuals were recruited from2008 to 2016, from the Central Metropolitan Zone (CMZ), Cancun and Tijuana (1194, 773 and 668 respectively). PDR was estimated using the Stanford HIVdb tool fromplasma HIV pol sequences. Results: A higher proportion of females, lower education and lower employment rate were observed in Tijuana, while a higher proportion of MSM was observed in the CMZ (P < 0.0001, all cases). For 2012-16, PDR was 13.4%, 8.9% and 11.2% in the CMZ, Tijuana and Cancun respectively. NNRTI PDR was highest in the three regions (8.7%, 4.8% and 8.1% respectively, P < 0.05); nevertheless, NNRTI PDR in Tijuana was lower than in the CMZ (P=0.01). For 2008-16, we observed increasing efavirenz resistance trends in all regions (P < 0.05, all cases), reaching 11.8%, 6.1% and 8.3% respectively in 2016. Increasing efavirenz resistance was mostly associated with increasing K103N frequency (P=0.007 CMZ, P=0.03 Tijuana, not significant for Cancun). Conclusions: Our study suggests different NNRTI PDR prevalence and transmission dynamics in three geographical areas of Mexico. Even when increasing trends in efavirenz resistance were observed in the three areas, our observations support that, in a large country such as Mexico, subnational surveillance and locally tailored interventions to address drug resistance may be a reasonable option.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/72/11/3149/4091567;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

A cross sectional design was adopted. HIV infected cases attending Alexandria Fever Hospital (AFH) for one year. Interview questionnaire and four CD+4 counts were done for all patients, HIV VL and delta-32 CCR5 polymorphism were done for selected cases. Sexual transmission and drug abuse are the most important risk factors. Infectious comorbidity increases the rate of HIV progression. CD4+ count at the end of the study; CD+4 (4), count was significantly higher than all other CD4+ readings among the whole cohort and among the treated group. Also, VL at the end of the study; VL(2), was significantly higher than VL(1) among the untreated group. Unemployment rate was 40%. Male gender and obtaining vocational training were significant predictors of employment. It can be concluded that having a family member living with HIV and drug abusers are high risk groups for HIV acquisition. Factors responsible for progression of HIV should be further investigated.

We therefore examined the impact of HIV-1 infection and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) on JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Compared to age-matched healthy donors (n = 18), HIV-1-infected subjects (n = 18) prior to cART had significantly lower expression of toll-like receptors (TLR- 1/4/6/7/8/9), the IFN regulatory factors (IRF-3/7/9), and the antiviral factors (OAS-1, MxA, A3G, PKR, and Tetherin). Three months' cART partially restores the impaired functions of JAK-STAT-mediated antiviral immunity. We also found most factors had significantly positive correlations (p < 0.05) between each two factors in JAK-STAT pathway in healthy donors (98.25%, 168/171), but such significant positive associations were only found in small part of HIV-1-infected subjects (43.86%, 75/171), and stably increased during the cART (57.31%, 98/171 after 6 months' cART). With regard to the restoration of some HIV-1 restriction factors, HIV-1-infected subjects who had CD4+ T cell counts > 350//l responded better to cART than those with the counts < 350/l. These findings indicate that the impairment of JAK-STAT pathway may play a role in the immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 disease.;https://www.oncotarget.com/lookup/doi/10.18632/oncotarget.15121;4.9;7.1;9.2;;;;

Methods: Children  12 years switching to second-line ART containing a protease inhibitor (PI) in Uganda were followed for 24 months. Viral load (VL) was determined at switch to second-line and every 6 months thereafter; genotypic resistance testing was done if VL  1000 cps/ml. Results: 60 children were included in the analysis; all had  1 drug resistance mutations at switch. Twelve children (20.0%) experienced treatment failure; no PI mutations were detected. Sub-optimal adherence and underweight were associated with treatment failureConclusions: No PI mutations occurred in children failing second-line ART, which is reassuring as pediatric third-line is not routinely available in these settings. Poor adherence rather than HIV drug resistance is likely to be the main mechanism for treatment failure and should receive close attention in children on second-line ART.";None;1.9;2.0;1.7;01426338;;;

All Rights Reserved.The integrase inhibitors elvitegravir (EVG) and dolutegravir (DTG) rapidly decrease the plasma HIV-1 viral load, a key factor in the prevention of maternal-Tofetal transmission of HIV-1. No data have been reported on the concentrations of these drugs in cord blood, maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), or placental tissue in pregnant women. We present in vivo pharmacokinetic data on antiretrovirals (ARV) within maternal and cord blood and within placentae from HIV-1- infected pregnant women. Maternal blood and cord blood were obtained from women receiving EVG, cobicistat, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and emtricitabine as a single fixed-dose combination formulation or DTG as part of a combination regimen. Plasma and PBMCs from maternal and cord blood were obtained along with villous placental samples. Drug concentrations were simultaneously determined by liquid chromatography-Tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Utilizing medians and ranges to interpret our data, we compared the drug concentration ratios between different matrices (maternal and cord blood plasma, PBMCs, and placenta). All five agents transferred from maternal into fetal circulation via the placenta. Concentration ratios for EVG, cobicistat, tenofovir, and emtricitabine (n 10) and DTG (n 3) were determined between cord plasma and placenta, cord and maternal plasma, and cord PBMCs and maternal PBMCs. TFV moves from maternal plasma through the placenta to the cord blood and then into cord PBMCs, where it is phosphorylated into its active forms (TFV diphosphate). These five ARVs were detected in each of the compartments, highlighting transfer of these agents from the maternal into the fetal circulation.;https://AAC.asm.org/lookup/doi/10.1128/AAC.02213-16;7.8;7.9;8.3;00664804;e02213-16;;

Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.Background: HIV-1 drug resistance can be measured with phenotypic drug-resistance tests. However, the output of these tests, the resistance factor (RF), requires interpretation with respect to the in vivo activity of the tested variant. Specifically, the dynamic range of the RF for each drug has to be divided into a suitable number of clinically meaningful intervals. Methods: We calculated a susceptible-to-intermediate and an intermediate-to-resistant cutoff per drug for RFs predicted by geno2pheno[resistance]. Probability densities for therapeutic success and failure were estimated from 10,444 treatment episodes. The density estimation procedure corrects for the activity of the backbone drug compounds and for therapy failure without drug resistance. For estimating the probability of therapeutic success given an RF, we fit a sigmoid function. The cutoffs are given by the roots of the third derivative of the sigmoid function. Results: For performance assessment, we used geno2pheno[resistance] RF predictions and the cutoffs for predicting therapeutic success in 2 independent sets of therapy episodes. HIVdb was used for performance comparison. On one test set (n = 807), our cutoffs and HIVdb performed equally well receiver operating characteristic curve [(ROC)-area under the curve (AUC): 0.68]. On the other test set (n = 917), our cutoffs (ROC-AUC: 0.63) and HIVdb (ROC-AUC: 0.65) performed comparatively well. Conclusions: Our method can be used for calculating clinically relevant cutoffs for (predicted) RFs. The method corrects for the activity of the backbone drug compounds and for therapy failure without drug resistance. Our method's performance is comparable with that of HIVdb. RF cutoffs for the latest version of geno2pheno[resistance] have been estimated with this method.;http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201704150-00013;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

However an increasing rate of ART failure with resistant virus is reported. We therefore described the pattern of drug resistance mutations at antiretroviral treatment (ART) failure in a real-life Tanzanian setting using the remote genotyping procedure and thereafter predicted future treatment options using rule-based algorithm and the EuResist bioinformatics predictive engine. According to national guidelines, the default first-line regimen is tenofovir + lamivudine + efavirenz, but variations including nevirapine, stavudine or emtricitabine can be considered. If failure on first-line ART occurs, a combination of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and boosted lopinavir or atazanavir is recommended. Materials and methods: Plasma was obtained from subjects with first (n = 174) or second-line (n = 99) treatment failure, as defined by clinical or immunological criteria, as well as from a control group of ART naïve subjects (n = 17) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Amplification of the pol region was performed locally and the amplified DNA fragment was sent to Sweden for sequencing (split genotyping procedure). The therapeutic options after failure were assessed by the genotypic sensitivity score and the EuResist predictive engine. Viral load was quantified in a subset of subjects with second-line failure (n = 52). Results: The HIV-1 pol region was successfully amplified from 55/174 (32%) and 28/99 (28%) subjects with first- or second-line failure, respectively, and 14/17 (82%) ART-naïve individuals. HIV-1 pol sequence was obtained in 82 of these 97 cases (84.5%). Undetectable or very low (<2.6 log10 copies/10-3 L) viral load explained 19 out of 25 (76%) amplification failures in subjects at second-line ART failure. At first and second line failure, extensive accumulation of NRTI (88% and 73%, respectively) and NNRTI (93% and 73%, respectively) DRMs but a limited number of PI DRMs (11% at second line failure) was observed. First line failure subjects displayed a high degree of cross-resistance to second-generation NNRTIs etravirine (ETR; 51% intermediate and 9% resistant) and rilpivirine (RPV; 12% intermediate and 58% resistant), and to abacavir (ABC; 49% resistant) which is reserved for second line therapy in Tanzania. The predicted probability of success with the best salvage regimen at second-line failure decreased from 93.9% to 78.7% when restricting access to the NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs currently available in Tanzania compared to when including all approved drugs. Discussion: The split genotyping procedure is potential tool to analyse drug resistance in Tanzania but the sensitivity should be evaluated further. The lack of viral load monitoring likely results in a high false positive rate of treatment failures, unnecessary therapy switches and massive accumulation of NRTI and NNRTI mutations. The introduction of regular virological monitoring should be prioritized and integrated with drug resistance studies in resource limited settings.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0178942;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0178942;;

Methods: We describe a prospective cHL cohort in Malawi enrolled from 2013 to 2015. Patients received standardized treatment and evaluation, including HIV status and EBV testing of tumors and plasma. Results: Among 31 patients with confirmed cHL, the median age was 19 years (range, 2–51 years) and 22 (71%) were male. Sixteen patients (52%) had stage III/IV, 25 (81%) B symptoms, and 16 (52%) performance status impairment. Twenty-three patients (74%) had symptoms >6 months, and 11 of 29 (38%) had received empiric antituberculosis treatment. Anemia was common with median hemoglobin 8.2 g/dL (range, 3.1-17.1 g/dL), which improved during treatment. No children and 5 of 15 adults (33%) were HIV+. All HIV+ patients were on antiretroviral therapy for a median 15 months (range, 2–137 months), with median CD4 count 138 cells/L (range, 23–329 cells/L) and four (80%) having undetectable HIV. EBV was present in 18 of 24 (75%) tumor specimens, including 14 of 20 (70%) HIV and 4 of 4 (100%) HIV+. Baseline plasma EBV DNA was detected in 25 of 28 (89%) patients, with median viral load 4.7 (range, 2.0–6.7) log10copies/mL, and subsequently declined in most patients. At 12 months, overall survival was 75% (95% confidence interval [CI], 55%–88%) and progression-free survival 65% (95% CI, 42%–81%). Baseline plasma EBV DNA and persistent viremia during treatment were associated with poorer outcomes. Conclusion: cHL in Malawi is characterized by delayed diagnosis and advanced disease. Most cases were EBV associated and one-third of adults were HIV+. Despite resource limitations, 12-month outcomes were good.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/pbc.26302;4.6;4.5;4.2;15455009;e26302;;

Therefore, surveys are required to monitor resistance profiles in patients failing ART. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted amongst patients failing NNRTI-based regimens in the public sector throughout South Africa. Virological failure was defined as two consecutive HIV-1 viral load results > 1000 RNA copies/mL. Pol sequences were obtained using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing and submitted to Stanford HIVdb v7.0.1. Results: A total of 788 sequences were available for analysis. Most patients failed a tenofovir-based NRTI backbone (74.4%) in combination with efavirenz (82.1%) after median treatment duration of 36 months. K103N (48.9%) and V106M (34.9%) were the most common NNRTI mutations. Only one-third of patients retained full susceptibility to second-generation NNRTIs such as etravirine (36.5%) and rilpivirine (27.3%). After M184V/I (82.7%), K65R was the most common NRTI mutation (45.8%). The prevalence of K65R increased to 57.5% in patients failing a tenofovir regimen without prior stavudine exposure. Cross-resistance to NRTIs was often observed, but did not seem to affect the predicted activity of zidovudine as 82.9% of patients remained fully susceptible to this drug. Conclusions: The introduction of tenofovir-based first-line regimens has dramatically increased the prevalence of K65R mutations in the HIV-1-infected South African population. However, most patients failing tenofovir-based regimens remained fully susceptible to zidovudine. Based on these data, there is currently no need to change either the recommended first- or second-line ART regimens in South Africa.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dkw358;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

Previous reports suggest a transitory inhibition of the HIV-1 viral load, as well as a benign clinical progression of dengue. The follow-up of six HIV-1-infected patients, diagnosed and hospitalized with dengue virus infection in the State of Colima, Mexico, was carried out to analyze the progression of this viral coinfection. The presence of dengue virus serotype 1 was confirmed through molecular tests. No severe complications were observed in any of the patients during dengue virus infection. Significant alteration of the HIV-1 viral loads was not observed during dengue virus infection and 6 months after coinfection. Further studies are required to understand the pathology, as well as the clinical course, of these viral coinfections.;http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.17-0121;4.2;4.2;4.0;00029637;;;

Methods: All patients in the Collaboration of Observational HIV Epidemiological Research Europe (COHERE) cohort who were aged  18 years and started cART for the first time between 1 January 2005 and 1 January 2010 and who had at least one available measurement of CD4 count and a viral load  50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL at 6 months (± 3 months) after cART initiation were included in the study. Unadjusted and adjusted references curves and predictions were obtained using quantile regressions. Results: A total of 28 992 patients were included in the study. The median CD4 T-cell count at treatment initiation was 249 [interquartile range (IQR) 150, 336] cells/L. The median observed CD4 counts at 6, 9 and 12 months were 382 (IQR 256, 515), 402 (IQR 274, 543) and 420 (IQR 293, 565) cells/L. The two main factors explaining the variation of CD4 count at 6 months were AIDS stage and CD4 count at cART initiation. A CD4 count increase of  100 cells/mL is generally required in order that patients stay ‘on track’ (i.e. with a CD4 count at the same percentile as when they started), with slightly higher gains required for those starting with CD4 counts in the higher percentiles. Individual predictions adjusted for factors influencing CD4 count were more precise. Conclusions: Reference curves aid the evaluation of the immune response early after antiretroviral therapy initiation that leads to viral control.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/hiv.12389;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;

Twenty-five antiretroviral-dispensing sites throughout the country were randomly chosen to enrol at least 330 persons starting ART, to generate a point prevalence estimate of resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) with a 5% CI (for the total population and for those without antiretroviral exposure). All consecutive patients older than 18 years starting or restarting ART in the chosen clinics were eligible. Samples were processed with Trugene and analysed using the Stanford algorithm. Results: Between August 2014 and March 2015, we obtained 330 samples from people starting ART. The mean±SD age was 35±11 years, 63.4% were male, 16.6% had prior antiretroviral exposure and the median (IQR) CD4 count was 275 cells/mm3 (106-461). The prevalence of RAMs found was 14% (±4%) for the whole population (3% NRTI-RAMs; 11% NNRTI-RAMs and 2%PI-RAMs) and 13% (+4%) for those without prior antiretroviral exposure (3%, 10% and 2%, respectively). The most common mutation was K103N. Conclusions: This surveillance study showed concerning levels of HIV drug resistance in Argentina, especially to NNRTIs. Due to this finding, Argentina's Ministry of Health guidelines will change, recommending performing a resistance test for everyone before starting ART. If this is taken up properly, it also might function as a continuing surveillance tool.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dkw445;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

All rights reserved.Background: Efavirenz is currently suggested as an alternative to recommended antiretroviral (ARV) regimens by the Department of Health and Human Services for the treatment of HIV-1 in ARVnaive patients. A mid-dosing interval therapeutic range between 1000 and 4000 ng/mL for efavirenz has been proposed in the literature, with patients more likely to experience virologic failure below this range and adverse effects above. The current study reports an analysis of virologic outcome between those above, below, or within the reported efavirenz therapeutic range (1000-4000 ng/mL) and within subgroups. Methods: This analysis examined efavirenz plasma concentrations obtained from participants enrolled in AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study A5202. This investigation divided subjects into those who experienced virologic failure and those who did not. These subjects were further separated to investigate those who had ""high, "" ""within, "" or ""low"" plasma concentrations, based on the therapeutic range. The association between virologic failure and plasma concentration was statistically examined in addition to the variables: race/ethnicity, sex, assigned nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone, age at study entry, history of intravenous drug use, weight, and screening HIV-1 RNA stratification level. Results: In univariate analyses, a statistically significant difference was found when comparing the efavirenz concentration groups, (22 failures among the ""low"" concentration group [19%], 65 failures among the ""within"" concentration group [12%], and 11 failures among the ""high"" concentration group [9%]) when evaluating virologic failure as an outcome (P = 0.04). In addition, the proportion of participants with virologic failure differed across race/ethnicity groups (P = 0.03) with black non-Hispanic participants observed to have the highest rate (17%). Efavirenz concentration group, race/ethnicity, age, weight, and the interaction between efavirenz concentration group and weight were found to be significantly associated with virologic failure in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: The proposed efavirenz therapeutic range, combined with the impact of a patient's weight, is associated with virologic failure in HIV-infected ARV-naive individuals in the United States. Additional analysis is recommended to determine the most appropriate concentration value that defines the lower limit of the efavirenz therapeutic range.";http://journals.lww.com/00007691-201712000-00004;4.3;3.9;4.0;01634356;;;

Three such compounds are currently available, raltegravir, elvitegravir, dolutegravir and two more under development, bictegravir and cabotegravir. These compounds share the same mode of action but exhibit different pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic properties, and drug-drug interactions. A series of studies in the past decade have established their efficacy compared to previous regimens, both in treatment-naïve and experienced patients. INSTIs have demonstrated a favorable safety profile with fewer adverse events and low rates of virological failure. Emergence of resistance to these agents, however, is a worrying concern, particularly for elvitegravir and raltegravir that display a lower genetic barrier than dolutegravir. On-going trials aim at establishing INSTIs as part of dual-drug HIV treatments or even monotherapy. New long-acting, injectable formulations are under investigation for treatment or prevention.;http://www.eurekaselect.com/151193/article;5.8;5.3;5.1;13816128;;;

Increased adipose tissue mass affects the pharmacokinetics of numerous drugs, but few data are available for antiretroviral drugs. Objectives: In this study we aimed to explore the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral drugs and the immunovirological response in obese patients with HIV infection. Patients and methods: We examined data from 2009 to 2012 in our hospital's database for HIV-1-infected patients who received an antiretroviral drug (abacavir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir, efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine, atazanavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir or raltegravir). Obese patients were defined as those with BMI 30 kg/m2 and normal-weight patients as those with BMI 19-25 kg/m2. Plasma concentrations (C12/24) were compared for each antiretroviral drug using a Mann-Whitney test. Suboptimal dosing and virological outcome were assessed by logistic regression, adjusting on covariates. Results: We enrolled 291 obese and 196 normal-weight patients. Among the 12 analysed antiretroviral drugs, tenofovir, efavirenz and lopinavir C12 values were significantly lower in obese than normal-weight patients: 66 versus 86 ng/mL, 1498 versus 2034 ng/mL and 4595 versus 6420 ng/mL, respectively (P < 0.001). Antiretroviral drug C12/24 values weremore frequently below efficacy thresholds for obese than for normal-weight patients after adjustment for other covariates (P < 0.001). Although obese patients showed a higher CD4 count than normalweight patients (510 versus 444 cells/mm3, P < 0.001), the groups did not differ in virological failure rate. Conclusions: This study highlights the impact of obesity on antiretroviral drug plasma exposure, but identifies no consequence of this suboptimal exposure on the immuno-virological control in this population.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dkw527;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

Once-daily administration of emtricitabine/tenofovir DF was effective in preventing HIV-1 infection in clinical trials in high-risk populations, including men who have sex with men, heterosexual HIV-1-serodiscordant couples, and heterosexual men and women. As adherence to the regimen correlates with the risk of HIV-1 infection, it is important that patient adhere to pre-exposure prophylaxis.

HIV has become a chronic disease, and many men with HIV desire children. The disease itself has profound negative effects on semen quality, as does infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), so treatment with antivirals generally improves semen quality in men with longer duration of infection and/or greater symptoms. Several changes in medical practice have allowed studies of pharmacopathology of antiviral medications and brought focus on medication effects in asymptomatic men: (1) the successful practice of specialized sperm washing of asymptomatic men with HIV infection for insemination of their HIV-negative partner; (2) the recommendation that men begin anti-retroviral treatment before HIV symptoms appear; and (3) the recommendation that men without HIV infection who have HIV-seropositive partners take HIV prophylaxis. Early cases of HIV infection were generally treated by monotherapy with the nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) zidovudine (AZT). Currently, men with HIV infections take combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART), involving three or more medications, making it difficult to assess the toxicity of individual medications. In general, zidovudine alone or cART have minimal negative effects on semen quality; the most common being decreased rapid swimming of motile sperm. We review studies with other outcomes and animal studies in this chapter. Peginterferon-, which is utilized together with ribavirin to treat HCV, does appear to decrease testosterone levels and semen quality although studies showing these effects have been small. Antiviral medications used to treat viral infections other than HIV and HCV have received little experimental attention for male reproductive effects, even in experimental species.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-69535-8_11;2.6;2.5;3.0;00652598;;;

The infection is characterized by the deterioration in the immune function leading to opportunistic infections and malignancies. Additionally, there is an associated immune dysfunction characterized by a persistent inflammatory state and unhealthy elaboration of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The CD4+ T cell count has been used as a surrogate for the level of immune dysfunction that exists in patients with HIV infection. Eighty-eight (88) patients with HIV infection, forty-four (44) of whom were treatment naïve patients and forty-four (44) who were treatment-experienced patients, were recruited. The serum concentrations of cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 were carried out using R&D human Quantikine ELISA kits, while patients' CD4+ T cell counts were evaluated using the Partec easy count kit. The serum IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations were significantly higher among the AR-naïve participants compared to the ART-experienced group. Additionally, the IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations were higher in patients with lower CD4+ T cell count compared to those with higher cell counts though this was not statistically significant. Also, both IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations were higher in patients with higher WHO clinical staging of disease, significantly so for IL-6.;https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jir/2017/4128398/;6.1;5.3;5.1;23148861;4128398;;

Design: A cross-sectional study of two groups of HIV-infected participants at baseline and follow-up timepoints. Methods: AHI (n=33) and CHI (n=34) participants underwent CSF and blood sampling before treatment initiation with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and at follow-up on cART in a subset of these individuals [6 months in AHI participants (n=24), 1 year in CHI participants (n-10)]. Measured parameters were analyzed at each timepoint. Analyses employed Mann-Whitney tests and Spearman correlations. Results: Baseline median YKL-40 was higher in CHI than AHI (96844 versus 80754 ng/ l; P=0.011). Elevations in the CHI group relative to the AHI group persisted at follow-up despite treatment (87414 versus 66130 ng/l; P=0.003).

Xinjiang is a high tuberculosis and HIV prevalence area in China. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and cure rate of tuberculosis among HIV positive patients in Xinjiang. Methods: In a retrospective study between 2006 and 2011, clinical and laboratory data on 333 patients with HIV and tuberculosis were compared to 2668 patients with HIV only. There were 31 HIV positive patients with no data on tuberculosis. Results: The prevalence of tuberculosis co-infection among the HIV positive patients was 11% (95% CI 10-12%), significantly higher than the national figure in China of 2%. In most cases HIV was diagnosed late, with advanced immunodeficiency. The use of isoniazid preventive therapy was only 57.9% in patients without tuberculosis who fulfilled the criteria for receiving this prevention. The cure rate one year after diagnosis was 69.2%, which was lower than the officially reported 91.4% in all tuberculosis cases in Xinjiang in 2011. The hazard of not surviving over the five years was significantly higher in patients with HIV + tuberculosis compared to HIV only after adjusting for sex and Intravenous drug use with HR = 1.84 (95% CI 1.43-2.35; p < 0.0001). Conclusions: The prevalence of tuberculosis among HIV positive patients in Xinjiang was higher than in China taken as a whole, and HIV was diagnosed late, with underuse of isoniazid preventive therapy. The low cure rate and reduced survival can be due to late diagnosis of HIV and no testing for antibiotic resistance, together with insufficient control of adherence to the treatment regimens for tuberculosis and HIV.";http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-016-2152-4;4.5;4.3;4.1;;15;;

From a population-based household survey conducted between September and November 2012 in rural western Kenya, we retrospectively assessed HIV-1 TDR baseline rates, its determinants, and genetic diversity among drug-naïve persons aged 15-59 years with acute HIV-1 infections (AHI) and recent HIV-1 infections (RHI) as determined by nucleic acid amplification test and both Limiting Antigen and BioRad avidity immunoassays, respectively. HIV-1 pol sequences were scored for drug resistance mutations using Stanford HIVdb and WHO 2009 mutation guidelines. HIV-1 subtyping was computed in MEGA6. Eighty seven (93.5%) of the eligible samples were successfully sequenced. Of these, 8 had at least one TDR mutation, resulting in a TDR prevalence of 9.2% (95% CI 4.7-17.1). No TDR was observed among persons with AHI (n = 7). TDR prevalence was 4.6% (95% CI1.8-11.2) for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 6.9% (95% CI 3.2-14.2) for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and 1.2% (95% CI 0.2-6.2) for protease inhibitors. Three (3.4% 95% CI 0.8-10.1) persons had dual-class NRTI/NNRTI resistance. Predominant TDR mutations in the reverse transcriptase included K103N/S (4.6%) and M184V (2.3%); only M46I/L (1.1%) occurred in the protease. All the eight persons were predicted to have different grades of resistance to the ARV regimens, ranging from potential low-level to high-level resistance. HIV-1 subtype distribution was heterogeneous: A (57.5%), C (6.9%), D (21.8%), G (2.3%), and circulating recombinant forms (11.5%). Only low CD4 count was associated with TDR (p = 0.0145). Our findings warrant the need for enhanced HIV-1 TDR monitoring in order to inform on population-based therapeutic guidelines and public health interventions.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0171124;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0171124;;

The aim of our study was to assess the effect of rosuvastatin on D-dimer and other serum inflammation markers among these subjects. Methods: Prospective, cohort study of HIV-1-infected adult patients receiving a stable combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), who started a lipid-lowering therapy with rosuvastatin (10 mg daily) and were followed up for at least 12 months. The primary endpoint was the change at month 12 in the median plasma concentration of D-dimer. The secondary endpoints included the variation in median plasma levels of these inflammatory biomarkers: interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and interleukin-12 (IL-12). Results: Sixty-two patients were enrolled in the study, and the endpoints were available for 54 subjects. After 12 months, a significant decrease in median plasma concentration of D-dimer was observed (-21.4%; interquartile range [IQR], -35.5; -4.2; p = .029). With regard to the inflammatory biomarkers, a significant decrease in median levels of IL-8 (-24.6%; IQR, -30.8; -1.8; p = .012) and IL-12 (-18.7%; IQR, -25.8; +2.5; p = .033) was also observed. Rosuvastatin led to a significant reduction in serum lipid values and showed a good tolerability profile. Conclusions: Our findings show that a 12-month treatment with rosuvastatin associated with an effective cART can significantly decrease the plasma levels of D-dimer, IL-8, and IL-12, and suggest a potential role for this statin to reduce activated coagulation and systemic inflammation among HIV-infected persons.";http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2016.0134;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

Methods: Blood samples were collected from 122 newly diagnosed drug-naïve HIV-1-positive individuals and 229 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-failure individuals from 11 prefectures in Hebei Province, China. Patient demographic data were obtained via face-to-face interviews using a standardized questionnaire when blood samples were collected. Genotyping of HIV-1 drug resistance (DR) was implemented using an in-house assay. Results: In this study, the overall prevalence of HIV-1 DR was 35.5%. The prevalence of HIV-1 DR in participants experiencing treatment failure and ART-naïve participants was 51.9 and 5.9%, respectively. Mutations in protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and non-NRTI (NNRTIs), as well as dual and multiple mutations were extensively seen in participants experiencing treatment failure. The proportions of NNRTI mutations (2=9.689, p=0.002) and dual mutations in NRTIs and NNRTIs (2=39.958, p<0.001) in participants experiencing treatment failure were significantly higher than those in ART-naïve participants. The distributions of M184V/I and M41L mutations differed significantly among three main HIV-1 genotypes identified. Viral load, symptoms in the past 3months, CD4 counts, transmission route, and the duration of ART were found to be associated with HIV-1 DR. Conclusions: Our results suggest that new prevention and control strategies should be formulated according to the epidemic characteristics of HIV-1-resistant strains in Hebei Province, where antiretroviral drugs are widely used.;http://aidsrestherapy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12981-017-0133-3;3.2;3.8;4.4;;4;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The central nervous system (CNS) is a very challenging HIV-1 sanctuary, in which HIV-1 replication is established early on during acute infection and can persist despite potent antiretroviral treatments. HIV-1 infected macrophages play a pivotal role acting as vehicles for HIV-1 to spread into the brain, and can be the major contributor of an early compartmentalization. HIV-1 infection in CNS may lead to a broad spectrum of neurological syndromes, such as dementia, mild neurocognitive disorders, and asymptomatic impairment. These clinical manifestations are caused by the release of neurotoxins from infected cells (mainly macrophages), and also by several HIV-1 proteins, able to activate cell-signaling involved in the control of cellular survival and apoptosis. This review is aimed at highlighting the virological aspects associated with the onset of neurocognitive disorders and at addressing the novel therapeutic approaches to stop HIV-1 replication in this critical sanctuary.;http://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/7/4/38;1.9;2.4;3.3;;38;;

The aim of this study was to assess if HIV subtype differences were associated with variations in glycosylation patterns and co-receptor tropism among HAART patients experiencing different virologic treatment outcomes. Methods: A total of 118 HIV env C2V3 sequence isolates generated previously from 59 Kenyan patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were examined for tropism and glycosylation patterns. For analysis of Potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGs), amino acid sequences generated by the NCBI’s Translate tool were applied to the HIVAlign and the N-glycosite tool within the Los Alamos Database. Viral tropism was assessed using Geno2Pheno (G2P), WebPSSM and Phenoseq platforms as well as using Raymond’s and Esbjörnsson’s rules. Chi square test was used to determine independent variables association and ANOVA applied on scale variables. Results: At respective False Positive Rate (FPR) cut-offs of 5% (p = 0.045), 10% (p = 0.016) and 20% (p = 0.005) for CXCR4 usage within the Geno2Pheno platform, HIV-1 subtype and viral tropism were significantly associated in a chi square test. Raymond’s rule (p = 0.024) and WebPSSM (p = 0.05), but not Phenoseq or Esbjörnsson showed significant associations between subtype and tropism. Relative to other platforms used, Raymond’s and Esbjörnsson’s rules showed higher proportions of X4 variants, while WebPSSM resulted in lower proportions of X4 variants across subtypes. The mean glycosylation density differed significantly between subtypes at positions, N277 (p = 0.034), N296 (p = 0.036), N302 (p = 0.034) and N366 (p = 0.004), with HIV-1D most heavily glycosylated of the subtypes. R5 isolates had fewer PNGs than X4 isolates, but these differences were not significant except at position N262 (p = 0.040). Cell-associated isolates from virologic treatment success subjects were more glycosylated than cell-free isolates from virologic treatment failures both for the NXT (p = 0.016), and for all the patterns (p = 0.011). Conclusion: These data reveal significant associations of HIV-1 subtype diversity, viral co-receptor tropism, viral suppression and envelope glycosylation. These associations have important implications for designing therapy and vaccines against HIV. Heavy glycosylation and preference for CXCR4 usage of HIV-1D may explain rapid disease progression in patients infected with these strains.;http://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12985-017-0703-y;4.0;4.2;4.5;;29;;

However, it is difficult to accurately estimate theT1/2 of HIV-1 infected T cells due to possible clonal proliferation: i.e., the listed T1/2 describes the duration of the HIV-1 reservoir itself, but does not directly address the T1/2 of the cell that harbors the reservoir b In the described experiments, donor alveolar macrophages were found 2-3 years after lung transplantation in human subjects: while we assume that these TRM persisted for this duration, it is possible that they underwent proliferation and replacement locally c The indicated longevity is for the infectious virions that were found on FDC dendrites, although it is controversial whether this cell type was actually infected.;http://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12977-017-0333-x;7.3;6.7;6.7;;11;;

The Swedish database InfCareHIV includes high quality data from more than 99% of all patients diagnosed with HIV infection in Sweden and provides a unique opportunity to examine outcomes in a nationwide real world cohort. Methods Adult patients who started a new therapy defined as a new 3rd agent (all antiretrovirals that are not N[t]RTIs) 2009-2014 with more than 100 observations in treatment-naive or treatment- experienced patients were included. Dolutegravir was excluded due to short follow up period. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios for treatment discontinuation. Results In treatment-naïve 2541 patients started 2583 episodes of treatments with a 3rd agent. Efavirenz was most commonly used (n = 1096) followed by darunavir (n = 504), atazanavir (n = 386), lopinavir (n = 292), rilpivirine (n = 156) and raltegravir (n = 149). In comparison with efavirenz, patients on rilpivirine were least likely to discontinue treatment (adjusted HR 0.33; 95% CI 0.20-0.54, p<0.001), while patients on lopinavir were most likely to discontinue treatment (adjusted HR 2.80; 95% CI 2.30-3.40, p<0.001). Also raltegravir was associated with early treatment discontinuation (adjusted HR 1.47; 95% CI 1.12-1.92, p = 0.005). The adjusted HR for atazanavir and darunavir were not significantly different from efavirenz. In treatment-experienced 2991 patients started 4552 episodes of treatments with a 3rd agent. Darunavir was most commonly used (n = 1285), followed by atazanavir (n = 806), efavirenz (n = 694), raltegravir (n = 622), rilpivirine (n = 592), lopinavir (n = 291) and etravirine (n = 262). Compared to darunavir all other drugs except for rilpivirine (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52- 0.83, p<0.001) had higher risk for discontinuation in the multivariate adjusted analyses; atazanavir (HR 1.71; 95% CI 1.48-1.97, p<0.001), efavirenz (HR 1.86; 95% CI 1.59-2.17, p<0.001), raltegravir (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.15-1.58, p<0.001), lopinavir (HR 3.58; 95% CI 3.02-4.25, p<0.001) and etravirine (HR 1.61; 95% CI 1.31-1.98, p<0.001).Besides the 3rd agent chosen also certain baseline characteristics of patients were independently associated with differences in treatment duration. In naive patients, presence of an AIDS-defining diagnosis and the use of other backbone than TDF/FTC or ABC/3TC increased the risk for early treatment discontinuation. In treatment-experienced patients, detectable plasma viral load at the time of switch or being highly treatment experienced increased the risk for early treatment discontinuation. Conclusions Treatment durability is dependent on several factors among others patient characteristics and ART guidelines. The choice of 3rd agent has a strong impact and significant differences between different drugs on treatment duration exist.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0171227;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0171227;;

A total of 101 patients attaining first-line treatment failure (FTF) were followed until second-line treatment failure (STF) to study the rate of accumulation of thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs), their future drug options, and genetic evolution. The result shows that predominant nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutations were M184V/I (87.3% in FTF and 79% in STF) followed by TAMs (53.4% in FTF and 54.5% in STF). The rate of accumulation of TAMs was higher for a patient with TAMI [0.015 TAM per person-month (TPPM)], TAMII (0.042 TPPM), and 1 (0.005 TPPM) or 2 TAMs (0.008 TPPM) compared with a patient with both TAMs and 3 or >3 TAMs. Future ART options show that >50% of the patients can be considered for choices to recycle NRTIs in the second-line, and third-line therapy. We conclude that the patients who initiated thymidine analogue-based first-line before 2010 can be very well opted for AZT- and TDF-based second-line regimen in the future.;http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2016.0070;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

Patients were monitored clinically and biologically for HIV-1 RNA load and drug resistance mutations (DRMs) genotyping. A total of 87 (40%) study children were virological responders and 133 (60%) nonresponders. In children with detectable viral load, the majority (129; 97%) represented a virological failure. In children receiving 1st-line regimens in virological failure for whom genotypic resistance test was available, 45% displayed viruses harboring at least 1 DRM to NNRTI or NRTI, and 26% showed at least 1 major DRM to NNRTI or NRTI; more than half of children in 1st-line regimens were resistant to 1st-generation NNRTI and 24% of the children in 1st-line regimens had a major DRMs to PI. Virological failure and selection of DRMs were both associated with poor adherence. These observations demonstrate high rate of virological failure after 3 to 5 years of 1st-line or 2nd-line antiretroviral treatment, which is generally associated with DRMs and therapeutic failure. Overall, more than half (55%) of children receiving 1st-line antiretroviral treatment for a median of 3.4 years showed virological failure and antiretroviral-resistance and thus eligible to 2nd-line treatment. Furthermore, two-third (64%) of children under 2nd-line therapy were eligible to 3rd-line regimen.

Given their short plasma half-lives, such an effect may be transient and only apparent during ongoing exposure. Methods: We studied all HIV infected US-Veterans who started HAART 1995-2011, had a documented HIV viral load (VL) >1000 copies/mL, reached an undetectable VL on HAART, and had 1 follow-up VL within 13 months. We defined virologic failure (VF) as the first VL <1,000 copies/mL or the first of 2 consecutive VL >200 copies/mL. We built a time-updated drug exposure model for antiretrovirals (ARVs), statins, and other cardiovascular drugs (CVMs), investigating current use (yes/no), recent use (proportion of days used), and categorical use (ever/never). We used both multiply adjusted and inverse-probability-weighted (IPW) Cox models to explore the association between statin and CVM use and VF. Results: 19,324 veterans met inclusion criteria. Median follow-up was 13 months (IQR: 5-32 months); 63% experienced VF after a median time of 9 months (IQR 4-21 months). Almost 1/3 patients ever used statins but exposure comprised only 41% of follow-up time covered after initial prescription. Unadjusted, current statin use was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) for VF of 0.60 (CI: 0.56-0.65). This remained statistically significant after multivariate adjustment (MVA) for demographics, HIV and HAART parameters [HR 0.81 (CI: 0.75-0.88), p<0.001] and IPW (truncation <1%/>99%) HR: 0.83 (CI: 0.75-0.92), p<0.001]. No independent association was observed for other CVMs. The association between categorical-statin use and VF after MVA was much weaker: HR 0.94 (CI: 0.88-1.00, p = 0.04). Conclusion: Current statin exposure was associated with reduced risk of VF in univariate, multivariate, and inverse-probability-weighted models. Our results highlight the importance of time-updated medication exposure models for observational studies.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0172175;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0172175;;

Methods: Resistance testing was conducted in 6704 ART-naive subjects predominantly from the United States and Europe in 9 clinical studies conducted by Gilead Sciences from 2000 to 2013. Results: The presence of TDRMs increased during this period (from 5.2% to 11.4%), primarily driven by an increase in nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance mutations (from 0.3% to 7.1%), particularly K103N/S (increase from 0.3% to 5.3%). Nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitor mutations were found in 3.1% of patients. Only 1 patient had K65R (0.01%) and 7 had M184V/I (0.1%), despite high use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), emtricitabine, and lamivudine and potential transmission of resistance to these drugs. At least 1 thymidine-analogue mutations was present in 2.7% of patients with 0.07% harboring T215Y/F and 2.7% harboring T215 revertant mutations (T215rev). Patients with the combination of M41L + L210W + T215rev showed full human immunodeficiency virus RNA suppression while receiving a TDF- or tenofovir alafenamide-containing regimen. Conclusions: There was an overall increase of TDRMs among patients enrolling in clinical trials from 2000 through 2013, driven primarily by an increase in NNRTI resistance. However, the presence of common TDRMs, including thymidine-analogue mutations/T215rev, showed no impact on response to TDF- or tenofovir alafenamide-containing regimens.;https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/infdis/jix015;10.4;9.2;9.0;00221899;;;

We found that 54% and 65% of the children had genotypically predicted resistance to second-generation non-nucleoside RT inhibitors drugs Etravirine (ETR) and Rilpivirine, respectively. These cross-resistance mutations may compromise future NNRTI-based regimens, especially in resource-limited settings. To complement these investigations, we also analyzed the sequences in Stanford database, Monogram weighted score, and DUET weighted score algorithms for ETR susceptibility and found almost perfect agreement between the three algorithms in predicting ETR susceptibility from genotypic data.;http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2016.0133;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

The high local multiplicity that characterizes cell–cell infection causes variability in the effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs applied as single agents. Whereas protease inhibitors (PIs) are effective inhibitors of HIV-1 cell–cell and cell-free infection, some reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) show reduced potency; however, antiretrovirals are not administered as single agents and are used clinically as combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Here we explored the efficacy of PI- and RTI-based cART against cell–cell spread of wild-type and drug-resistant HIV-1 strains. Using a quantitative assay to measure cell–cell spread of HIV-1 between T cells, we evaluated the efficacy of different clinically relevant drug combinations. We show that combining PIs and RTIs improves the potency of inhibition of HIV-1 and effectively blocks both cell-free and cell–cell spread. Combining drugs that alone are poor inhibitors of cell–cell spread markedly improves HIV-1 inhibition, demonstrating that clinically relevant combinations of ART can inhibit this mode of HIV-1 spread. Furthermore, comparison of wild-type and drug-resistant viruses reveals that PI- and RTI-resistant viruses have a replicative advantage over wild-type virus when spreading by cell–cell means in the presence of cART, suggesting that in the context of inadequate drug combinations or drug resistance, cell–cell spread could potentially allow for ongoing viral replication.";https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jgv/10.1099/jgv.0.000728;5.2;5.5;5.9;00221317;;;

However, the full spectrum of reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations selected in individuals with VF on such a regimen is not known. To identify TDF regimen-associated mutations (TRAMs), we compared the proportion of each RT mutation in 2873 individuals with VF on a WHO-recommended first-line TDF-containing regimen to its proportion in a cohort of 50,803 antiretroviral-naïve individuals. To identify TRAMs specifically associated with TDF-selection pressure, we compared the proportion of each TRAM to its proportion in a cohort of 5805 individuals with VF on a first-line thymidine analog-containing regimen. We identified 83 TRAMs including 33 NRTI-associated, 40 NNRTI-associated, and 10 uncommon mutations of uncertain provenance. Of the 33 NRTI-associated TRAMs, 12 – A62V, K65R/N, S68G/N/D, K70E/Q/T, L74I, V75L, and Y115F – were more common among individuals receiving a first-line TDF-containing compared to a first-line thymidine analog-containing regimen. These 12 TDF-selected TRAMs will be important for monitoring TDF-associated transmitted drug-resistance and for determining the extent of reduced TDF susceptibility in individuals with VF on a TDF-containing regimen.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352396417301202;6.0;8.4;8.7;;;;

HIV and/or antiretroviral therapy (ART), particularly efavirenz (EFV), may interfere with vitamin D metabolism. However, few data from randomized, controlled trials exist. Here, we investigate changes in vitamin D metabolites and binding protein (VDBP) after 6 months of supplementation in a randomized, active-control, double-blind trial investigating 2 different monthly cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) doses [60,000 (medium) or 120,000 (high) IU/month] vs. a control arm of 18,000 IU/month in 8–25 year old HIV-infected youth on ART with HIV-1 RNA <1000 copies/mL and baseline 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D3) 30 ng/mL. A matched healthy uninfected group was enrolled in a similar parallel study for comparison. Changes after 6 months were analyzed as intent-to-treat within/between groups [control group (low dose) vs. combined supplementation doses (medium + high)]. At 6 months, 55% vs. 82% of subjects in control and supplementation groups, respectively, reached 25(OH)D3 30 ng/mL (P = 0.01) with no difference between medium and high doses (both 82% 30 ng/mL). There were few differences for those on EFV vs. no-EFV, except serum VDBP decreased in EFV-treated subjects (both within- and between-groups P  0.01). There were no significant differences between the HIV-infected vs. healthy uninfected groups. The major finding of the present study is that cholecalciferol supplementation (60,000 or 120,000 IU/month) effectively raises serum 25(OH)D3 in the majority of HIV-infected subjects, regardless of EFV use. Notably, response to supplementation was similar to that of uninfected subjects.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960076017300183;7.6;7.6;7.0;09600760;;;

Bictegravir, a novel, once-daily, unboosted INSTI, showed potent activity in a 10 day monotherapy study and has a high in-vitro resistance barrier. On the basis of these results, we did a phase 2 trial comparing bictegravir with dolutegravir. Methods In this randomised, double-blind, phase 2 trial, we recruited previously untreated adults (aged 18 years) with HIV-1 infections from 22 outpatient centres in the USA. Eligible patients had HIV-1 RNA concentrations of at least 1000 copies per mL, CD4 counts of at least 200 cells per L, estimated glomerular filtration rates of at least 70 mL per min, and HIV-1 genotypes showing sensitivity to emtricitabine and tenofovir. We excluded patients if they were hepatitis B-co-infected or hepatitis C-co-infected, had new AIDS-defining conditions within 30 days of screening, or were pregnant. We randomly allocated participants (2:1) to receive oral once-daily 75 mg bictegravir or 50 mg dolutegravir with matching placebo plus the fixed-dose combination of 200 mg emtricitabine and 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide for 48 weeks. We randomly allocated participants via an interactive web system, stratified by HIV-1 RNA concentration. Investigators, patients, study staff giving treatment, collecting data, and assessing outcomes, and the funder were masked to treatment group. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations of less than 50 copies per mL at week 24 according to the US Food and Drug Administration-defined snapshot algorithm. We included all participants receiving one dose of study drug in analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02397694. Findings Between March 23, 2015, and May 21, 2015, we screened 125 patients, randomly allocating and giving study drug to 98 (65 received bictegravir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide and 33 received dolutegravir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide). At week 24, 63 (96·9%) of 65 in the bictegravir group had HIV-1 RNA loads of less than 50 copies per mL compared with 31 (93·9%) of 33 in the dolutegravir group (weighted difference 2·9%, 95% CI 8·5 to 14·2; p=0·50). Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 55 (85%) of 65 participants in the bictegravir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide group versus 22 (67%) of 33 in the dolutegravir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide group. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea (eight [12%] of 65 vs four [12%] of 33) and nausea (five [8%] of 65 vs four [12%] of 33). One participant taking bictegravir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide discontinued because of a drug-related adverse event (urticaria) after week 24. No treatment-related serious adverse events or deaths occurred. Interpretation Bictegravir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide and dolutegravir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide both showed high efficacy up to 24 weeks. Both treatments were well tolerated. Administration of bictegravir, a novel, potent, once-daily INSTI designed to improve on existing INSTI options with the backbone of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, might provide an advantage to patients.

Although SAMHD1 is expressed and active/unphosphorylated in most cell lines, its restriction activity is thought to be relevant only in non-cycling cells. However, an in depth evaluation of SAMHD1 function and relevance in cycling cells is required. Here, we show that SAMHD1-induced degradation by HIV-2 Vpx affects the dNTP pool and HIV-1 replication capacity in the presence of the 3-azido-3-deoxythymidine (AZT) in cycling cells. Similarly, in SAMHD1 knockout cells, HIV-1 showed increased replicative capacity in the presence of nucleoside inhibitors, especially AZT, that was reverted by re-expression of wild type SAMHD1. Sensitivity to non-nucleoside inhibitors (nevirapine and efavirenz) or the integrase inhibitor raltegravir was not affected by SAMHD1. Combination of three mutations (S18A, T21A, T25A) significantly prevented SAMHD1 phosphorylation but did not significantly affect HIV-1 replication in the presence of AZT. Our results demonstrate that SAMHD1 is active in HIV-1 permissive cells, does not modify susceptibility to HIV-1 infection but strongly affects sensitivity to nucleoside inhibitors.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166354216306775;7.4;7.3;7.4;01663542;;;

We assessed whether same-day HIV testing and ART initiation improves retention and virologic suppression. Methods and findings: We conducted an unblinded, randomized trial of standard ART initiation versus same-day HIV testing and ART initiation among eligible adults 18 years old with World Health Organization Stage 1 or 2 disease and CD4 count 500 cells/mm3. The study was conducted among outpatients at the Haitian Group for the Study of Kaposi’s Sarcoma and Opportunistic infections (GHESKIO) Clinic in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to standard ART initiation or same-day HIV testing and ART initiation. The standard group initiated ART 3 weeks after HIV testing, and the same-day group initiated ART on the day of testing. The primary study endpoint was retention in care 12 months after HIV testing with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml. We assessed the impact of treatment arm with a modified intention-to-treat analysis, using multivariable logistic regression controlling for potential confounders. Between August 2013 and October 2015, 762 participants were enrolled; 59 participants transferred to other clinics during the study period, and were excluded as per protocol, leaving 356 in the standard and 347 in the same-day ART groups. In the standard ART group, 156 (44%) participants were retained in care with 12-month HIV-1 RNA <50 copies, and 184 (52%) had <1,000 copies/ml; 20 participants (6%) died. In the same-day ART group, 184 (53%) participants were retained with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml, and 212 (61%) had <1,000 copies/ml; 10 (3%) participants died. The unadjusted risk ratio (RR) of being retained at 12 months with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.38; p = 0.015) for the same-day ART group compared to the standard ART group, and the unadjusted RR for being retained with HIV-1 RNA <1,000 copies was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.31; p = 0.012). The main limitation of this study is that it was conducted at a single urban clinic, and the generalizability to other settings is uncertain. Conclusions: Same-day HIV testing and ART initiation is feasible and beneficial in this setting, as it improves retention in care with virologic suppression among patients with early clinical HIV disease.

All Rights Reserved.The kinetics of HIV-1 decay under treatment depends on the class of antiretrovirals used. Mathematical models are useful to interpret the different profiles, providing quantitative information about the kinetics of virus replication and the cell populations contributing to viral decay. We modeled proviral integration in short- and long-lived infected cells to compare viral kinetics under treatment with and without the integrase inhibitor raltegravir (RAL). We fitted the model to data obtained from participants treated with RAL-containing regimes or with a four-drug regimen of protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Our model explains the existence and quantifies the three phases of HIV-1 RNA decay in RAL-based regimens vs. the two phases observed in therapies without RAL. Our findings indicate that HIV-1 infection is mostly sustained by short-lived infected cells with fast integration and a short viral production period, and by long-lived infected cells with slow integration but an equally short viral production period. We propose that these cells represent activated and resting infected CD4+ T-cells, respectively, and estimate that infection of resting cells represent ~4% of productive reverse transcription events in chronic infection. RAL reveals the kinetics of proviral integration, showing that in short-lived cells the pre-integration population has a half-life of ~7 hours, whereas in long-lived cells this half-life is ~6 weeks. We also show that the efficacy of RAL can be estimated by the difference in viral load at the start of the second phase in protocols with and without RAL. Overall, we provide a mechanistic model of viral infection that parsimoniously explains the kinetics of viral load decline under multiple classes of antiretrovirals.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006478;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;e1006478;;

Karger AG, Basel.Objective: To evaluate the mutational patterns on the pol gene of the main HIV-1 strain archived in cell genome of 10 chronically infected men according to their clinical and therapeutic history. The genotyping resistance profiles were compared between the first blood plasma available at the time of HIV diagnosis and rectal biopsies and PBMC sampled 1-5 years after the initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Methods: HIV-1 RNA and cell-associated HIV-1 DNA were quantified by Abbott Real-Time HIV-1 and Generic HIV® DNA cell (Biocentric) assays. The mutations in protease and reverse transcriptase genes were assessed by the Trugene® assay (Siemens). The C2V3 region was amplified to determine the viral tropism. Results: In 9 patients, slight or no differences were observed between the 3 resistance profiles. Those mostly detected were related to the resistance to nucleos(t)ide (D67N, L210W, T215A, T69D) and nonnucleoside (K103N, V106I, V179I) inhibitors. In 1 rilpivirine-treated patient, the M230I mutation was detected in PBMC. No change of viral tropism was observed between samples. Conclusion: These data suggest that resistance mutations harbored by the main HIV strain in plasma at the time of diagnosis are durably archived in DNA cells whatever the delay between infection and initiation of therapy in patients well controlled by cART.;https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/472716;2.6;1.9;1.9;03005526;;;

Methods: An expert panel was created to provide recommendations for the update of the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (HIVDB) GRT-IS. The panel was polled on the ARVs to be included in a GRT report, and the drug-resistance interpretations associated with 160 drug-resistance mutation (DRM) pattern-ARV combinations. The DRM pattern-ARV combinations included 52 nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTI) DRM pattern-ARV combinations (13 patterns x 4 NRTIs), 27 nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI) DRM pattern-ARV combinations (9 patterns x 3 NNRTIs), 39 protease inhibitor (PI) DRM pattern-ARV combinations (13 patterns x 3 PIs) and 42 integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) DRM pattern-ARV combinations (14 patterns x 3 INSTIs). Results: There was universal agreement that a GRT report should include the NRTIs lamivudine, abacavir, zidovudine, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; the NNRTIs efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine, and rilpivirine; the PIs atazanavir/r, darunavir/r, and lopinavir/r (with “/r” indicating pharmacological boosting with ritonavir or cobicistat); and the INSTIs dolutegravir, elvitegravir, and raltegravir. There was a range of opinion as to whether the NRTIs stavudine and didanosine and the PIs nelfinavir, indinavir/r, saquinavir/r, fosampre-navir/r, and tipranavir/r should be included. The expert panel members provided highly concordant DRM pattern-ARV interpretations with only 6% of NRTI, 6% of NNRTI, 5% of PI, and 3% of INSTI individual expert interpretations differing from the expert panel median by more than one resistance level. The expert panel median differed from the HIVDB 7.0 GRT-IS for 20 (12.5%) of the 160 DRM pattern-ARV combinations including 12 NRTI, two NNRTI, and six INSTI pattern-ARV combinations. Eighteen of these differences were updated in HIVDB 8.1 GRT-IS to reflect the expert panel median. Additionally, HIVDB users are now provided with the option to exclude those ARVs not considered to be universally required. Conclusions: The HIVDB GRT-IS was updated through a collaborative process to reflect changes in HIV drug resistance knowledge, treatment guidelines, and expert opinion. Such a process broadens consensus among experts and identifies areas requiring further study.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181357;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0181357;;

Survival analyseswere conducted to examine the effect of second-line ART on mortality and loss to follow-up in: (i) the whole cohort;(ii) all patients eligible for second-line ART by immunological failure (IF) and/or virological failure (VF) criteria;and (iii) patients eligible by VF criteria.Results: In total, 47296 HIV-infected patients [mean age 37.5 (SD 9.5) years, CD4 175 (SD 158) cells/mm3, 71%female] were included in the analyses. Of these, 1760 (3.7%) patients switched to second-line ART (incidencerate""1.7/100 person-years). Higher rates of mortality were observed in switchers versus non-switchers in all patientsand patients with ART failure using IF/VF criteria.

Recent Findings: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces dramatically systemic inflammation and immune activation, but not to levels synchronous with HIV-uninfected populations. In one ART initiation trial, integrase inhibitors appear to reduce inflammation to a greater degree than non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs); however, it is not clear that there are beneficial effects on inflammation resulting from treatment with integrase inhibitors compared to PIs, between PIs and NNRTIs, between specific nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, or with maraviroc in ART-naïve patients. In ART switch studies, changing to an integrase inhibitor from a PI-, NNRTI-, or enfuvirtide-containing regimen has resulted in improvement in several markers of inflammation. Summary: Additional research is needed to conclusively state whether there are clear differences in effects of specific antiretrovirals on inflammation and immune activation in HIV.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11904-017-0356-x;10.3;0;6.5;15483568;;;

We explored the combination of lamivudine + dolutegravir as an option when switching from standard cART in virologically suppressed patients. Methods: In this prospective cohort we enrolled patients previously switched to 3TC + DTG who were 18 years or older, with no previous resistance mutations to the used drugs, having a HIV-RNA <50 copies/ml for 6 months or longer, negative for HBsAg and on a stable (>6 months) cART. Results: Ninety-four individuals were included. They were mostly men (77.7%) with a mean age of 53 years. They presented 159 co-morbidities including cardiovascular, bone, hepatic, kidney, and CNS diseases. Because of these pathologies, they took 207 non-ARV drugs (mean 2.2 per patient). Median duration of viral suppression was 77.5 months (IQR 61). All subjects were prospectively followed up to week 24 and all remained on dual therapy during the whole period. Neither virological failure, nor viral blip was detected. The median CD4 count rose from 658 cells/mcl (IQR 403) to 724 cells/mcl (IQR 401) (P = 0.006) without a significant (P = 0.44) change in the CD4/CD8 ratio. A significant (P < 0.0001) increment of median creatinine from 0.87 mg/dl (IQR 0.34) to 0.95 mg/dl (IQR 0.29) was observed in the first 2 months but thereafter leveled on these values (1.00 mg/dl; IQR 0.35) (P = 0.111 compared to 2 months). The lipid profile slightly improved. The daily cost of cART was significantly (P < 0.0001) reduced of 6.89 euros (SD 6.10). Discussion: Switching to a dual cART regimen based on lamivudine + dolutegravir maintains virological efficacy up to week 24, and is associated to slight improvements of the immunologic and metabolic status. The strategy allows to freely using concomitant medications for associated pathologies. The dual therapy is less expensive in economic terms. Conclusion: Although still limited evidence exists, a dolutegravir-based dual therapy in combination with lamivudine shows promising results to be confirmed in larger controlled trials.";http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2311-2;4.5;4.3;4.1;;215;;

Methods: Observational, prospective study. Study population included all treatment-experienced patients with sustained virological suppression who switched to RPV/FTC/TDF during 2013 in a tertiary hospital. Patients were followed until they completed 96 weeks of treatment. The effectiveness end-point was defined as the proportion of patients who maintained virological suppression at week 96 by intention-to-treat analysis (discontinuation=failure). The safety of RPV/FTC/TDF (incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation and laboratory abnormalities) and adherence to this regimen were evaluated, and the cost of switching was analysed. Results: One-hundred forty-six patients were included. At week 96, 71.9% of patients remained virologically suppressed; 6.8% experienced virological failure. During follow-up, 25.3% of patients discontinued RPV/FTC/TDF (14.4% because of adverse events, mainly renal impairment). Throughout the 96 weeks, there were significant decreases in total cholesterol (TC) (14.0 mg/dL, P<.001), TC/HDL cholesterol ratio (0.4 mg/dL, P=.019) and triglycerides (42.0 mg/dL, P<.001). A slight decrease in glomerular filtration rate was observed (4.3 mL/min/1.73 m2, P<.001). Switching to RPV/FTC/TDF improved adherence in the subgroup of patients whose previous treatment was based on a twice-daily schedule, although differences did not reach statistical significance. Switching to RPV/FTC/TDF reduced the annual per-patient antiretroviral cost by €1744 (P<.001). Conclusions: In virologically suppressed patients, the switch to a RPV/FTC/TDF regimen was associated with a mild but maintained improvement in lipid parameters and a significant reduction in costs. However, the relatively high rates of virological failure and treatment discontinuation because of adverse events make this combination a less favourable choice over other regimens currently available.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/ijcp.12968;4.6;4.4;4.3;13685031;e12968;;

A large population of antiretroviral-treated patients who had a VL > 1.7 log10 copies/mL in CSF with detectable or undetectable VL in plasma associated with cognitive impairment was studied, in order to characterize discriminatory factors of these two patient populations.Methods: Blood and CSF samples were collected at the time of neurological disorders for 227 patients in 22 centres in France and 1 centre in Switzerland. Genotypic HIV resistance tests were performed on CSF. The genotypic susceptibility score was calculated according to the last Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le Sida et les hépatites virales Action Coordonnée 11 (ANRS AC11) genotype interpretation algorithm.Results: Among the 227 studied patients with VL > 1.7 log10 copies/mL in CSF 195 had VL detectable in plasma [median (IQR) HIV RNA was 3.7 (2.7-4.7) log10 copies/mL] and 32 had discordant VL in plasma (VL < 1.7 log10 copies/mL). The CSF VL was lower (median 2.8 versus 4.0 log10 copies/mL; P < 0.001) and the CD4 cell count was higher (median 476 versus 214 cells/mm3; P < 0.001) in the group of patients with VL < 1.7 log10 copies/mL in plasma compared with patients with plasma VL > 1.7 log10 copies/mL. Resistance to antiretrovirals was observed in CSF for the two groups of patients.Conclusions: Fourteen percent of this population of patients with cognitive impairment and detectable VL in CSF had well controlled VL in plasma. Thus it is important to explore CSF HIV (VL and genotype) even if the HIV VL is controlled in plasma because HIV resistance may be observed.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jac/dkx128;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

In these elite controllers (ECs), multiple parameters contribute to viral suppression, including genetic factors and immune responses. Defining the immune correlates associated with the generation of bnAbs may help in designing efficient immunotherapies. In this study, in ECs either positive or negative for the HLA-B*57 protective allele, in treated HIV-infected and HIV-negative individuals, we characterized memory B cell compartments and HIV-specific memory B cells responses using flow cytometry and ELISPOT. ECs preserved their memory B cell compartments and in contrast to treated patients, maintained detectable HIV-specific memory B cell responses. All ECs presented IgG1 + HIV-specific memory B cells but some individuals also preserved IgG2 + or IgG3 + responses. Importantly, we also analyzed the capacity of sera from ECs to neutralize a panel of HIV strains including transmitted/founder virus. 29% and 21% of HLA-B*57 + and HLA-B*57  ECs, respectively, neutralized at least 40% of the viral strains tested. Remarkably, in HLA-B*57 + ECs the frequency of HIV-Env-specific memory B cells correlated positively with the neutralization breadth suggesting that preservation of HIV-specific memory B cells might contribute to the neutralizing responses in these patients.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S235239641730227X;6.0;8.4;8.7;;;;

As the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone is shared in first- and second-line regimens, accumulation of drug resistant mutations (DRMs) can compromise the efficacy of NRTI. This study was undertaken to describe the pattern of HIV DRMs following immunological monitoring and investigate its impact on the cycling of NRTI between first- and second-line ART. Methods and findings: This cross-sectional study was performed at a state-sponsored ART clinic of Pune city in western India between January and June 2016. Consecutive adults receiving first-line ART with immunological failure (IF) were recruited for plasma viral load (PVL) estimation. Randomly selected 80 participants with PVL >1000 copies/mL underwent HIV drug resistance genotyping. Of these, 75 plasma sample were successfully genotyped. The median CD4 count and duration of ART at the time of failure were 98 (IQR: 61.60–153.50) cells/L and 4.62 (IQR: 3.17–6.15) years, respectively. The prevalence of NRTI, non-NRTI, and major protease inhibitor resistance mutations were 89.30%, 96%, and 1.33%, respectively. Following first-line failure, sequences from 56.67% of individuals indicated low- to high-level resistance to all available NRTI. The proportion of sequences with 2 thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs) and 3 TAMs were 62.12% and 39.39%, respectively. An average of 1.98 TAMs per sequence were observed following IF as compared to 0.37 TAMs per sequence following targeted PVL monitoring at 12 months of ART from a prior study; this difference was significant (p<0.001). Conclusion: The option of cycling of NRTI analogues between first- and second-line regimens would no longer be effective if individuals are followed-up by immunological monitoring due to accumulation of mutations. Introduction of routine PVL monitoring is a priority for the long-term sustainability of free ART program in India.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181889;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0181889;;

Antiretroviral therapy initiation during acute/recent HIV infection limits HIV reservoirs and improves immune response in HIV infected individuals. Transmitted drug resistance may jeopardize the early goals of early antiretroviral treatment among acute/recent HIV infected patients. Methods Patients with acute/recent HIV infection who underwent resistance test before antiretroviral treatment initiation were included in this analysis. HIV-1 sequences were obtained using an in house protease/reverse transcriptase genotyping assay. Transmitted drug resistance was identified according to the Stanford HIV Database for Transmitted Drug Resistance Mutations, based on WHO 2009 surveillance list, and HIV-1 subtyping according to Rega HIV-1 subtyping tool. Comparison between patients with and without transmitted drug resistance was made using Kruskal–Wallis and Chi-square tests. Results Forty-three patients were included, 13 with acute HIV infection and 30 with recent HIV infection. The overall transmitted drug resistance prevalence was 16.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.1–30.0%). The highest prevalence of resistance (11.6%, 95% CI: 8.1–24.5) was against non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and K103N was the most frequently identified mutation. Conclusions The high prevalence of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors resistance indicates that efavirenz-based regimen without prior resistance testing is not ideal for acutely/recently HIV-infected individuals in our setting. In this context, the recent proposal of including integrase inhibitors as a first line regimen in Brazil could be an advantage for the treatment of newly HIV infected individuals. However, it also poses a new challenge, since integrase resistance test is not routinely performed for antiretroviral naive individuals. Further studies on transmitted drug resistance among acutely/recently HIV-infected are needed to inform the predictors of transmitted resistance and the antiretroviral therapy outcomes among these population.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1413867016303300;2.5;3.0;3.2;14138670;;;

Interleukin 27 (IL-27) is a new member of the IL-12 cytokine family and has been shown to interfere HIV-1 virus replication with controversial findings. This study is to investigate the dynamic changes in plasma IL-27 level and cell surface IL-27 receptor expression in HIV/AIDS patients who underwent HAART. Methods: Whole blood was collected from 34 HIV-positive/AIDS patients 0, 6, and 12 months after initiation of HAART and 27 healthy subjects. Plasma IL-27, IFN-, and IL-4 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while peripheral blood CD3+CD4+ T cells count and the gp130 expressed CD3+CD4+cell were measured by flow cytometry. Results: The plasma IL-27 concentration, IFN- concentration, and percentage of positive gp130 CD4 cells were significantly decreased in previously treatment-naive HIV/AIDS patients compared to healthy controls, but gradually increased 6 and 12 months after initiation of HAART. Conversely, IL-4 levels were significantly increased in treatment-naive HIV/AIDS patients compared to healthy controls, but gradually decreased 6 and 12 months after HAART. The concentrations of plasma IL-27 were positively correlated with the percentage of gp130 positive CD4 cells (r=0.438, p=0.016). Both plasma IL-27 concentration and gp130 positive cell percentage were positively associated with peripheral blood CD3+CD4+ T cell count (P<0.05 or P<0.01), but negatively associated with plasma HIV viral load (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Conclusion: IL-27 signaling (IL-27 and its receptor) may be involved in the pathogenesis of HIV infection and immune reconstitution in HIV/AIDS patients who underwent HAART. IL-27 may exert effects through regulating Th1/ Th2 ratio.;http://www.eurekaselect.com/152508/article;2.7;2.4;2.3;1570162X;;;

ART-naive HIV-1-infected patients from Cameroon were subjected to a multimethod HIVDR analysis using amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and longitudinal next-generation sequencing (NGS) to determine their profiles for the mutations K103N, Y181C, K65R, M184V, and T215F/Y. We processed 66 ARTnaive HIV-1-positive patients with highly diverse subtypes that underlined the predominance of CRF02-AG and the increasing rate of F2 and other recombinant forms in Cameroon. We compared three resistance testing methods for 5 major mutation sites. Using Sanger sequencing, the overall prevalence of HIVDR mutations was 7.6% (5/66) and included all studied mutations except K65R. Comparing ARMS-PCR with Sanger sequencing as a reference, we obtained a sensitivity of 100% (5/5) and a specificity of 95% (58/61), caused by three false-positive calls with ARMS-PCR. For 32/66 samples, we obtained NGS data and we observed two additional mismatches made up of minority variants (7% and 18%) that might not be clinically relevant. Longitudinal NGS analyses revealed changes in HIVDR mutations in all five positive subjects that could not be attributed to treatment. In one of these cases, superinfection led to the temporary masking of a resistant virus. HIVDR mutations can be sensitively detected by ARMS-PCR and sequencing methods with comparable performances. Longitudinal changes in HIVDR mutations have to be considered even in the absence of treatment.;https://jcm.asm.org/content/55/9/2785;8.0;8.2;8.6;00951137;;;

Objective: To evaluate safety and efficacy outcomes in HIV-1-infected younger versus older subjects treated with cobicistat-boosted darunavir. Method: In a 48-week, phase 3b, open-label trial, HIV-1-infected adults were administered darunavir 800 mg and cobicistat 150 mg once-daily with 2 nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs). Post hoc analyses examined safety and efficacy outcomes in subjects 45 and >45 years. Results: Of 313 subjects, 76% were 45 years (median [range] age, 31 [18-45]) and 24% were >45 years (49 [46-72]).

The single-tablet, fixed-dose combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide is a once-daily, integrase strand transfer inhibitor-based regimen approved in the USA and European Union for individuals aged 12 years or older. In this study, we aimed to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of this regimen in virologically suppressed, HIV-infected children. Methods In this single-arm, open-label trial, we enrolled virologically suppressed, HIV-infected children from five hospital clinics in Uganda, the USA, and Thailand. Eligible participants were aged 6–11 years, weighed 25 kg or more, had virological suppression (<50 copies of HIV-1 RNA per mL) on a stable regimen for at least 6 months, CD4 count of more than 100 cells per L, and no history of resistance to elvitegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide, or tenofovir. All participants received the available fixed-dose oral formulation of elvitegravir 150 mg, cobicistat 150 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir alafenamide 10 mg once per day. Primary outcomes were the pharmacokinetic parameters area under the curve (AUC) concentration at the end of the dosing interval (AUCtau) for elvitegravir and the AUC from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast) of tenofovir alafenamide, treatment-emergent serious adverse events, and all treatment-emergent adverse events. Results from baseline to week 24 are reported, unless specified otherwise. Primary and safety analyses included all enrolled participants who received one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01854775. Findings Between July 27 and Sept 28, 2015, we screened 26 children, of whom 23 were enrolled and initiated treatment. Median age was 10 years (IQR 8–11), median weight was 30·5 kg (IQR 27·5–33·0), and all participants had virological suppression. The mean AUCtau of elvitegravir was 33 814 ng × h/mL (coefficient of variation 58%), and the mean AUClast of tenofovir alafenamide was 333 ng × h/mL (45%). Exposures to elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide were higher, but modestly so, than those previously reported in adults. All 23 participants tolerated the regimen well; there were no serious adverse events or adverse event-related discontinuations. All participants maintained virological suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) at week 24. CD4 count decreased by a median of 130 cells per L (range 472 to 266) with little change in CD4 cell percentage (2·1%, range 8·4 to 5·9). Interpretation The fixed-dose combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide was efficacious and well tolerated in virologically suppressed, HIV-infected children. Although plasma exposure of all components was higher than has been reported in adults, there were no safety concerns and the overall bone and renal safety profile was favourable. These data support the use of this regimen in children at least 25 kg in weight. Funding Gilead Sciences.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352464217300093;1.1;3.2;6.4;;;;

Therefore, they represent a risk when pigs are used as sources of cells, tissues, or organs for xenotransplantation. Xenotransplantation is under development due to the increasing shortage of human transplants. Whereas most porcine microorganisms which may be able to induce a disease (zoonosis) in the transplant recipient can be eliminated, this is not possible in the case of PERVs. Antiretroviral drugs which had been developed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infections have been tested in vitro for their efficacy in inhibiting PERV replication. Inhibitors of the viral reverse transcriptase and of the integrase have been found effective. The most effective inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase was azidothymidine (AZT); the integrase inhibitors were the most potent inhibitors of PERV. Although in the past PERV transmission has not been observed after experimental or clinical xenotransplantation of pig cells or organs, and although PERVs may one day be inactivated in pigs by genome editing using CRISPR/Cas, knowing which antiretroviral drugs can effectively restrict PERV infection will still be important.";http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/9/8/213;5.8;5.3;4.3;;213;;

Three serious adverse events occurred (tension headache, infective endocarditis, and cervical dysplasia) and another three discontinued the study drug due to EFV intolerance. Conclusions This generic STR TDF/3TC/EFV is effective and well-tolerated. These findings lend support to the use of this generic STR as first-line antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited settings.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1201971217301637;5.3;5.6;5.3;12019712;;;

To elucidate the transmitted drug resistance (TDR) and acquired drug resistance mutation (ADR) profiles, we collected blood specimens from 127 drug-naïve and 117 first-line drug-treated HIV-1-infected individuals sampled from 2014 to 2016 in Suzhou. We successfully amplified pol fragments from 100 drug-naïve and 20 drug-treated samples. We then determined the drug-resistant mutations to protease (PR) and reverse-transcriptase (RT) inhibitors according to the Stanford drug resistance database. Overall, 11 and 13 individuals had transmitted (drug-naïve group) and acquired (treated group) resistance mutations, respectively. Six transmitted drug-resistant mutations were found, including two mutations (L33F and L76V) in the protease region and four (K70N/E and V179D/E) in the RT region. Only L76V was a major mutation, and K70N/E and V179D/E are known to cause low-level resistance to RT inhibitors. All 13 treated participants who had major drug resistance mutations demonstrated intermediate to high resistance to efavirenz and nevirapine, and six had a treatment duration of less than three months. No major mutations to RT inhibitors were found, implying that the epidemic of transmitted resistance mutations was not significant in this area. Our results suggest that more frequent virus load and drug resistance mutation tests should be conducted for individuals receiving antiretroviral treatment, especially for newly treated patients. Our research provides insights into the occurrence of HIV-1 drug resistance in Suzhou and will help to optimize the treatment strategy for this population.

The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor vorinostat (VOR) can increase HIV RNA expression in vivo within resting CD4+ T cells of aviremic HIV+ individuals. However, while studies of VOR or other HDAC inhibitors have reported reversal of latency, none has demonstrated clearance of latent infection. We sought to identify the optimal dosing of VOR for effective serial reversal of HIV latency. Methods. In a study of 16 HIV-infected, aviremic individuals, we measured resting CD4+ T cell-associated HIV RNA ex vivo and in vivo following a single exposure to VOR, and then in vivo after a pair of doses separated by 48 or 72 hours, and finally following a series of 10 doses given at 72-hour intervals. Results. Serial VOR exposures separated by 72 hours most often resulted in an increase in cell-associated HIV RNA within circulating resting CD4+ T cells. VOR was well tolerated by all participants. However, despite serial reversal of latency over 1 month of VOR dosing, we did not observe a measurable decrease (>0.3 log10) in the frequency of latent infection within resting CD4+ T cells. Conclusions. These findings outline parameters for the experimental use of VOR to clear latent infection. Latency reversal can be achieved by VOR safely and repeatedly, but effective depletion of persistent HIV infection will require additional advances. In addition to improvements in latency reversal, these advances may include the sustained induction of potent antiviral immune responses capable of recognizing and clearing the rare cells in which HIV latency has been reversed.;https://www.jci.org/articles/view/92684;21.2;19.0;17.0;00219738;;;

The prevailing hypothesis is that HAART availability and effectiveness have led to the perception among both individuals who are HIV-1 infected and those who are uninfected that HIV-1 transmission has become much less likely, and the effects of HIV-1 infection less deadly. This is expected to result in increased sexual risk-taking, especially unprotected anal intercourse, leading to more non-HIV-1 STDs, including gonorrhoea, chlamydia and syphilis. However, syphilis incidence has increased more rapidly than other STDs. We hypothesise that HAART downregulates the innate and acquired immune responses to Treponema pallidum and that this biological explanation plays an important role in the syphilis epidemic. Methods We performed a literature search and developed a mathematical model of HIV-1 and T. pallidum confection in a population with two risk groups with assortative mixing to explore the consequence on syphilis prevalence of HAART-induced changes in behaviour versus HAART-induced biological effects. Conclusions and implications Since rising syphilis incidence appears to have outpaced gonorrhoea and chlamydia, predominantly affecting HIV-1 positive MSM, behavioural factors alone may be insufficient to explain the unique, sharp increase in syphilis incidence. HAART agents have the potential to alter the innate and acquired immune responses in ways that may enhance susceptibility to T. pallidum. This raises the possibility that therapeutic and preventative HAART may inadvertently increase the incidence of syphilis, a situation that would have significant and global public health implications. We propose that additional studies investigating the interplay between HAART and enhanced T. pallidum susceptibility are needed. If our hypothesis is correct, HAART should be combined with enhanced patient management including frequent monitoring for pathogens such as T. pallidum.";https://sti.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/sextrans-2016-052870;6.0;5.5;6.1;13684973;;;

Methods: Eligible patients were adults with VL,50 copies/mL for at least 1 year on triple therapy with a ritonavir-boosted PI (PI/r) or an NNRTI. The study protocol consisted of the same regimen taken on four consecutive days per week followed by a 3 day drug interruption. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants remaining in the strategy with VL,50 copies/mL up to week 48. The study was designed to show an observed success rate of.90%, with a power of 87% and a 5% type 1 error. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02157311) and EudraCT (2014-000146-29). Results: One hundred patients (82 men),median age 47 years (IQR 40-53), were included. They had been receiving ART for a median of 5.1 (IQR 2.9-9.3) years and had a median CD4 cell count of 665 (IQR 543-829) cells/mm3. The ongoing regimen included PI/r in 29 cases and NNRTI in 71 cases. At 48 weeks, 96% of participants (95% CI 90%- 98%) had no failure while remaining on the 4-days-a-week regimen. Virological failure occurred in three participants, who all resumed daily treatment and became resuppressed. One participant stopped the strategy. No severe treatment-related events occurred. Conclusions: Antiretroviral maintenance therapy 4 days a week was effective for 48weeks in 96% of patients, leading to potential reduction of long-term toxicities, high adherence to the antiretroviral regimen and drug cost saving.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/73/3/738/4662829;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

We investigated the usefulness of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measured using inulin clearance (Cin), creatinine clearance (Ccr), and estimated GFR based on both serum creatinine (eGFRcre) and serum cystatin C (eGFRcys). Patients & methods: HIV-1-infected Japanese patients with suppressed viremia and whose antiretroviral drug was switched to dolutegravir from other drugs were included (n = 108, Study 1). We compared eGFRcre and eGFRcys at the start and after 48 weeks of dolutegravir administration. For the patients providing consent, we measured Cin and Ccr (n = 15, Study 2). We assessed biases and accuracy and compared Cin with eGFRcre, eGFRcys, and Ccr. Results: There were no differences in serum cystatin C and eGFRcys between baseline and at 48 weeks. Moreover, eGFRcre was significantly less accurate (within 30% of measured GFR) than both eGFRcys and Ccr (40% accuracy compared to 93% and 93%, respectively). eGFRcys was significantly less biased than eGFRcre and Ccr (p < 0.0001, p = 0.00036, respectively). No significant difference between Cin and eGFRcys was observed. eGFRcys was significantly correlated with Cin ( = 0.85, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: eGFRcys provided the most precise estimate and most closely approximate Cin in HIV-1-infected Japanese patients with suppressed viremia treated with dolutegravir. We demonstrated clinical benefits of inulin clearance and eGFRcys. This is the first study performing inulin clearance for HIV-1-infected individuals and to show data for eGFRcys from a large cohort following a switch to dolutegravir from other antiretroviral agents.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1341321X17302489;3.2;2.9;2.8;1341321X;;;

We assessed the efficacy and safety of ledipasvir–sofosbuvir for 8 weeks in HCV mono-infected and HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients. Methods: We enrolled patients mono-infected with genotype 1 HCV or co-infected with HCV and HIV-1 who were HCV treatment-naive and did not have cirrhosis. HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients were either not receiving antiretroviral treatment and had a CD4 T-cell count CloseSPigtSPi 500 cells/mm3 or were receiving a protocol-approved antiretroviral regimen for  8 weeks (or  6 months for abacavir-containing regimens) and had HIV-1 RNA OpenSPiltSPi 50 copies/mL and a CD4 T-cell count CloseSPigtSPi 200 cells/mm3. Patients received ledipasvir–sofosbuvir (90/400 mg) once daily for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation (SVR12). Results: The SVR12 rate was 100% (67/67) for HCV mono-infected patients and 97% (57/59) for HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients. Two patients relapsed by the week 4 post-treatment visit. Overall, the most common adverse events were headache (52%) and upper abdominal pain (26%). There were no serious adverse events or treatment discontinuations due to adverse events. No HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients receiving antiretroviral treatment experienced HIV virologic rebound, and no clinically meaningful changes in CD4 T-cell counts were observed in any co-infected patient. Conclusions: Non-cirrhotic, treatment-naive patients with genotype 1 HCV mono-infection and HCV/HIV-1 co-infection achieved high rates of SVR12 with 8 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir.

Methods: The ARAMIS microsimulation Markov model, evaluates costs and effects of DTG vs. first-line ARVs options including INIs (raltegravir, elvitegravir/c), protease inhibitors (PIs) (darunavir/r, atazanavir/r, lopinavir/r), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (efavirenz and rilpivirine). Efficacy and safety data were derived from phase III studies and network meta-analysis. Treatment algorithms were based on French guidelines and experts opinion. Costs included routine HIV and opportunistic infection care, and death. Results: The model showed the fixed-dose combination DTG/ABC/3TC was more effective than all other recommended regimens: patients stayed longer on first-line, and lived longer and healthier. With the exception of EFV, DTG/ABC/3TC was more efficacious and less costly compared to all strategies. The cost per QALY gained (ICER) for DTG compared to EFV was €6,939. DTG/ABC/3TC was more efficacious and less costly compared to INIs and PIs in all deterministic sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: DTG/ABC/3TC was cost-effective in the management of HIV TN patients in France. These results are mainly explained by its lower price compared to other INIs and PIs, DTG’s superior efficacy and high barrier to resistance.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14737167.2017.1359542;3.0;3.0;3.3;14737167;;;

DLBCL usually arises in lymph nodes, presenting as a painless rapid swelling mass in the neck, armpit, or groin. Case Report: Here, we report a case of DLBCL that needed only 3 months to develop a tumor 20x15 cm in diameter in the right groin and even caused scrotum swelling and lower-extremity edema.

Objectives: This study aimed to monitor the prevalence and risk factors associated with drug resistance in Taiwan after failure of first-line therapy. Materials and methods: Data from the Veterans General Hospital Surveillance and Monitor Network for the period 2009–2014 were analyzed. Plasma samples from patients diagnosed with virologic failure and an HIV-1 RNA viral load >1000 copies/mL were analyzed by the ViroSeq™ HIV-1 genotyping system for drug susceptibility. Hazard ratios (HRs) for drug resistance were calculated using a Cox proportional hazard model. Results: From 2009 to 2014, 359 patients were tested for resistance. The median CD4 count and viral load (log) were 214 cells/µL (interquartile range [IQR]: 71–367) and 4.5 (IQR: 3.9–5.0), respectively. Subtype B HIV-1 strains were found in 90% of individuals. The resistance rate to any of the three classes of antiretroviral drugs (NRTI, NNRTI, and PI) was 75.5%. The percentage of NRTI, NNRTI, and PI resistance was 58.6%, 61.4%, and 11.4%, respectively. The risk factors for any class of drug resistance included age 35 years (adjusted HR: 2.30, CI: 1.48–3.56; p<0.0001), initial NNRTI-based antiretroviral regimens (adjusted HR: 1.70, CI: 1.10–2.63; p=0.018), and current NNRTI-based antiretroviral regimens when treatment failure occurs (odds ratio: 4.04, CI: 2.47–6.59; p<0.001). There was no association between HIV-1 subtype, viral load, and resistance. Conclusion: This study demonstrated a high level of resistance to NRTI and NNRTI in patients with virologic failure to first-line antiretroviral therapy despite routine viral load monitoring. Educating younger men who have sex with men to maintain good adherence is crucial, as PI use is associated with lower possibility of drug resistance.";https://www.dovepress.com/high-rate-of-hiv-1-drug-resistance-in-treatment-failure-patients-in-ta-peer-reviewed-article-IDR;6.6;2.8;2.4;;;;

The aim of our retrospective study was to investigate changes in cardiovascular risk after switching from a tenofovir-sparing to a tenofovir-containing backbone. Lipid parameters and cardiovascular risk [calculated using 10-years Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and 5-years DAD Risk Score (DRS)] were analysed at baseline and after three months. 273 patients were enrolled. After switching, significant decreases in total cholesterol (TC) (–8.2mg/dl, p < 0.001), LDL (–8.7mg/dl, p < 0.001) and DRS (mean –0.26%, p < 0.001) were observed, while a reduction in FRS was only observed in patients with pre-switch high TC or medium-high (>10%) FRS. Pre-switch factors associated with DRS reduction were higher TC, abacavir, new generation protease inhibitors, while zidovudine predicted an increase of DRS. Our results suggest that the improvement of lipid parameters observed after switching to a tenofovir-containing backbone could lead to a significant reduction in predicted cardiovascular risk, which became more evident in subjects with higher cardiovascular risk.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1120009X.2016.1269040;2.3;2.6;2.6;1120009X;;;

Little is known of GH/IGF-1 axis alterations with antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation or differing ART therapies. The AIDS Clinical Trials Group Prospective Evaluation of Antiretrovirals in Resource-Limited Settings (PEARLS) study was a prospective, randomized clinical trial of ART initiation with emtricitabine/tenofovir + efavirenz (FTC/TDF+EFV) versus lamivudine/zidovudine + efavirenz (3TC/ZDV+EFV) in HIV-1-infected individuals from resource-diverse settings. IGF-1 was measured from baseline, week 48, and week 96 stored serum samples. Multivariate models were constructed. 415 participants were included: 170 (41%) were randomized to FTC/TDF+EFV and 245 (59%) to 3TC/ZDV+EFV. The mean age was 35 years, 60% were black, 42% women. The mean IGF-1 level did not change significantly from baseline to week 96 (-0.65 ng/ml; 95% confidence interval (CI)-5.18-3.87), p = .78 and there were no differences by treatment arm at week 96, p = .74.

Greater change in IGF-1 from baseline to 96 weeks was associated with female sex, smaller WHR change, lower baseline albumin, and higher baseline HIV-1 RNA (all p < .01). ART initiation with either ZDV or TDF did not significantly impact overall IGF-1 levels. Baseline and on-Treatment changes in IGF-1 with ART initiation may be related to the body composition changes that occur after ART initiation.";http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2016.0327;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

We investigated long-term VL and resistance in HIV-infected children managed without real-time VL monitoring. Methods and findings: In the ARROW factorial trial, 1,206 children initiating ART in Uganda and Zimbabwe between 15 March 2007 and 18 November 2008, aged a median 6 years old, with median CD4% of 12%, were randomised to monitoring with or without 12-weekly CD4 counts and to receive 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (2NRTI, mainly abacavir+lamivudine) with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or 3 NRTIs as long-term ART. All children had VL assayed retrospectively after a median of 4 years on ART; those with >1,000 copies/ml were genotyped. Three hundred and sixteen children had VL and genotypes assayed longitudinally (at least every 24 weeks). Overall, 67 (6%) switched to second-line ART and 54 (4%) died. In children randomised to WHO-recommended 2NRTI+NNRTI long-term ART, 308/378 (81%) monitored with CD4 counts versus 297/375 (79%) without had VL <1,000 copies/ml at 4 years (difference = +2.3% [95% CI 3.4% to +8.0%]; P = 0.43), with no evidence of differences in intermediate/high-level resistance to 11 drugs. Among children with longitudinal VLs, only 5% of child-time post–week 24 was spent with persistent low-level viraemia (80–5,000 copies/ml) and 10% with VL rebound 5,000 copies/ml. No child resuppressed <80 copies/ml after confirmed VL rebound 5,000 copies/ml. A median of 1.0 (IQR 0.0,1.5) additional NRTI mutation accumulated over 2 years’ rebound. Nineteen out of 48 (40%) VLs 1,000–5,000 copies/ml were immediately followed by resuppression <1,000 copies/ml, but only 17/155 (11%) VLs 5,000 copies/ml resuppressed (P < 0.0001). Main study limitations are that analyses were exploratory and treatment initiation used 2006 criteria, without pre-ART genotypes. Conclusions: In this study, children receiving first-line ART in sub-Saharan Africa without real-time VL monitoring had good virological and resistance outcomes over 4 years, regardless of CD4 monitoring strategy. Many children with detectable low-level viraemia spontaneously resuppressed, highlighting the importance of confirming virological failure before switching to second-line therapy. Children experiencing rebound 5,000 copies/ml were much less likely to resuppress, but NRTI resistance increased only slowly. These results are relevant to the increasing numbers of HIV-infected children receiving first-line ART in sub-Saharan Africa with limited access to virological monitoring.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002432;14.1;15.5;15.5;15491277;e1002432;;

METHODS A retrospective cohort study of 40 subjects co-infected with HIV-1 and HCV treated with the fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir for 12 wk from 2014 to 2016. All patients included were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) with HIV RNA values of 100 copies/mL or fewer regardless of baseline HCV RNA level. The primary end point was a sustained virologic response of HCV at 12 wk (SVR12) after the end of therapy. RESULTS Of the 40 patients enrolled, 55% were black, 22.5% had been previously treated for HCV, and 25% had cirrhosis. The patients were on a wide range of ART. Overall, 39 patients (97.5%) had a SVR 12 after the end of therapy, including rates of 97.1% in patients with HCV genotype 1a and 100% in those with HCV genotype 1b. One patient with HCV genotype 3a was included and achieved SVR12. Rates of SVR12 were similar regardless of previous treatment or the presence of compensated cirrhosis. Only 1 patient experienced relapse at week 12 following treatment and deep sequencing didn't reveal any resistance associated mutation in the NS5A or NS5B region. Interestingly, 7 (17.5%) patients who were adherent to ART experienced HIV viral breakthrough which resolved after continuing the same ART regimen. Two (5%) patients experienced HIV-1 virologic rebound due to noncompliance with HIV therapy, which resolved after resuming the same ART regimen. No severe adverse events were observed and no patient discontinued treatment because of adverse events. The most common adverse events included headache (12.5%), fatigue (10%), and diarrhea (2.5%).;http://www.wjgnet.com/1948-5182/full/v9/i30/1190.htm;6.6;8.2;5.8;;;;

We developed the Full-Length Individual Proviral Sequencing (FLIPS) assay to determine the distribution of latent replication-competent HIV-1 within memory CD4+ T cell subsets in six individuals on long-term ART. FLIPS is an efficient, high-throughput assay that amplifies and sequences near full-length (9 kb) HIV-1 proviral genomes and determines potential replication competency through genetic characterization. FLIPS provides a genome-scale perspective that addresses the limitations of other methods that also genetically characterize the latent reservoir. Using FLIPS, we identified 5% of proviruses as intact and potentially replication competent. Intact proviruses were unequally distributed between T cell subsets, with effector memory cells containing the largest proportion of genetically intact HIV-1 proviruses. We identified multiple identical intact proviruses, suggesting a role for cellular proliferation in the maintenance of the latent HIV-1 reservoir. Latent, replication-competent HIV-1 proviruses pose a significant barrier to an HIV-1 cure. Hiener et al. present the Full-Length Individual Proviral Sequencing (FLIPS) assay to reveal the distribution of genetically intact and potentially replication-competent HIV-1 proviruses in different T cell subsets isolated from individuals on long-term antiretroviral therapy.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211124717313864;12.6;12.3;12.6;;;;

This evolutionary process typically takes several years and is poorly understood as selection taking place in germinal centers occurs on the basis of antibody affinity. B cells with the highest-affinity receptors tend to acquire the most antigen from the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network and present the highest density of cognate peptides to follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, which provide survival signals to the B cell. bnAbs are therefore expected to evolve only when the B cell lineage evolving breadth is consistently capturing and presenting more peptides to Tfh cells than other lineages of more specific B cells. Here we develop mathematical models of Tfh cells in germinal centers to explicitly define the mechanisms of selection in this complex evolutionary process. Our results suggest that broadly reactive B cells presenting a high density of peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (pMHC) are readily outcompeted by B cells responding to lineages of HIV-1 that transiently dominate the within host viral population. Conversely, if broadly reactive B cells acquire a large variety of several HIV-1 proteins from the FDC network and present a high diversity of several pMHC, they can be rescued by a large fraction of the Tfh cell repertoire in the germinal center. Under such circumstances the evolution of bnAbs is much more consistent. Increasing either the magnitude of the Tfh cell response or the breadth of the Tfh cell repertoire markedly facilitates the evolution of bnAbs. Because both the magnitude and breadth can be increased by vaccination with several HIV-1 proteins, this calls for experimental testing.;https://JVI.asm.org/lookup/doi/10.1128/JVI.00983-17;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;e00983-17;;

In the study of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection, selective depletion of CCR5+CD4+ Tscm cells and the high proliferation rate of these cells are believed to be responsible for the pathogenesis of SIV-infected rhesus macaques. Here, we conducted a cohort study to investigate the influence of chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection on CD4+ Tscm cell homeostasis, and the effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on CD4+ Tscm cells. Chronic HIV-1 infection resulted in a decrease of the CD4+ Tscm cell proportion in HIV-1 patients. The decreased number of CD4+ Tscm cells in HIV-1 patients correlated positively with that of circulating CD4+ T cells. Further, the depletion of CD4+ Tscm cells was inversely correlated with an increased level of T cell immune activation during chronic HIV-1 infection. Prolonged ART recovered the CD4+ Tscm cells, and the dynamic change of CD4+ Tscm cells was in parallel with CD4+ T cell restoration and a decrease in the level of T cell immune activation. We propose that the abnormity of CD4+ Tscm cells may contribute to the pathogenesis and disease progression in HIV-1-infected individuals.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/vim.2017.0017;2.7;2.6;2.9;08828245;;;

For a successful programmatic uptake, these efforts merit to be supported by thorough assessments of antiretroviral therapy response and HIV-1 drug resistance surveillance, especially with risks of cross-resistance due to the gradual stavudine phasing out in such national settings. We therefore evaluated the virological response to antiretroviral therapy, HIV-1 drug resistance emergence and circulating HIV-1 clades in a Chad context. A cross-sectional and prospective study was conducted among 116 patients (41 [ ± 6.87] years, 59% female) receiving first-line antiretroviral therapy for  6 months in Ndjamena, Chad, in 2011-2012, enrolled consecutively. To ensure accuracy, plasma viral load was concomitantly measured using Abbott Real-Time and Cobas AmpliPrep/TaqMan (v2.0), and virological failure defined as  1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml. Plasma from patients experiencing virological failure were processed for sequencing of HIV-1 protease-reverse transcriptase using the ANRS-AC.11 resistance testing protocol; drug resistant mutations were interpreted using the ANRS-AC11 algorithm; and phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA.v.6. Results: Majority of patients was receiving zidovudine plus lamivudine plus nevirapine (46%), stavudine plus lamivudine plus nevirapine (41%) and tenofovir plus emtricitabine plus efavirenz (11%), for a median time-on-treatment of 5 [IQR 4-7] years. The rate of virological failure was 43% (50/116), with 86% (43/50) sequencing performance. Overall, 32% (37/116) patients presented  one major drug resistant mutation(s), with 29% (34/116) to nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (67% [29/43] M184V/I, 30% [13/43] T215Y/F, 19% [8/43] V75A/F/I/L/M, 9% [4/43] K70P/R/W, 9% [4/43] K219E/N/Q and 5% [2/43] A62V); 86% (37/43) to non-nulceos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (30% [13/43] K103N/S/E, 26% [11/43] Y181C/V/F/L, 2% [1/43] L100I, 2% [1/43] F227L, 2% [1/43] P225H); and 2% (1/43) to protease inhibitors (M46I, I54V, V82S). Six HIV-1 subtypes were found: 30% circulating recombinant form (CRF02-AG), 30% J, 16% G, 9% A, 9% D, 5% F. Conclusions: In Chad, almost half of patients are failing first-line antiretroviral therapy after 5 years, with considerable drug resistant mutations at failure. Absence of K65R supports the use of tenofovir-containing regimens as preferred first-line and as suitable drug for second-line combinations, in this setting with significant HIV-1 genetic diversity.";https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-017-2893-1;2.6;2.1;2.1;;589;;

We report 48-week results from a study comparing initial HIV-1 treatment with bictegravir—a novel INSTI with a high in-vitro barrier to resistance and low potential as a perpetrator or victim of clinically relevant drug interactions—coformulated with the NRTI combination emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide as a fixed-dose combination to dolutegravir administered with coformulated emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide. Methods In this randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial, HIV-infected adults were screened and enrolled at 126 outpatient centres in 10 countries in Australia, Europe, Latin America, and North America. Participants were previously untreated adults (HIV-1 RNA 500 copies per mL) with estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 mL/min. Chronic hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C co-infection was allowed. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive oral fixed-dose combination bictegravir 50 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg or dolutegravir 50 mg with coformulated emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg, with matching placebo, once a day for 144 weeks. Investigators, participants, study staff, and those assessing outcomes were masked to treatment group. All participants who received at least one dose of study drug were included in primary efficacy and safety analyses. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies per mL at week 48 (US Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm), with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 12%. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02607956. Findings Between Nov 11, 2015, and July 15, 2016, 742 participants were screened for eligibility, of whom 657 were randomly assigned to treatment (327 with bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fixed-dose combination [bictegravir group] and 330 with dolutegravir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide [dolutegravir group]). 320 participants who received the bictegravir regimen and 325 participants who received the dolutegravir regimen were included in the primary efficacy analyses. At week 48, HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL was achieved in 286 (89%) of 320 participants in the bictegravir group and 302 (93%) of 325 in the dolutegravir group (difference 3·5%, 95·002% CI 7·9 to 1·0, p=0·12), showing non-inferiority of the bictegravir regimen to the dolutegravir regimen. No treatment-emergent resistance to any study drug was observed. Incidence and severity of adverse events were similar between groups, and few participants discontinued treatment due to adverse events (5 [2%] of 320 in the bictegravir group and 1 [<1%] 325 in the dolutegravir group). Study drug-related adverse events were less common in the bictegravir group than in the dolutegravir group (57 [18%] of 320 vs 83 [26%] of 325, p=0·022). Interpretation At 48 weeks, virological suppression with the bictegravir regimen was achieved and was non-inferior to the dolutegravir regimen in previously untreated adults. There was no emergent resistance to either regimen. The fixed-dose combination of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide was safe and well tolerated compared with the dolutegravir regimen.

Bictegravir is a novel, potent INSTI with a high in-vitro barrier to resistance and low potential as a perpetrator or victim of clinically relevant drug–drug interactions. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of bictegravir coformulated with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide as a fixed-dose combination versus coformulated dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine. Methods We did this double-blind, multicentre, active-controlled, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial at 122 outpatient centres in nine countries in Europe, Latin America, and North America. We enrolled HIV-1 infected adults (aged 18 years) who were previously untreated (HIV-1 RNA 500 copies per mL); HLA-B*5701-negative; had no hepatitis B virus infection; screening genotypes showing sensitivity to emtricitabine, tenofovir, lamivudine, and abacavir; and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 50 mL/min or more. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated allocation sequence (block size of four), to receive coformulated bictegravir 50 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg or coformulated dolutegravir 50 mg, abacavir 600 mg, and lamivudine 300 mg, with matching placebo, once daily for 144 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by HIV-1 RNA (100 000 copies per mL, >100 000 to 400 000 copies per mL, or >400 000 copies per mL), CD4 count (<50 cells per L, 50–199 cells per L, or 200 cells per L), and region (USA or ex-USA). Investigators, participants, and study staff giving treatment, assessing outcomes, and collecting data were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL at week 48, as defined by the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm, with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 12%. All participants who received one dose of study drug were included in primary efficacy and safety analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02607930. Findings Between Nov 13, 2015, and July 14, 2016, we randomly assigned 631 participants to receive coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (n=316) or coformulated dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine (n=315), of whom 314 and 315 patients, respectively, received at least one dose of study drug. At week 48, HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL was achieved in 92·4% of patients (n=290 of 314) in the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group and 93·0% of patients (n=293 of 315) in the dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine group (difference 0·6%, 95·002% CI 4·8 to 3·6; p=0·78), demonstrating non-inferiority of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide to dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine. No individual developed treatment-emergent resistance to any study drug. Incidence and severity of adverse events was mostly similar between groups except for nausea, which occurred less frequently in patients given bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide than in those given dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine (10% [n=32] vs 23% [n=72]; p<0·0001). Adverse events related to study drug were less common with bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide than with dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine (26% [n=82] vs 40% [n=127]), the difference being driven by a higher incidence of drug-related nausea in the dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine group (5% [n=17] vs 17% [n=55]; p<0·0001). Interpretation At 48 weeks, coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide achieved virological suppression in 92% of previously untreated adults and was non-inferior to coformulated dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine, with no treatment-emergent resistance. Bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide was safe and well tolerated with better gastrointestinal tolerability than dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine. Because coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide does not require HLA B*5701 testing and provides guideline-recommended treatment for individuals co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B, this regimen might lend itself to rapid or same-day initiation of therapy in the clinical setting.

Method Between November 2015 and April 2016, we conducted retrospective study on HCV infection among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA). A total of 491 PLHA were included in this study and tested for the presence of HCV infection. HIV viral loads were obtained using the Generic HIV viral Load® assay and the CD4+ T cells count was performed using BD FACSCount™ CD4 reagents. HCV screening was performed using the MP Diagnostics HCV ELISA 4.0 kit. HCV genotypes were determined by sequence analysis of NS5B and Core regions. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the groups. Chi-2 test and Fisher’s Exact Test were used to compare prevalence. Results HCV seroprevalence was 2.9% (14/491), (95% confidence interval (CI):1.4–4.3%). The percentage of HCV viremic patients, defined by the detection of HCV RNA in plasma, was 57% (8/14), representing 1.6% of the total population. HCV seroprevalence and replicative infection were not statistically differ with gender. The percentage of co-infection increased with age. No correlation with CD4+ T cells count and HIV viral load level was registered in this study. Identified HCV strains were predominantly of genotype 4 (87.5%) including 4k, 4e, 4g, 4p, 4f and 4c subtypes. Only one strain belonged to genotype 2 (subtype 2q). Analysis of the NS5B region did not reveal the presence of resistance-associated substitutions for sofosbuvir. Conclusion A systematic screening of hepatitis C is therefore strongly recommended as well as genotyping of HCV strains in order to adapt treatments for the specific case of people living with HIV/AIDS in Central Africa.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0190529;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0190529;;

Background: Total HIV-DNA load in peripheral blood cell (PBMCs) reflects the global viral reservoir that seems not to be affected by antiretroviral treatment. However, some studies reported a different permeability of different drugs in cellular compartments. Objective: To investigate the relation between the amount of total HIV-1 DNA and different treatment strategies. Methods: Total HIV-1 DNA was quantified by real time PCR in PBMCs collected from 161 patients with long-term undetectable HIV-RNA receiving different therapy schedules (3-drug regimens or 2-drug regimen containing Raltegravir as integrase inhibitor). Results: Overall, HIV patients who started therapy with a median pre-ART CD4+ cell count >400 cells/mm 3 and HIV viral load of 3 log 10 copies/ml, achieved a lower amount of HIV total DNA. No significant correlation was found in DNA size when patients were stratified on the basis of different therapeutic protocols. However, HIV DNA load analysis, when only performed in HIV patients with a median pre-ART CD4+ cell count >200 cells/mm 3 and HIV viral load < 3 log 10 copies/ml, showed a significative DNA decrease in Raltegravir treated group with respect to the NNRTIs-treated group. Conclusion: The data emphasize that HIV-DNA level represents a predictive factor in long-term suppressive therapy patients. In addition, the diminished reservoir, only observed in patients treated with the NRTI-sparing regimen RAL plus PI/r before immunological and virological derangement, suggests that latest generation drugs, such as integrase inhibitors, might represent an optimal chance in the management of HIV infection.;http://www.eurekaselect.com/158119/article;2.7;2.4;2.3;1570162X;;;

Because women are often under-represented in HIV clinical trials, we addressed the safety and efficacy of dolutegravir in women with HIV-1. Methods The ARIA study is a randomised, open-label, multicentre, active-controlled, parallel-group, non-inferiority phase 3b study done in 86 hospital and university infectious disease clinics, local health clinics, and private infectious disease clinics in 12 countries and one US territory, in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Eligible participants were women aged 18 years or older who had HIV-1 RNA viral loads of 500 copies per mL or greater, had received 10 days or less of previous antiretroviral therapy, and had tested negative for the HLA-B*5701 allele. Pregnant women were excluded. Eligible women were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either a single-tablet regimen of dolutegravir plus abacavir and lamivudine once a day (dolutegravir group) or a three-tablet combination of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus coformulated tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine once a day (atazanavir group). Random treatment group assignment was stratified by plasma HIV-1 RNA viral loads and CD4 cell count at baseline. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA viral loads of less than 50 copies per mL at week 48 in all participants who received at least one dose of study medication (intention-to-treat exposed population). We used a non-inferiority margin of 12%. Investigators monitored adverse events to assess safety. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01910402. Findings Between Aug 22, 2013, and Sept 22, 2015, of 705 women assessed, 499 were randomly assigned to either the dolutegravir group (n=250) or the atazanavir group (n=249); two participants from each group were randomised to treatment but did not receive study medication. At week 48, 203 (82%) of 248 participants in the dolutegravir group compared with 176 (71%) of 247 in the atazanavir group had HIV-1 RNA viral loads of less than 50 copies per mL (mean difference 10·5%, 95% CI 3·1–17·8, p=0·005). One participant in the atazanavir group had nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor–associated resistance that led to reduced emtricitabine susceptibility. Adverse events were similar between the dolutegravir and atazanavir groups; the most common were nausea (46 [19%] of 248 in the dolutegravir group vs 49 [20%] of 247 in the atazanavir group) and headache (28 [11%] vs 32 [13%]). Fewer participants in the dolutegravir group than the atazanavir group reported drug-related adverse events (83 [33%] vs 121 [49%]) or adverse events that led to discontinuation (ten [4%] vs 17 [7%]). One death was reported in each treatment group, but neither was considered related to the study medications. Interpretation The non-inferior efficacy and similar safety profile of the dolutegravir combined regimen compared with the atazanavir regimen support the use of dolutegravir for HIV-1 infection in treatment-naive women.

This study obtained a sensitive assessment of the resistance patterns associated with long-term tenofovir-based ART in a programmatic setting where virological monitoring is yet to become part of routine care. Methods: We studied subjects who, after a median of 4.2 years of ART, replaced zidovudine or stavudine with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate while continuing lamivudine and an NNRTI. Using deep sequencing, resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) were detected in stored samples collected at tenofovir introduction (T0) and after a median of 4.0 years (T1). Results: At T0, 19/87 (21.8%) subjects showed a detectable viral load and 8/87 (9.2%) had one or more major NNRTI RAMs, whereas 82/87 (94.3%) retained full tenofovir susceptibility. At T1, 79/87 (90.8%) subjects remained on NNRTI-based ART, 5/87 (5.7%) had introduced lopinavir/ritonavir due to immunological failure, and 3/87 (3.4%) had interrupted ART. Whilst 68/87 (78.2%) subjects maintained or achieved virological suppression between T0 and T1, a detectable viral load with NNRTI RAMs at T0 predicted lack of virological suppression at T1. Each treatment interruption, usually reflecting unavailability of the dispensary, doubled the risk of T1 viraemia. Tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz selected for K65R, K70E/T, L74I/V and Y115F, alongside M184V and multiple NNRTI RAMs; this resistance profile was accompanied by high viral loads and low CD4 cell counts. Conclusions: Viraemia on tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz led to complex resistance patterns with implications for continued drug activity and risk of onward transmission.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/73/11/3148/5055837;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

Although initial studies showed poor efficacy and/or substantial toxicity, more recent regimens have held greater promise. The SWORD-1 and -2 studies were pivotal trials of dolutegravir plus rilpivirine as maintenance therapy in virologically suppressed patients with no history of drug resistance, leading to the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the regimen as a small, single tablet. More recently, the GEMINI-1 and -2 studies demonstrated that dolutegravir plus lamivudine is as safe and effective as the same regimen when combined with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in treatment-naïve individuals. Together, these and other studies of novel two-drug regimens offer the potential for improved tolerability and simplicity, as well as a reduction in cost. We will review historical and recent trials of two-drug therapy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.;https://www.dovepress.com/two-drug-regimens-for-treatment-of-naive-hiv-1-infection-and-as-mainte-peer-reviewed-article-DDDT;5.0;5.7;5.0;;;;

Using conventional sequencing methods to determine antiretroviral resistance, mutations present in 20% of quasispecies can be identified, but drug-resistant minority variants can lead to virologic failure. Objective: We aimed to assess transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRMs) within minority variants using ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS). Method: Treatment-naive adult patients were included in this observational study. Surveillance TDRMs were classified as 20% or at minority variant level (2% – <20%). Genotypic sensitivity score calculated by using all pre-treatment drug resistance mutations (PDRMs) was also evaluated. Results: Thirty-six patients were analyzed. Any TDRM at 20% level was detected in 8.3% of the patients (n=3). This prevalence increased to 30.6% (n=11) with the inclusion of minority variants. All non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and protease inhibitor-related TDRMs were within minority variants. The genotypic sensitivity score of rilpivirine-based regimens was considerably diminished when minority variants were included in the PDRM analysis. Conclusion: UDPS was used for the first time to assess TDRM in a Turkish HIV cohort and uncovered several mutations hidden within minority variants. UDPS may be preferred to detect PDRMs for avoiding virologic failure with rilpivirine-based ART regimens.";http://www.eurekaselect.com/165243/article;2.7;2.4;2.3;1570162X;;;

The aim of this study is to explore ART adherence rates in Turkey. Included in this study were a total of 263 HIV-infected patients followed up by the ACTHIV-IST (ACTion against HIV in Istanbul) Study Group affiliated with four tertiary hospitals. The study population included patients 18 years of age or older who were on ART for over 12 months. Adherence was assessed by the medication possession ratio (MPR) calculated for each patient using data (a list of all drugs dispensed within the previous year for that patient) obtained from pharmacy medication records. In addition, patients completed a self-report questionnaire addressing missed doses and the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) adherence questionnaire. The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty. Patient ages ranged from 19 to 71 years. Two hundred and thirty-one patients were male (88%). Two hundred and twenty-four patients (85%) had optimal adherence (MPR 95%). During the course of ART, 236 patients (90%) reported no missed doses in the past 4 days of their treatment, whereas 206 patients (78%) reported no missed doses in the past month. Simply forgetting was the most common reason for nonadherence. MPR was associated with virologic rebound. Major factors affecting adherence were being female, taking antituberculosis drugs, having an opportunistic infection, being able to take all or most of the medication as directed, and being aware of the need to take medication exactly as instructed to prevent the development of drug resistance. Adherence to ART measured by MPR and self-report surveys is relatively high in Turkey when compared with other countries, which probably led to high ART success rates.;http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2016.0266;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

All rights reserved.Background: Despite advances made with the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the control of the HIV 1 infection, a cure has not been achieved because of the persistence of viral reservoirs. The major HIV reservoirs remain in the lymphoid follicles because of, among other factors, the partial absence of CD8+ T-cells in these structures. Recently, lymphoid follicle- confined and circulating CD8+ T-cells expressing the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5) were described, possessing antiviral mechanisms that could help to control HIV replication. Setting and Methods: By flow cytometry, we characterized the phenotype and function of circulating CXCR5-expressing CD8+ Tcells in HIV-infected patients with natural or HAART-induced control of HIV replication. Results: Circulating CXCR5-expressing CD8+ T-cells exhibited low or null expression of the C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) and had a transitional memory phenotype. Particular redistributions of CXCR5-expressing CD8+ T-cells were found in HIV-infected patients, and they were partially restored by HAART. The frequency of CXCR5hiCCR7-/lo CD8+ T-cells was higher in spontaneous HIV controllers and negatively correlated with plasma HIV RNA levels. Total and HIV-specific CXCR5+ CD8+ T-cells were major producers of interleukin-21, and this function was positively associated with their interferon- production. Conclusions: Circulating CXCR5-expressing CD8+ T-cells are associated with low-level HIV replication; these cells could be novel correlates of protection, and potentially useful in the eradication of HIV reservoirs.";http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201808010-00016;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

This study aimed to evaluate DRMs amongst immune competent treatment-naïve children in Cameroon. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between 2015 and 2016 amongst 55 proxy consented HIV-1 positive children, aged 9 month to 6 years. They were all immune competent, cART naïve and with unknown history of PMTCT. CD4 cell counts and genotypic drug resistance testing were performed using standard methods. Results Levels of DRMs to protease (PR) inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-NRTIs were 27.6%, 3.7% and 40.7%, respectively. Only minor DRMs were observed for PR. The observed mutations for NRTI were K65R, T215I and K219E (33.0% each) and for NNRTI: V106M, Y181C and Y188H (6.0% each). Only minor accessory mutations were found in the integrase (IN) region. Conclusion Despite widely available cART we still observe naïve HIV children, especially from the rural communities. We observe that a proportion of study participants had HIV-1 drug resistance associated mutations (RAMs). Data generated could help strengthen the current PMTCT programmes within the country. There is a need to upscale approaches for drug resistance testing for children in Cameroon and many other resource-limited settings.;http://www.germs.ro/en/Articles/Observed-HIV-drug-resistance-associated-mutations-amongst-na%C3%AFve-immunocompetent-children-in-Yaound%C3%A9-Cameroon-702;1.2;1.8;2.0;;;;

Based on the evidence from high-income countries (HIC), the risk of an enhanced, and accentuated onset of premature-aging or age-related diseases has been observed in PLHIV. However, very limited data is available on residual inflammation and immune activation in the populations who are on first-generation anti-HIV drugs like zidovudine and lamivudine that have more toxic side effects. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the levels of systemic inflammation and understand the risk of age-associated diseases in PLHIV on long-term suppressive ART using a large number of biomarkers of inflammation and immune activation. Blood samples were obtained from therapy naïve PLHIV (Pre-ART, n = 43), PLHIV on ART for >5 years (ART, n = 53), and HIV-negative healthy controls (HIVNC, n = 41). Samples were analyzed for 92 markers of inflammation, sCD14, sCD163, and telomere length. Several statistical tests were performed to compare the groups under study. Multivariate linear regression was used to investigate the associations. Despite a median duration of 8 years of successful ART, sCD14 (p < 0.001) and sCD163 (p = 0.04) levels continued to be significantly elevated in ART group as compared to HIVNC. Eleven inflammatory markers, including 4E-BP1, ADA, CCL23, CD5, CD8A, CST5, MMP1, NT3, SLAMF1, TRAIL, and TRANCE, were found to be significantly different (p < 0.05) between the groups. Many of these markers are associated with age-related co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease, neurocognitive decline and some of these markers are being reported for the first time in the context of HIV-induced inflammation. Linear regression analysis showed a significant negative association between HIV-1-positivity and telomere length (p < 0.0001). In ART-group CXCL1 (p = 0.048) and TGF- (p = 0.026) showed a significant association with the increased telomere length and IL-10RA was significantly associated with decreased telomere length (p = 0.042). This observation warrants further mechanistic studies to generate evidence to highlight the need for enhanced treatment monitoring and special interventions in HIV-infected individuals.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01965/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;1965;;

Dual coinfection of HCV and HBV in HIV-1-infected population is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Also, they share routes of HIV transmission; however, it might be associated with an independent factor like injecting drug use for HCV and unsafe sex for HBV. This case report suggests that hepatitis virus coinfection may lead to late response of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-1 patients. Patients and Methods. A 49-year-old male patient visited for the routine follow-up investigation at the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL), Teku, Nepal. He was an HIV-1-positive injecting drug user (IDU) co-infected with HCV and HBV. The patient was under ART as per the National HIV Testing and Treatment Guidelines 2017, Nepal. Further, serological and viral load testing was performed for confirmation and monitoring therapy, respectively. Results. It is the first report that highlights the dual coinfection of HCV and HBV in an HIV-1 patient from Nepal. The follow-up investigation shows improved response to ART with an increase in CD4+ cells. However, detectable viral loads indicated for a late response might be due to effects of coinfections or viral interactions. Conclusions. Dual coinfection is rare; however, it is more serious with poorly defined epidemiology and evolution in an HIV-1-infected population. Thus, universal screening of HBV or/and HCV coinfection in HIV-1-infected population requires immediate implementation for true prevalence, proper management, and early intervention.";https://www.hindawi.com/journals/crim/2019/2070973/;0;0;1.1;16879627;2070973;;

The fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and abacavir sulfate has been developed to contribute to low pill burden of antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen and patient adherence. A mandatory post-marketing surveillance was conducted in Korea to monitor the safety of Kivexa (lamivudine 300 mg/abacavir 600 mg). Materials and Methods: An open label, multi-center, non-interventional post-marketing surveillance was conducted to monitor the safety of Kivexa from July 2011 to July 2017 in 23 hospitals in Korea. Subjects over 12 years old taking Kivexa per prescribing information were enrolled. The primary outcome was defined as the occurrence of any adverse events during the study period. Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of adverse drug reaction, the occurrence of serious adverse events and the effectiveness of Kivexa. Results: A total of 600 patients from 23 hospitals were enrolled within the 6 years of study. The total observation period was 1,004 person-years. Three hundred and ten patients reported 674 adverse events. The incidence of upper respiratory infection (65 cases, 10.9%) was the highest, followed by diarrhea (20 cases, 3.3%), and nausea (18 cases, 3.0%). 109 subjects reported 71 events of adverse drug reactions, and the most common reaction was nausea in 2.33% of the subjects. Thirty-one subjects reported serious adverse events, none of them were considered drug related. From the total of 600 subjects, excluding 48 subjects who were ‘effectiveness unassessable’ by investigators, 552 patients were eligible for the subjective effectiveness analysis. 459 (83.2%) were evaluated as ‘improved’. Proportion of subjects whose human immunodeficiency virus-RNA is <50 copies/ml was 61.2% (309/505) at the beginning of observation and increased to 91.9% (464/505) at the end of study period. Conclusions: The post-marketing surveillance showed the safety of Kivexa in HIV-1 patients in Korea. Ischemic cardiovascular events and hypersensitivity associated with Kivexa were few. There was no significant new safety information. This data may be helpful in implementing Kivexa and lamivudine/abacavir sulfate containing drugs in Korea.;https://icjournal.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3947/ic.2019.51.2.150;3.1;3.4;2.9;20932340;;;

All rights reserved.Introduction: Bali is a famous tourism destination in Indonesia, and many international travelers from several foreign countries visit Bali. A large number of human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) infections was found; however, the genotypes of HIV-1 strains circulating in Bali has not yet been elucidated in detail. In addition, the information on HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) in Bali is limited. Material and methods: HIV-1 pol gene encoding 31 proteases (PR gene) and 37 reverse transcriptase (RT gene) as well as 47 gag and 33 env genes were successfully amplified from DNA samples extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells samples of 51 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced and 7 ART-naïve HIV-1-infected individuals residing in Gianyar and Denpasar, Bali. Genotyping analyses were then performed. The assessment of drug resistance mutations was based on the guidelines published by the International Antiviral Society-United States of America (IAS-USA). Results: The major HIV-1 subtype detected in this study was CRF01-AE (94.5%). Recombinant viruses containing CRF01-AE and subtype B genes (5.5%) were also detected. Drug resistance-Associated major mutations were detected in 8/31 (25.8%) of RT genes but not in PR genes in integrated proviral DNA derived from ART-experienced individuals. However, drug resistance-Associated minor mutations were frequently detected in PR genes derived from most samples. Conclusions: This study revealed that CRF01-AE was the predominant HIV-1 subtype in Bali, Indonesia. In addition, the emergence of drug resistance mutations was evident in proviral DNA derived from ART-experienced individuals, indicating that continuous surveillance is needed in order to monitor the emergence of HIVDR and new viral subtypes in Indonesia.";https://www.termedia.pl/doi/10.5114/hivar.2018.76375;0.6;0.4;0.5;17301270;;;

Alternative formulations with acceptable palatability and convenient dosing are needed for children who require smaller doses and have difficulty swallowing tablets. Setting: A phase 1, open-label, randomized study was conducted in healthy adults to evaluate the relative bioavailability of a novel dispersible FDC tablet of abacavir 150 mg/dolutegravir 10 mg/ lamivudine 75 mg administered under 4 different dosing conditions compared with dolutegravir plus abacavir/lamivudine nondispersible, film-coated tablets. Methods: The test treatments were 4 dispersible FDC tablets reconstituted in water with high- or zero-mineral content and administered either immediately or after a 30-minute delay. The reference treatment was 4 nondispersible dolutegravir 10-mg tablets plus 1 nondispersible abacavir 600-mg/lamivudine 300-mg tablet administered with zero-mineral content water. The primary endpoints were area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity and the maximum observed plasma concentration. Results: Following administration of dispersible abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine, the relative bioavailability of dolutegravir was approximately 50% higher. Abacavir and lamivudine demonstrated bioequivalence when administered as the dispersible FDC tablet compared with coadministration of dolutegravir plus abacavir/ lamivudine nondispersible, film-coated tablets. Neither the mineral content of the water nor dosing times affected the pharmacokinetics of individual components. The dispersible tablet was safe and well tolerated, and the palatability was acceptable. Conclusions: These pharmacokinetic results support further development of a dispersible FDC tablet of abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine for future use in pediatric patients.;http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201812150-00014;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

We need an improved understanding of specific ART-related ADRs that influence virologic outcomes. Objective: To investigate the frequency of clinical ADRs and assess their effect on virologic failure in patients on ART. Method: We described the prevalence of major clinical ADRs, and the association between specific ADRs and virologic failure in a clinic cohort of HIV-1 infected Nigerians aged 18 years, on first-line ART between June 2004 and February 2012. Multivariable logistic regression was run to identify predictors of virologic failure at 24 and 72 weeks of ART. Results: Data of 12,115 patients with a median age of 34 (interquartile range: 29-41) years, and predominantly females (67%) were evaluated. Overall, 957 (7.9%) patients experienced at least one ADR during a median follow-up period of 4 years (interquartile range: 1-7). The three most prevalent ADRs were lipodystrophy (2.6%), anemia (1.9%), and skin rash (0.7%). Virologic failure rate was 36% and 34% at 24 and 72 weeks of ART, respectively. Anemia independently predicted the odds of virologic failure at 72 weeks of ART (adjusted odds ratio, 1.74; 95% CI: 1.2-2.51); adjusted for sex, age, pre-treatment CD4+ cell count, antiretroviral regimen, and medication refill adherence. Conclusion: Antiretroviral therapy-associated anemia increases the likelihood of late virologic failure. We recommend routine monitoring of hemoglobin levels and prompt management of anemia in all patients on ART as a strategy to improve virologic success rates.";http://www.eurekaselect.com/169987/article;2.7;2.4;2.3;1570162X;;;

Determining the potential factors associated with the size of the HIV-1 DNA reservoir benefits the surveillance of disease progression and antiretroviral treatments. Methods: We conducted a case control study to explore the factors that may affect the level of HIV-1 DNA. The level of HIV-1 total DNA in peripheral blood at 5 time points was quantified by quantitative PCR. Chronically HIV-1-infected patients whose cell-associated HIV-1 DNA levels were below the detection limit after receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) for 96 weeks were identified (group 1), and patients who still had detectable levels of cell-associated HIV-1 DNA after ATR treatment were used as the control (group 2). Results: Twenty-one patients with ultralow levels of cell-associated HIV-1 DNA [<20 copies/106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)] presented with a lower CD8+ T-cell count (average: 511 ± 191 versus 715 ± 256 cells/L, p = 0.013) and a higher CD4/CD8 ratio (average: 1.04 ± 0.37 versus 0.72 ± 0.32, respectively, p = 0.002) at week 96. In the multivariate analysis, patients with a higher CD4/CD8 ratio at week 96 were more likely to have levels of HIV-1 DNA below the detection limit (per 0.1 increase, OR = 1.29, 95% CI, 1.05-1.59, p = 0.017). Conclusion: After matching baseline HIV-1 DNA levels, a higher CD4/CD8 ratio at week 96 was the only factor associated with an ultralow level of HIV-1 DNA. The CD4/CD8 ratio can be used as an easy biomarker to help monitor patients on ART who will be selected to participate in eradication studies.;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2866-y;4.5;4.3;4.1;;771;;

Patients and methods: Subjects were 10836 adults who initiated first-line cART (two nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors+efavirenz, a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor or an integrase inhibitor) from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2014. Cox proportional hazards models with multiple adjustment and propensity score matching were used to investigate the effect of baseline HIV-1 RNA and time to virological suppression on the occurrence of virological rebound. Results: During 411436 patient-months of follow-up, risk of virological rebound was higher in patients with baseline HIV-1 RNA 100000 copies/mL versus < 100000 copies/mL, in those achieving virological suppression in.6months versus, 6months, and lower with efavirenz or integrase inhibitors than with ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors. Baseline HIV-1 RNA > 100000 copies/mL was associated with virological rebound for ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors but not for efavirenz or integrase inhibitors. Time to virological suppression > 6 months was strongly associated with virological rebound for all regimens. Conclusions: In HIV-1-infected patients starting cART, risk of virological rebound was lower with efavirenz or integrase inhibitors than with ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors. These data, from a very large observational cohort, in addition to the more rapid initial virological suppression obtained with integrase inhibitors, reinforce the positioning of this class as the preferred one for first-line therapy.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/72/12/3425/4106332;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

Specific recent pharmacologic advancements include 1) the second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitors (dolutegravir and bictegravir) that consistently show less side effects, high tolerability, minimal drug interactions, and rapid rates of HIV viral load decline and 2) tenofovir alafenamide, a prodrug of tenofovir that concentrates in lymphoid tissue and minimizes off target effects. Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide or B/F/TAF is a recently approved fixed dose combination that incorporates these new advancements in the management of HIV.

Although there has been great progress in HIV care, universal HBV vaccination and care is lacking. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of HBV, HBV genotypes, and drug resistance mutations in dual infected cases in a cohort of HIV patients in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A total of 308 HIV-1 positive patients were enrolled into the study and tested for HBsAg in plasma. In HBsAg positive samples, HBV DNA was analyzed for HBV genotype using in-house nested PCR with HBV-specific pre-core / core or surface primers, and for HBV drug resistance mutations (DRMs) in polymerase region. Odds ratio at 95% confidence interval was calculated. Results Of the 308 HIV-positive subjects, 62.7% were female, median age 38 years (range 18–68, IQR: 27–49), and the median CD4 count 405 cells/l (IQR: 75–734). Overall, 94.2% were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) frequently with combinations of Zidovudine (AZT)- Lamivudine (3TC)—Nevirapine (NVP). HBsAg was detected in 5.5% (95%CI 2.95–8.08%) of the study participants, of which the majority were infected with HBV genotype A (7A, 2E, 2D, 1C, 1 G). All HIV/HBV positive cases were on ART with anti-HBV activity (i.e., 3TC) and 3TC associated HBV DRMs (i.e., rtV173L, rtL180M, and rtM204V) were detected in 7/13 (53.8%) subjects. Conclusion In this cross-sectional study of HIV-infected individuals, we found 5.5% HBV/HIV co-infected cases. Most were receiving the first generation anti-HBV therapy with a low genetic barrier to resistance, and several carried mutations associated with anti-HBV (3TC) drug resistance. These data underscore the importance of integrating HBV screening to the HIV treatment guidelines for better management and prevention of HBV-related liver disease.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0190149;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0190149;;

Sustaining >90% virologic suppression in sub-Saharan Africa requires decentralized care and prevention services to rural communities. In Zimbabwe, the number of people receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) has increased rapidly. However, access to treatment monitoring tools such as viral load and drug resistance testing is limited. We assessed virologic treatment outcomes among ART recipients in Nyamutora, a rural community receiving bimonthly ART and prevention services. We enrolled all ART recipients (143) at 6-monthly visits in the Nyamutora community in 2014 and 2015. Whole blood samples were collected in K-EDTA tubes, transported to Harare for CD4 counts and viral load testing, and genotype was obtained in participants with viral loads >1,000 copies/ml. Ages ranged from 2 to 75 years (median 43 years) with a median 42 months on ART at follow-up. Eight of 143 (6%) had viral loads >1,000 copies/ml at one of the 3 visits, 7 on first-line nevirapine (NVP)-based ART and 1 on second-line LPV/r-based ART. Seven participants had sequence data available, and five had drug resistance mutations, K65R, T69N, K101E, K103N, Y181C/I, M184V, and G190A. Virologic failure (p = .001) and drug resistance mutations (p = .01) on first-line NVP-based ART were associated with younger age by univariate exact logistic regression. The participants had high viral suppression (94%) despite less than optimal (NVP based) ART regimens without laboratory monitoring. Virologic failure and drug resistance were higher among children and adolescents. Effective ART delivery to the community achieved high rates of virologic suppression and minimal drug resistance.;http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2017.0029;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of HIV genotypic drug resistance in HIV-1-infected patients with virological failure to STRs in southern Taiwan. Patients and methods: This retrospective study investigated drug resistance in patients with virological failure to STR from January 2016 to September 2017. Antiretroviral resistance mutations were defined using the 2017 International AIDS Society-USA HIV drug resistance algorithm, and drug resistance was compared using the HIVdb program of the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database. Variables between resistance and non-resistance groups were compared. Results: Thirty-nine HIV-1-infected patients with treatment failure were tested for resistance, of whom 89% were infected by men who have sex with men. Subtype B HIV-1 strains were found in 90% of the patients. Eight patients were treatment naïve and initiated STRs, while 31 patients experienced treatment failure after switching to STRs. Eighty-seven percent of the patients harbored any of four classes of resistance (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), and integrase strand transfer inhibitors). The prevalence rates of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, PI, and integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance were 72%, 82%, 10%, and 3%, respectively. Patients with PI resistance were more likely to respond to treatment with a non-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine/efavirenz-based STR (P=0.004) and a longer duration of antiretroviral therapy (101 months [72.0–123.3] vs 11 months [7–44], P=0.007). There were no associations between different STRs and transmission risk factors, HIV subtype, duration of antiretroviral therapy, and resistance to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Conclusion: A high rate of antiretroviral drug resistance was found in the patients who failed STR treatment. The presence of PI resistance in these patients represented an inappropriate switch from a multiple tablet regimen to an STR. These findings should remind clinicians that detailed drug resistance history and close monitoring are mandatory after switching to an STR.;https://www.dovepress.com/hiv-1-genotypic-drug-resistance-in-patients-with-virological-failure-t-peer-reviewed-article-IDR;6.6;2.8;2.4;;;;

We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study to evaluate the virologic suppression rate among patients on ART for 6 months in five hospitals around Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Methods Plasma VL was measured and patients with VL <1,000 copies/mL were defined as virologically suppressed. A second VL test was performed within at least six months of the first test. Factors associated with virologic suppression were analyzed using logistic regression models accounting for site-level clustering using complex survey procedures. Results Data were analyzed for 2,313 patients on ART for six months or longer between July 2013 and February 2015. Among them, 1,563 (67.6%) achieved virologic suppression at the first VL test. A second VL test was performed within at least six months for 718 (31.0%) of the patients. Of the 459 patients with an initial HIV-1 RNA <1,000 copies/mL who had a second VL performed, 394 (85.8%) maintained virologic suppression. Virologic suppression was negatively associated with male gender (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.74–0.0.86), 23 to 35 months on ART (aOR:0.72[0.54–0.96]), baseline CD4 counts of 201–500 cells/mm3 and 200 cells/mm3 or lower (aORs: 0.77 [0.62–0.95] and 0.80 [0.66–0.98], respectively), poor adherence (aOR: 0.69 [0.59–0.81]), and TB co-infection (aOR: 0.73 [0.55–0.97]). Conclusions This study showed that over two-thirds of the patients in this evaluation achieved virologic suppression after six months on ART and the majority of them remained suppressed. These results reinforce the importance of expanding access to HIV-1 viral load testing in Haiti for monitoring ART outcomes.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0192077;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0192077;;

We investigated the efficacy and safety of switching to a single-tablet regimen of darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide versus continuing a regimen of boosted protease inhibitor, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Methods: EMERALD was a phase-3, randomised, active-controlled, open-label, international, multicentre trial, done at 106 sites across nine countries in North America and Europe. HIV-1-infected adults were eligible to participate if they were treatment-experienced and virologically suppressed (viral load <50 copies per mL for 2 months; one viral load of 50–200 copies per mL was allowed within 12 months before screening), and patients with a history of virological failure on non-darunavir regimens were allowed. Randomisation was by computer-generated interactive web-response system and stratified by boosted protease inhibitor use at baseline. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to switch to the open-label study regimen or continue the control regimen. The study regimen consisted of a fixed-dose tablet containing darunavir 800 mg, cobicistat 150 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir alafenamide 10 mg, which was taken once per day for 48 weeks. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with virological rebound (confirmed viral load 50 copies per mL or premature discontinuations, with last viral load 50 copies per mL) cumulative through week 48; we tested non-inferiority (4% margin) of the study regimen versus the control regimen in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02269917. Findings: The study began on April 1, 2015, and the cutoff date for the week 48 primary analysis was Feb 24, 2017. Of 1141 patients (763 in the study group and 378 in the control group), 664 (58%) had previously received five or more antiretrovirals, including screening antiretrovirals, and 169 (15%) had previous virological failure on a non-darunavir regimen. The study regimen was non-inferior to the control for virological rebound cumulative through week 48 (19 [2·5%] of 763 patients in the study group vs eight (2·1%) of 378 patients in the control group; difference 0·4%, 95% CI 1·5 to 2·2; p<0·0001). No resistance to any study drug was observed. Numbers of discontinuations related to adverse events (11 [1%] of 763 patients in the study group vs four [1%] of 378 patients in the control group) and grade 3–4 adverse events (52 [7%] patients vs 31 [8%] patients) were similar between the two groups. There was a small non-clinically relevant but statistically significant (0·2 [SD 1·1] vs 0·1 [1·1], p=0.010) difference between the two groups in change from baseline in total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratio. Only one serious adverse event (pancreatitis in the study group) was deemed as possibly related to the study regimen.

Efficacy and safety of a Day-on, Day-off (DODO) schedule of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine and efavirenz (FTC/TDF/EFV) single tablet regimen (STR) was assessed. Twenty-seven patients were prescribed the DODO schedule and were monitored for 48 weeks. Switching criteria were: no previous ART failure, no AIDS-defining illnesses, T CD4 cell nadir >200/mm 3 , and HIV-RNA below detection limit (40 copies/mL) for at least six months. Clinical and laboratory data, including plasma HIV-RNA levels, T CD4 and CD8 counts, liver and kidney function, lipid levels and ultrasensitive C-reactive protein (us-CRP) were assessed at baseline, week 4, 12, 24, and 48. Statistical analysis was performed by paired Student’s T-test for comparison between baseline and each time point, and Chi square test for CD4/CD8 ratio comparison. In all, 26 out of 27 patients maintained plasma HIV-RNA levels below the detection limit through the entire follow-up. One patient experienced low level plasma HIV-RNA rebound at week 36 (47 copies/ml) and immediately reverted to the conventional dose schedule of FTC/TDF/EFV; plasma HIV-RNA was undetectable after four weeks. No major changes on liver and kidney function tests, lipid levels and us-CRP were observed. Although no profound modifications of T CD4 count were observed during follow-up, the CD4/ CD8 ratio increased significantly at week 48 compared to the baseline (p<0.05). In conclusion, 48-week DODO administration of the fixed dose FTC/TDF/EFV STR combination was safe and effective in maintaining HIV viral replication below the detection limit in a selected group of HIV-1-infected individuals.";None;1.1;1.4;1.7;11249390;;;

PA-824 a new chemical entity and a member of a class of compounds known as nitroimidazo-oxazines, has significant antituberculosis activity and a unique mechanism of action. Darunavir (PrezistaTM) is a new protease inhibitor of HIV-1. A simple, sensitive and rapid LC-MSMS method has been developed and validated for simultaneous determination of PA-824 and darunavir. Chromatographic separation was achieved on Agilent Eclipse plus C18 column (100mm × 2.1 mm, 3.5 m) using gradient elution of acetonitrile-water (90:10, v/v) with fast gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min and run time of 4.5 min. The mass spectrometer was run in positive electrospray ionization mode using multiple reaction monitoring to monitor the mass transitions. The method was validated for accuracy, precision, linearity, range, selectivity, lower limit of quantification, recovery and matrix effect. All validation parameters met the acceptance criteria according to regulatory guidelines. The method had been successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of fixed dose administration of PA-824, darunavir and their combination in rats. The results indicated that when co-administration of darunavir could decrease the amount of PA-824 in vivo and extend the elimination half-life.;https://academic.oup.com/chromsci/article/56/4/327/4823222;2.1;2.5;2.6;00219665;;;

HTLV-1 is transmitted through prolonged breast-feeding, by sexual contacts and by transmission of infected T lymphocytes through blood transfusion. One to ten percent of infected carriers will develop a severe HTLV-1-associated disease: Adult-T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), or a neurological disorder named Tropical Spastic Paraparesis/HTLV-1 Associated Myelopathy (TSP/HAM). In vivo, HTLV-1 is mostly detected in CD4+ T-cells, and to a lesser extent in CD8+ T cells and dendritic cells. There is a strong correlation between HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) and clinical status of infected individuals. Thus, reducing PVL could be part of a strategy to prevent or treat HTLV-1-associated diseases among carriers. Treatment of ATLL patients using conventional chemotherapy has very limited benefit. Some chronic and acute ATLL patients are, however, efficiently treated with a combination of interferon  and zidovudine (IFN-/AZT), to which arsenic trioxide is added in some cases. On the other hand, no efficient treatment for TSP/HAM patients has been described yet. It is therefore crucial to develop therapies that could either prevent the occurrence of HTLV-1-associated diseases or at least block the evolution of the disease in the early stages. In vivo, reverse transcriptase (RT) activity is low in infected cells, which is correlated with a clonal mode of viral replication. This renders infected cells resistant to nucleoside RT inhibitors such as AZT. However, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) associated to AZT efficiently induces viral expression and prevent de novo cellular infection. In asymptomatic STLV-1 infected non-human primates, HDACi/AZT combination allows a strong decrease in the PVL. Unfortunately, rebound in the PVL occurs when the treatment is stopped, highlighting the need for better antiviral compounds. Here, we review previously used strategies targeting HTLV-1 replication. We also tested a series of HIV-1 RT inhibitors in an in vitro anti-HTLV-1 screen, and report that bis-POM-PMEA (adefovir dipivoxil) and bis-POC-PMPA (tenofovir disoproxil) are much more efficient compared to AZT to decrease HTLV-1 cell-to-cell transmission in vitro. Our results suggest that revisiting already established antiviral drugs is an interesting approach to discover new anti-HTLV-1 drugs.;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00278/full;5.0;5.6;6.4;;278;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Increased access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) by human immunodeficiency virus postive (HIV+) individuals has become a reality worldwide. In Brazil, HAART currently reaches over half of HIV-infected subjects. In the context of a remarkable HIV-1 genetic variability, highly related variants, called quasispecies, are generated. HIV quasispecies generated during infection can influence virus persistence and pathogenicity, representing a challenge to treatment. However, the clinical relevance of minority quasispecies is still uncertain. In this study, we have determined the archived proviral sequences, viral subtype and drug resistance mutations from a cohort of HIV+ patients with undetectable viral load undergoing HAART as first-line therapy using next-generation sequencing for near full-length virus genome (NFLG) assembly. HIV-1 consensus sequences representing NFLG were obtained for eleven patients, while for another twelve varying genome coverage rates were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis showed the predominance of subtype B (83%, 19/23). Considering the minority variants, 18 patients carried archived virus harboring at least one mutation conferring antiretroviral resistance, for six patients, the mutations correlated with the current ARVs used. These data highlight the importance of monitoring HIV minority drug resistant variants and their clinical impact, to guide future regimen switches and improve HIV treatment success.;http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/9/12/392;5.8;5.3;4.3;;392;;

Methods A study was conducted on HIV-1-infected antiretroviral-naïve patients from 6 Spanish or French centers, who were started on treatment with STR-Atripla ® , or the same components separately (MTR-SC), or a different MTR (MTR-Other). Effectiveness was measured as percentage of HIV-RNA <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks (ITT). Efficiency was the ratio between costs (direct cost of antiretrovirals plus outpatient visits, hospital admissions, and resistance tests) and effectiveness. Results The study included a total of 2773 patients (759 STR-Atripla ® , 483 MTR-SC, and 1531 MTR-Other). Median age was 37 years, 15% were HCV co-infected, 27% had a CD4+ count <200 cells/L, and 30% had viral load 100.000 copies/mL. The duration of the assigned treatment was longer for STR-Atripla ® (P <.0001). Response rates (adjusted for CD4+ count, viral load, and clustered on hospitals) at 48 weeks were 76%, 74%, and 62%, respectively (P <.0001). Virological failure was more common in MTR patients (P =.0025), and interruptions due to intolerance with MTR-Other (P <.0001). Cost per responder at 48 weeks (efficiency) was €12,406 with STR-Atripla ® , €11,034 with MTR-SC (0.89 [0.82, 0.99] times lower), and €18,353 (1.48 [1.38, 1.61] times higher) with MTR-Other. Conclusions STR-Atripla ® and MTR-SC regimens showed similar effectiveness, but virological failure rate was lower with STR-Atripla. MTR-SC, considered less convenient, had a marginally better efficiency, mainly due to lower direct costs. MTR-Other regimens had both a worse effectiveness and efficiency. Similar efficiency analyses adjusting for baseline characteristics should be recommended for new STRs.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0213005X16302361;1.8;1.7;1.7;0213005X;;;

All Rights Reserved.Therapeutic strategies aimed at achieving antiretroviral therapy (ART)-free HIV remission in infected individuals are under active investigation. Considering the vast majority of HIV-infected individuals experience plasma viral rebound upon cessation of therapy, clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of curative strategies would likely require inclusion of ART interruption. However, it is unclear what impact short-term analytical treatment interruption (ATI) and subsequent reinitiation of ART have on immunologic and virologic parameters of HIV-infected individuals. Here, we show a significant increase of HIV burden in the CD4+T cells of infected individuals during ATI that was correlated with the level of plasma viral rebound. However, the size of the HIV reservoirs as well as immune parameters, including markers of exhaustion and activation, returned to pre-ATI levels 6–12 months after the study participants resumed ART. Of note, the proportions of near full-length, genome-intact and structurally defective HIV proviral DNA sequences were similar prior to ATI and following reinitiation of ART. In addition, there was no evidence of emergence of antiretroviral drug resistance mutations within intact HIV proviral DNA sequences following reinitiation of ART. These data demonstrate that short-term ATI does not necessarily lead to expansion of the persistent HIV reservoir nor irreparable damages to the immune system in the peripheral blood, warranting the inclusion of ATI in future clinical trials evaluating curative strategies.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006792;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;e1006792;;

Objective: Here we provide molecular data for HIVDR in the CRF01_AE subtype in Bali, Indonesia. Method: Seventy patients were enrolled in this study and grouped into treatment failure and treatment naïve groups. The full-length pol gene was amplified using nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and the product was then sequenced. The readable sequence was then subjected to Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database genotyping. Results: We found that clinical classification was in accordance with the presence of HIVDR markers in the pol gene. Independent of therapy history, the treatment failure group showed resistance markers against nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), ranging from 72%–100% of patients. Only a small proportion of naïve patients harbored HIV with drug resistance markers to NNRTI. No protease inhibitor-resistant marker was found in either patient group. Molecular marker mutations, which were found in more than 50% of treatment failure patients, were M184V (100%), T215A/Y/F (88.2%), D67N/G (76.5%), and M41L (58.8%). Conclusion: The protocol used in this study to determine genetic markers of HIVDR based on subtype B can be applied for the rapid determination of resistance of the CRF01_AE subtype. All patients with progressive clinical signs and increased viral load should be recommended to undergo second-line treatment of the ARV regimen.;http://www.eurekaselect.com/169583/article;2.7;2.4;2.3;1570162X;;;

We aimed to compare safety and efficacy of tenofovir alafenamide plus emtricitabine with that of abacavir plus lamivudine. Methods: In this randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, non-inferiority phase 3 trial, HIV-1-positive adults (18 years) were screened at 79 sites in 11 countries in North America and Europe. Eligible participants were virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) and on a stable three-drug regimen containing abacavir plus lamivudine. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated allocation sequence (block size 4) to switch to fixed-dose tablets of tenofovir alafenamide (10 mg or 25 mg) plus emtricitabine (200 mg) or remain on abacavir (600 mg) plus lamivudine (300 mg), with matching placebo, while continuing to take the third drug. Randomisation was stratified by the third drug (boosted protease inhibitor vs other drug) at screening. Investigators, participants, and study staff giving treatment, assessing outcomes, and collecting data were masked to treatment group. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with virological suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) at week 48 (assessed by snapshot algorithm), with a 10% non-inferiority margin. We analysed the primary endpoint in participants enrolled before May 23, 2016 (when target sample size was reached), and we analysed safety in all enrolled participants who received at least one dose of study drug (including patients enrolled after these dates). This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02469246. Findings: Study enrolment began on June 29, 2015, and the cutoff enrolment date for the week 48 primary endpoint analysis was May 23, 2016. 501 participants were randomly assigned and treated. At week 48, virological suppression was maintained in 227 (90%) of 253 participants receiving tenofovir alafenamide plus emtricitabine compared with 230 (93%) of 248 receiving abacavir plus lamivudine (difference 3·0%, 95% CI 8·2 to 2·0), showing non-inferiority. Few participants discontinued treatment because of adverse events: 12 (4%) of 280 participants in the tenofovir alafenimide plus emtricitabine group and nine (3%) of 276 in the abacavir plus lamivudine group. Three participants had serious, treatment-related adverse events: one each with renal colic and neutropenia in the tenofovir alafenamide plus emtricitabine group, and one myocardial infarction in the abacavir plus lamivudine group. There were no treatment-related deaths. Interpretation: Tenofovir alafenamide, in combination with emtricitabine and various third drugs, maintained high efficacy with a renal and bone safety profile similar to that of abacavir. In virologically suppressed patients, a regimen containing tenofovir alafenamide could be an alternative to those containing abacavir, without concern for new onset of renal or bone toxicities or hyperlipidaemia.

Methods: Data were analysed for 5678 EuroSIDA-enrolled patients starting a DRV/r-, ATZ/r- or LPV/r-containing regimen between 1 January 2000 and 30 June 2013. Separate analyses were performed for the following subgroups of patients: (1) ART-naïve subjects (8%) at ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) initiation; (2) ART-experienced individuals (44%) initiating the new PI/r with a viral load (VL) 500 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL; and (3) ART-experienced patients (48%) initiating the new PI/r with a VL >500 copies/mL. Virological failure (VF) was defined as two consecutive VL measurements >200 copies/mL 24 weeks after PI/r initiation. Kaplan–Meier and multivariable Cox models were used to compare risks of failure by PI/r-based regimen. The main analysis was performed with intention-to-treat (ITT) ignoring treatment switches. Results: The time to VF favoured DRV/r over ATZ/r, and both were superior to LPV/r (log-rank test; P < 0.02) in all analyses. Nevertheless, the risk of VF in ART-naïve patients was similar regardless of the PI/r initiated after controlling for potential confounders. The risk of VF in both treatment-experienced groups was lower for DRV/r than for ATZ/r, which, in turn, was lower than for LPV/r-based ART. Conclusions: Although confounding by indication and calendar year cannot be completely ruled out, in ART-experienced subjects the long-term effectiveness of DRV/r-containing regimens appears to be greater than that of ATZ/r and LPV/r.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hiv.12581;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;

Samples from 417 patients in Uganda were analyzed for predicted drug resistance upon failing a first- (N = 158), second- (N = 121), or third-line [all 51 involving Raltegravir (RAL)] treatment regimen. HIV-1 pol gene was amplified and sequenced from plasma samples. Drug susceptibility was interpreted using the Stanford HIV database algorithm and SCUEAL was used for HIV-1 subtyping. Frequency of resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (95%) and non-NRTI (NNRTI, 96%) was high in first-line treatment failures. Despite lack of NNRTI-based treatment for years, NNRTI resistance remained stable in 55% of patients failing second-line or third-line treatment, and was also at 10% in treatment-naive Ugandans. DTG resistance (n = 366) was not observed in treatment-naive individuals or individuals failing first- and second-line cART, and only found in two patients failing third-line cART, while 47% of the latter had RAL- and Elvitegravir-resistant HIV-1. Secondary mutations associated with DTG resistance were found in 2%-10% of patients failing third-line cART. Of 14 drugs currently available for cART in Uganda, resistance was readily observed to all antiretroviral drugs (except for DTG) in Ugandan patients failing first-, second-, or even third-line treatment regimens. The high NNRTI resistance in first-line treatment in Uganda even among treatment-naive patients calls for the use of DTG to reach the UNAIDS 90:90:90 goals.;http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2017.0205;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

Understanding the patterns of HIV drug resistance in pregnant women might help in tailoring optimal regimens for prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (pMTCT) and antenatal care. Objectives To describe the frequency and characteristics of HIV drug resistance mutations (HIVDRM) in pregnant women with virological failure at delivery, despite pMTCT or antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods Samples from HIV-infected pregnant women from a rural area in southern Mozambique were analysed. Only women with HIV-1 RNA >400c/mL at delivery were included in the analysis. HIVDRM were determined using MiSeq® (detection threshold 1%) at the first antenatal care (ANC) visit and at the time of delivery. Results Ninety and 60 samples were available at the first ANC visit and delivery, respectively. At first ANC, 97% of the women had HIV-1 RNA>400c/mL, 39% had CD4+ counts <350 c/mm3 and 30% were previously not on ART. Thirteen women (14%) had at least one HIVDRM of whom 70% were not on previous ART. Eight women (13%) had at least one HIVDRM at delivery. Out of 37 women with data available from the two time points, 8 (21%) developed at least one new HIVDRM during pMTCT or ART. Twenty seven per cent (53/191), 32% (44/ 138) and 100% (5/5) of the mutations that were present at enrolment, delivery and that emerged during pregnancy, respectively, were minority mutations (frequency <20%). Conclusions Even with ultrasensitive HIV-1 genotyping, less than 20% of women with detectable viremia at delivery had HIVDRM before initiating pMTCT or ART. This suggests that factors other than pre-existing resistance, such as lack of adherence or interruptions of the ANC chain, are also relevant to explain lack of virological suppression at the time of delivery in women receiving antiretrovirals drugs during pregnancy.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196451;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0196451;;

Study A4001031 was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of maraviroc in combination with optimized background therapy in treatment-experienced pediatric patients infected with R5 HIV-1 and support registration of maraviroc for pediatric use. Methods: This is an open-label, 2-stage, age-stratified, noncomparative multicenter study. One-hundred and three participants were enrolled into 4 age/formulation cohorts and dosed twice daily. Initial doses were determined by body surface area and optimized background therapy, based on drug interactions with maraviroc in adults. Dose adjustment and pharmacokinetic reevaluation occurred if the average concentrations (Cavg) at Week 2 were <100 ng/mL (Stage 1 - dose finding). Results: Data from the Week 48 analysis demonstrated that 49/50 Stage 1 participants rolling over into Stage 2 (safety and efficacy) achieved Cavg 100 ng/mL. Doses were identified that achieved similar concentration ranges to those seen in adults. The majority (90/103) received optimized background therapy containing potent cytochrome P450 3A inhibitors. Maraviroc was well tolerated and the safety and efficacy were comparable to those of adults. All cohorts had a mean decrease from baseline in HIV-1 RNA of >1 log10. Increases from baseline in the median CD4+ cell count and percentage were seen for all age groups. Conclusions: The maraviroc dosing strategy resulted in participants achieving the target Cavg, with exposure ranges similar to those observed in adults on approved doses. The safety and efficacy of maraviroc in this pediatric population were comparable to those seen in adults.;http://journals.lww.com/00006454-201805000-00019;4.7;4.4;3.9;08913668;;;

The objective of this study was to evaluate factors associated with unsuppressed VL (VL > 400 copies/ml) in patients currently in care on first-line ART for  6 months attending South African public healthcare facilities. We analysed electronic medical records of ART patients with a VL result on record who started ART between January 2004 and April 2016 from 271 public health facilities. We present descriptive and multivariable logistic regression for unsuppressed VL at last visit using a priori variables. We included 244,370 patients (69% female) on first-line ART in April 2016 for  6 months. Median age at ART start was 33 years (7% were < 15 years old). Median duration on ART was 3.7 years. Adjusting for other variables, factors associated with having an unsuppressed VL at the most recent visit among patients in care included: (1) < 15 years old at ART start (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=2.58; 95% CI = 2.37, 2.81) versus 15–49 years at ART start, (2) male gender (aOR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.25, 1.35), (3) 6–12 months on ART versus longer (aOR = 1.34; 95% CI = 1.29, 1.40), (4) on tuberculosis (TB) treatment (aOR = 1.78; 95% CI = 1.48, 2.13), and (5) prior ART exposure versus none (aOR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.08, 1.32). Approximately 85% of the ART cohort who were in care had achieved viral suppression, though men, youth/adolescents, patients with prior ART exposure, those with short duration of ART, and patients on TB treatment had increased odds of not achieving viral suppression. There is a need to develop and evaluate targeted interventions for ART patients in care who are at high risk of unsuppressed VL.";http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956462417748859;2.5;2.5;2.7;09564624;;;

Effective virologic control can often be achieved with once-daily use of a single-tablet regimen. Over the past three years, ART drug development has focused on the next generation of fixed-dose combinations for initial and maintenance therapy with improved efficacy, safety and tolerability. Areas covered: This review covers pre-clinical and clinical data searched through PubMed and presented at major conferences through November 2017. Expert opinion: Currently available single-tablet regimens have clinical limitations related to adverse event profiles, drug-drug and drug-food interactions and variable barriers to resistance. Anticipated advances in ART fixed-dose combinations promise combinations of current multiple tablet regimens into single tablets, as well as combinations with novel drugs with improved safety and tolerability. The traditional dogma of effective ART containing at least three active antiretroviral drugs is being challenged by promising data to support efficacy of certain regimens containing two drugs. Implementation of next generation ART will bring to light issues of clinical preference and cost-effectiveness as patents of existing drugs expire and more generic formulations become available.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14656566.2018.1450866;5.7;5.6;4.9;14656566;;;

Clinical trials of initial antiretroviral therapy (ART) and switch studies involving bictegravir/ emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide were presented. Intensification of initial ART with integrase strand transfer inhibitors did not increase the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Pharmacokinetic issues were discussed, including the substantial drugdrug interactions between efavirenz-based ART and hormonal contraception delivered via a vaginal ring. Studies on pre-ART drug resistance and emergence of drug resistance after initial and second-line ART in different settings and populations were highlighted. Novel technologies to identify drug resistance included a free, cloud-based web service for HIV genotyping analysis and a promising technology for point-of-care drug resistance mutations testing. New strategies to improve the HIV care continuum included home-based testing with initiation of same-day ART and stratified care with specialized clinics to serve those disengaged in care, but the data on financial incentives were not encouraging. Several studies provided insights into the impact of early ART on decreasing the size of the HIV reservoir in HIV-infected infants. Pertinent conference findings relating to women’s health issues included similar clinical outcomes between breastfeeding and formula feeding HIV-infected women, the problem of viral rebound and ART nonadherence in pregnancy and postpartum.;None;3.5;4.9;5.5;21615861;;;

In humans and primates, HIV- and SIV-infected CD4 T cells in adipose tissues have recently been identified as reservoirs for infectious virus. To better characterize adipose tissue as a pharmacological sanctuary for HIV-infected cells, in vitro experiments were conducted to assess antiretroviral drug efficacy in the presence of adipocytes, and drug penetration in adipose tissue cells (stromal-vascular-fraction cells and mature adipocytes) was examined in treated humans and monkeys. Co-culture experiments between HIV-1-infected CD4 T cells and primary human adipocytes showed that adipocytes consistently reduced the antiviral efficacy of the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir and its prodrug forms tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). In HIV-infected persons, LC-MS/MS analysis of intracellular lysates derived from adipose tissue stromal-vascular-fraction cells or mature adipocytes suggested that integrase inhibitors penetrate adipose tissue, whereas penetration of nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as TDF, emtricitabine, abacavir, and lamivudine is restricted. The limited distribution and functions of key antiretroviral drugs within fat depots may contribute to viral persistence in adipose tissue.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166354217308264;7.4;7.3;7.4;01663542;;;

FDCs in the cervical lymph nodes (CLNs) are particularly relevant in elucidating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) draining LNs of the central nervous system. The FDC viral reservoir in both peripheral LN and CLN, like the other HIV reservoirs, contribute to both low-level viremia and viral resurgence upon cessation or failure of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Besides prolonged virion retention on FDCs in LNs and CLNs, the suboptimal penetration of cART at these anatomical sites is another factor contributing to establishing and maintaining this viral reservoir. Unlike the FDCs within the peripheral LNs, the CLN FDCs have only recently garnered attention. This interest in CLN FDCs has been driven by detailed characterization of the meningeal lymphatic system. As the CSF drains through the meningeal lymphatics and nasal lymphatics via the cribriform plate, CLN FDCs may acquire HIV after capturing them from T cells, antigen-presenting cells, or cell-free virions. In addition, CD4+ T follicular helper cells within the CLNs are productively infected as a result of acquiring the virus from the FDCs. In this review, we outline the underlying mechanisms of viral accumulation on CLN FDCs and its potential impact on viral resurgence or achieving a cure for HIV infection.;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2018.00805/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;805;;

Design: Multicountry prospective cohort. Methods: Suboptimal immune recovery was defined as proportions of participants who failed to attain clinically relevant CD4+cell count thresholds (>200, >350 and >500 cells/l) despite sustained viral suppression on continuous first-line ART. Participants were censored at the earliest of death, loss to follow-up, last viral load less than 50 copies/ml, or database closure. Determinants of immune recovery were assessed using multivariable Cox regression. We estimated incidence rates of AIDS, pulmonary tuberculosis and all-cause mortality for CD4+strata. Results: One thousand, five hundred and ninety-two participants were included; 60% were women, median age was 37 years (IQR 31-43) and median pre-ART CD4+cell count was 147 cells/l (IQR 76-215). After 6 years of ART, suboptimal immune recovery at CD4+cell counts less than 200 cells/l, less than 350 cells/l, and less than 500 cells/l occurred in 7, 27, and 57% of participants, respectively. Compared with participants with CD4+cell count greater than 500 cells/l, on-ART incidence rates were 12.5, 4.1, 0.9 times higher for AIDS and 16.9, 3.5, and 2.3 times higher for pulmonary tuberculosis in participants with CD4+cell count less than 200, 200-349, and 350-499 cells/l, respectively. All-cause mortality was highest in participants with CD4+cell count less than 200 cells/l, and comparable across the higher CD4+strata. Older age, male sex, and lower pre-ART CD4+cell count were strongly associated with suboptimal immune recovery. Conclusion: These findings warrant close clinical and laboratory monitoring until adequate immune reconstitution is achieved and support early ART initiation before decline of CD4+cell count.";http://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAD.0000000000001801;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

Methods: We performed an observational, retrospective study of HIV-infected patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy who switched to a dual regimen containing lamivudine (3TC) plus darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) 800/100 mg qd or atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) 300/100 mg qd. Results: As a whole, 122 well-treated patients (mean age, 45.2 years; mean CD4 T + lymphocyte count, 589 cells/mm3; mean duration of current cART, 3.1 years) were enrolled. Current antiretroviral regimen included tenofovir/emtricitabine in 91 subjects, abacavir/lamivudine in 25, lopinavir/r in 41, DRV/r in 38 and ATV/r in 33. Baseline mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 94.2 mL/min/1.73 m2, and proteinuria was detected in 46 subjects (38%). Overall 70 subjects switched to 3TC + DRV/r (group A) and 52 to 3TC + ATV/r (group B). After 12 months, 65 patients (92.8%) in group A and 46 (88.4%) in group B showed HIV RNA <20 copies/mL. A significant and comparable increase in eGFR was observed in group A and B (+3.8 and +3.1 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively), such as a significant decrease in prevalence of proteinuria.

Background: Entry inhibitors, such as Maraviroc, bind to CCR5 inhibiting entry of CCR5 utilizing viruses (R5 viruses). In the course of HIV infection, CXCR4 utilizing viruses (X4 viruses) may emerge and outgrow R5 viruses, and potentially limit the effectiveness of Maraviroc. The use of Maraviroc is reserved for salvage therapy in South Africa. Objective: In this study, we examined the frequency of R5 and X4 viruses, using next generation sequencing, in patients under treatment to draw inferences on the utility of Maraviroc in a South African population. Study design: Proviral DNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 72 chronically HIV infected patients on antiretroviral treatment. HIV V3 loop gene was amplified and sequenced on an Illumina MiniSeq platform. Viral subtypes were determined by the jumping profile Hidden Markov Model (jpHMM) and REGA genotyping tools. De Novo consensus sequences were derived for the majority and minority populations for each patient using Geneious ® software version 8.1.5. HIV-1 tropism was inferred using PSSMsinsi, Geno2pheno and Phenoseq-C web-based tools. Results: Quality V3 loop sequences were obtained from 72 patients, with 5 years (range: 0–16) median duration on treatment. Subtypes A1, B and C viruses were identified at frequencies of 4% (3/72), 4% (3/72) and 92% (66/72) respectively. Fifty four percent (39/72) of patients exclusively harboured R5 viral quasispecies; and 21% (15/72) exclusively harbored X4 viral quasispecies. Twenty five percent of patients (18/72) harbored dual/mixture of R5X4 quasispecies. Of these 18 patients, about 28% (5/18) harbored the R5+X4, a mixture with a majority R5 and minority X4 viruses, while about 72% (13/18) harbored the R5X4+ mixture with a majority X4 and minority R5 viruses. The proportion of all patients who harbored X4 viruses either exclusively or dual/mixture was 46% (33/72). Thirty-five percent (23/66) of the patients who were of HIV-1 subtype C harboured X4 viruses ( 2 = 3.58; p =.058), and 57% of these (13/23) harbored X4 viruses exclusively. CD4 + cell count less than 350 cell/l was associated with the presence of X4 viruses ( 2 = 4.99; p =.008). Conclusion: The effectiveness of Maraviroc as a component in salvage therapy may be compromised for a significant number of chronically infected patients harboring CXCR4 utilizing viruses.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1386653218300416;5.7;6.0;5.9;13866532;;;

We assessed associations between HIV-1 status and decreased sexual functioning among MSM. Methods: We used cross-sectional data from 399 HIV-1-infected MSM mostly on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and 366 HIV-1-uninfected MSM aged at least 45 years participating in the AGE h IV Cohort Study. The study questionnaire included questions on erectile function, sexual satisfaction, and sexual desire. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to assess the association between HIV-1 status and these three sexual domains. We also explored HIV-1-related and ART-related parameters in multivariable models among HIV-1-infected participants. Results: Decreased erectile function (13.0 vs. 3.4%, P < 0.001), decreased satisfaction (17.8 vs. 11.8%, P = 0.02), and decreased desire (7.0 vs. 3.6% P = 0.03) were each more prevalent in HIV-1-infected than in HIV-1-uninfected participants. In multivariable models adjusted for age, ethnicity, waist-to-hip ratio, age-associated comorbidities, depression, frailty, use of antihypertensive and antidepressant medication, we found HIV-1 status significantly associated with decreased erectile function [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.53, 95% CI 1.23-5.20], but not with decreased satisfaction (aOR 1.34, 95% CI 0.83-2.16), or decreased desire (aOR 1.77, 95% CI 0.80-3.91). Among HIV-1-infected participants, current exposure (aOR 5.39, 95% CI 2.09-13.92) and cumulative duration of exposure (aOR per year 1.20, 95% CI 1.07-1.35) to lopinavir/ritonavir were significantly associated with decreased erectile function in multivariable analysis. Conclusion: Among MSM aged at least 45 years, HIV-1 status was independently associated with decreased erectile function. Exposure to lopinavir/ritonavir appeared to be an independent risk factor for decreased erectile function among MSM with HIV-1.;http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201806010-00007;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

Sexual contact, particularly men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most prevalent form of HIV transmission in Shijiazhuang. Hence, we conducted an epidemiological surveillance study on TDR among newly diagnosed individuals who infected-HIV through sexual contact in from 2014–2015. Methods Genotypic resistance mutations were defined using the WHO-2009 surveillance list. Potential impact on antiretroviral drug was predicted according to the Stanford HIV db program version 7.0. The role of transmission clusters in drug resistant strains was evaluated by phylogenetic and network analyses. Results In this study, 589 individuals were recruited and 542 samples were amplified and sequenced successfully. The over prevalence of TDR was 6.1%: 1.8% to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 2.0% to non- NRTIs (NNRTIs) and 2.4% to protease inhibitors (PIs), respectively. We did not find significant differences in the TDR prevalence by demographic and clinical characteristics (p > 0.05). Using network and phylogenetic analysis, almost 60.0% sequences were clustered together. Of these clusters, 2 included at least two individuals carrying the same resistance mutation, accounting for 21.2% (7/33) individuals with TDR. No significant difference was observed in the clustering rate between the individuals with and without TDR. Conclusions We obtained a moderate level TDR rate in studied region. These findings enhance our understanding of HIV-1 drug resistance prevalence in Shijiazhuang, and may be helpful for the comprehensive prevention and control of HIV-1.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198005;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0198005;;

All Rights Reserved.The ability of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to detect low frequency HIV-1 drug resistance mutations (DRMs) not detected by dideoxynucleotide Sanger sequencing has potential advantages for improved patient outcomes. We compared the performance of an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) NGS assay, the Sentosa SQ HIV genotyping assay for HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing, with Sanger sequencing on 138 protease/reverse transcriptase (RT) and 39 integrase sequences. The NGS assay used a 5% threshold for reporting low-frequency variants. The level of complete plus partial nucleotide sequence concordance between Sanger sequencing and NGS was 99.9%. Among the 138 protease/RT sequences, a mean of 6.4 DRMs was identified by both Sanger and NGS, a mean of 0.5 DRM was detected by NGS alone, and a mean of 0.1 DRM was detected by Sanger sequencing alone. Among the 39 integrase sequences, a mean of 1.6 DRMs was detected by both Sanger sequencing and NGS and a mean of 0.15 DRM was detected by NGS alone. Compared with Sanger sequencing, NGS estimated higher levels of resistance to one or more antiretroviral drugs for 18.2% of protease/RT sequences and 5.1% of integrase sequences. There was little evidence for technical artifacts in the NGS sequences, but the G-to-A hypermutation was detected in three samples. In conclusion, the IVD NGS assay evaluated in this study was highly concordant with Sanger sequencing. At the 5% threshold for reporting minority variants, NGS appeared to attain a modestly increased sensitivity for detecting low-frequency DRMs without compromising sequence accuracy.;https://jcm.asm.org/content/56/6/e00105-18;8.0;8.2;8.6;00951137;;;

We aimed to retrospectively investigate the incidence and patterns of emergent RAMs of HIV-1 in HIV-positive adults experiencing virological failure to first-line nNRTI-containing combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in Taiwan. Patients and methods: Between June 2012 and March 2016, 1138 antiretroviral-naïve HIV-positive adults without baseline RAMs who initiated nNRTI-containing regimens were included for analysis. Virological failure was defined as plasma viral load (PVL) 200 copies/mL after 6 months of cART or confirmed PVL 200 copies/mL after achieving PVL <50 copies/mL. Population sequencing was retrospectively performed to detect baseline and emergent RAMs. RAMs were interpreted using the International AIDS Society-USA 2016 mutations list. Results: Seventy-one patients (6.2%) developed virological failure, which occurred in 14.8% (43/291), 3.9% (26/675), and 1.2% (2/172) of patients receiving 2 nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus nevirapine, efavirenz, and rilpivirine, respectively. Among those, 53 (74.6%) had emergent RAMs identified, which included 43 (81.1%), 53 (100.0%), and 1 (1.9%) with RAMs to NRTIs, nNRTIs, and protease inhibitors, respectively; and 43 (81.1%) had multi-drug resistance. The most common emergent RAMs to NRTIs were M184V/I (42.3%) and K65R (28.2%), and those to nNRTIs were Y181C (42.3%), K103N (15.5%), G190A/E/Q (12.7%), V179D/E (12.7%), and V108I (9.9%). Conclusion: While the rates of virological failure varied with the nNRTI used, the rate of emergent RAMs of HIV-1 to NRTIs and nNRTIs among the antiretroviral-naïve patients who failed nNRTI-containing cART remained low.";https://www.dovepress.com/patterns-of-emergent-resistance-associated-mutations-after-initiation--peer-reviewed-article-IDR;6.6;2.8;2.4;;;;

Despite the favorable profile of raltegravir (RAL), data on its combination with abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) are scarce. Based on clinical data, we evaluated this regimen as a switching strategy. Design Multicenter, non-controlled, retrospective study including all virologically suppressed HIV-1infected patients who had switched to RAL+ABC/3TC. Methods We evaluated effectiveness (defined as maintenance of HIV-1-RNA <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks) safety, tolerability, laboratory data, and CD4+ count at week 48 of this switching strategy. Results The study population comprised 467 patients. Median age was 49 years (IQR: 45–53). Males accounted for 75.4%. Median CD4+ count at baseline was 580 cells/L (IQR, 409). The main reasons for switching were toxicity/tolerability problems (197; 42.2%) and physician’s criteria (133; 28.5%). At week 48, HIV-1 RNA remained at <50 copies/mL in 371/380 (97.6%; 95%CI: 96.4–99.0) when non-virological failure was censured. Virological failure was recorded in 1.9% patients and treatment failure in 20.5% of patients (96/467 [95%CI, 16.9–24.2]). The main reasons for treatment failure included switch to fixed-dose combination regimens (31; 6.6%), toxicity/poor tolerability (27; 5.8%), and physician’s decision (17; 3.6%). A total of 73 adverse events were detected in 64 patients (13.7%). These resolved in 43 patients (67.2%). Of the 33 cases related or likely related to treatment, 30 were Grade-1 (90.9%). CD4+ count and renal, hepatic, and lipid profiles remained clinically stable over the 48 weeks. Conclusions Our findings suggest that RAL+ABC/3TC could be an effective, safe/tolerable, and low-toxicity option for virologically suppressed HIV-1-infected patients.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198768;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0198768;;

Methods: A qualitative assay was used to detect 20 antiretroviral drugs in five drug classes; this assay is based on liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution accurate-mass mass spectrometry. HIV viral load testing was performed using the RealTime HIV-1 Viral Load Assay. HIV drug resistance testing was performed using the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System. Logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with study outcomes. Results: Antiretroviral drugs were detected in 63 (34.4%) of 183 participants who had confirmed HIV infection at screening; 11 (17.5%) of the 63 participants were not virally suppressed. Six (54.5%) of the 11 participants had drug-resistant HIV, including four who had multiclass resistance. Seven (63.6%) of the 11 were at risk of acquiring resistance to additional antiretroviral drugs. In multivariate model, antiretroviral drugs were more frequently detected in older participants, those recruited from Kisumu, Kenya, and those who reported ever having been in HIV care or on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Conclusion: Most of HIV-infected persons screened for participation in HIV Prevention Trials Network 075 were not on ART, and many of those who were on ART were not virally suppressed. Many of those participants had drug-resistant HIV. These findings highlight the need for improved HIV care for African MSM and transgender women.";http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201806190-00010;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

In this scenario, the advent of single-tablet, once-daily, fixed-dose co-formulations is important for reducing pill burden and maximize long-term drug adherence. Cobicistat-boosted darunavir along with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide co-formulation (DRV/c/FTC/TAF or the trade name Symtuza®) is the first marketed protease inhibitor-based fixed-dose combination regimen for the treatment of HIV infection. It was approved in late 2017 by the European Medical Agency both for naïve patients and treatment-experienced patients with viral suppression. Areas covered: PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov and presentations at scientific meetings were searched with the terms ‘darunavir/cobicistat’ and ‘tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine’ for clinical trials either conducted to date or ongoing as well as a review of abstracts from major HIV/AIDS and infectious diseases conferences from 2015 to up to date. Expert opinion: DRV/c/FTC/TAF is a novel unique antiretroviral drug co-formulation that exhibits a convenient dosing, satisfactory safety profile, and high antiviral efficacy, even in patients harboring viruses with resistance to antivirals other than darunavir in the short-midterm. It represents the first fixed-dose combination therapy including a protease inhibitor given as one single pill once daily for drug-naïve patients and as second-line antiretroviral therapy.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14656566.2018.1472766;5.7;5.6;4.9;14656566;;;

Background: Hyperlipidaemia is a risk factor for the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is a frequent comorbidity in patients with HIV-1 infection, but the renal effects of statins remain unclear. Methods: We performed an observational, prospective study of HIV-infected patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy, with CKD and hyperlipidaemia, and starting a lipid-lowering treatment with rosuvastatin, atorvastatin or omega-3 fatty acids. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for >3 months. Results: As a whole, 69 patients (53 men, 58 Caucasian, median age 56.2 years) were enrolled. Overall, 25 patients started rosuvastatin (10 mg daily, group A), 23 patients atorvastatin (20 mg daily, group B), and 21 started omega-3 fatty acids (3 g daily, group C). At baseline, median eGFR was 54.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and the eGFR ranged between 50 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in 87% of patients. After 12 months, the median eGFR decline was significantly lower in group A (0.84 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and in group B (0.91 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) in comparison with the group C (1.53 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; p < 0.001 for both comparisons). The median decrease in prevalence of proteinuria and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was also significantly greater in groups A and B than in group C, while the incidence of treatment discontinuations was comparable across the three groups. Conclusion: In our study, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin showed a significant protective effect on the renal function compared to omega-3 fatty acids in HIV-1-infected patients with CKD and dyslipidaemia.";https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15284336.2018.1468676;2.8;2.7;0;15284336;;;

Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted among HIV-infected children < 18 years old (n = 705) who were on first-line cART. Liver enzymes, renal function, haematology, immunology and virological response were assessed at enrolment and followed bi-annually for 18 months. Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis were assessed using noninvasive markers including the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis score (FIB-4). Results: The median age was 12 [interquartile range (IQR) 8–14] years; 53.3% of patients were male. At enrolment, the median cART duration was 3.3 (IQR 1.1–6.1) years; 177 (25.1%) and 83 (11.8%) patients had elevated AST and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), respectively. A tenth of the children had an APRI score > 0.5, suggesting liver fibrosis. Being on a zidovudine (ZDV)- or nevirapine (NVP)-based regimen and having a viral load > 1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL were significantly associated with elevated ALT. Twenty-four (3.4%) and 84 (12.1%) patients had elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), respectively. As cART duration increased by 6 months, median BUN increased by 1.6 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4–2.7] mg/dL (P = 0.01); the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreased by 35.6 (95% CI 17.7–53.4) mL/min/1.73 m 2 (P < 0.0001); and AST and ALT decreased by 1.4 (95% CI 0.4–2.5) IU/L (P = 0.01) and 1.4 (95% CI 0.2–2.6) IU/L (P = 0.01), respectively. Conclusions: A high prevalence of liver enzyme and renal function abnormalities was observed at enrolment. Decreasing liver enzyme levels during follow-up are possibly reassuring, while the progressive reduction in GFR and the increase in BUN are worrisome and require further study.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/hiv.12693;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;

Since the advent of the first AIDS drug, AZT or zidovudine, a number of agents acting on different drug targets, such as HIV enzymes (e.g. reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase) and host cell factors critical for HIV infection (e.g. CD4 and CCR5), have been added to our armamentarium to combat HIV/AIDS. In this review article, we first discuss the history of the development of anti-HIV drugs, during which several problems such as drug-induced side effects and the emergence of drug-resistant viruses became apparent and had to be overcome. Nowadays, the success of Combination Antiretroviral Therapy (cART), combined with recently-developed powerful but nonetheless less toxic drugs has transformed HIV/AIDS from an inevitably fatal disease into a manageable chronic infection. However, even with such potent cART, it is impossible to eradicate HIV because none of the currently available HIV drugs are effective in eliminating occult ""dormant"" HIV cell reservoirs. A number of novel unique treatment approaches that should drastically improve the quality of life (QOL) of patients or might actually be able to eliminate HIV altogether have also been discussed later in the review.";http://www.eurekaselect.com/173455/article;5.0;5.7;6.6;15680266;;;

Objective: The primary objective is to report the 96-week virological suppression in our cohort, assessing the durability of this strategy in complicated situations. The secondary objective is to describe the safety and metabolic profile. Methods: All patients who had switched to DTG plus RPV between October 1, 2014, and September 30, 2015, were analyzed using a retrospective-prospective design, approved by ethics committees. Routine metabolic, immunological, and virological data were regularly sent to the coordinating center. Viral control was classified as HIV-1 RNA 50 copies/mL, 1 to 49 copies/mL, or undetectable (no virus detected [NVD]). Results: We followed 145 patients for a median of 101 weeks. The median age was 52 years; 31.7% were women, and 9.6% non-Caucasian; 50.3% had failed at least 1 antiretroviral regimen; and 15% had 50 copies/mL at baseline. The reasons for switching were as follows: simplification (51.7%), toxicity (36.5%), drug-drug interactions (6.9%), persistent low-level viremia (3.0%), nonadherence (2.1%), and viral failure (1.4%). By week 96, seven patients dropped out. At week 96, none had 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL, 138 (95.2%) had <50 copies/mL, and 123 (84.8%) had NVD. The low- to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C/HDL-C) ratio decreased significantly (P = 0.04). Of the 287 baseline altered laboratory parameters, 32.7% normalized by week 96.

Here, we report 48-week results of a phase 3 study investigating switching to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide from dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine in virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1 infection. Methods: In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial, HIV-1-infected adults were enrolled at 96 outpatient centres in nine countries. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older and on a regimen of 50 mg dolutegravir, 600 mg abacavir, and 300 mg lamivudine (fixed-dose combination or multi-tablet regimen); had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 50 mL/min or higher; and had been virologically suppressed (plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) for 3 months or more before screening. We randomly assigned participants (1:1), using a computer-generated randomisation sequence, to switch to co-formulated bictegravir (50 mg), emtricitabine (200 mg), and tenofovir alafenamide (25 mg; herein known as the bictegravir group), or to remain on dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine (herein known as the dolutegravir group), once daily for 48 weeks. The investigators, participants, study staff, and individuals assessing outcomes were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA of 50 copies per mL or higher at week 48 (according to the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm); the prespecified non-inferiority margin was 4%. The primary efficacy and safety analyses included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is ongoing but not actively recruiting participants and is in the open-label extension phase, wherein participants are given the option to receive bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide for an additional 96 weeks. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02603120. Findings: Between Nov 11, 2015, and July 6, 2016, 567 participants were randomly assigned and 563 were treated (282 received bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, and 281 received dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine). Switching to the bictegravir regimen was non-inferior to remaining on dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine for the primary outcome: three (1%) of 282 in the bictegravir group had HIV-1 RNA of 50 copies per mL or higher at week 48 versus one (<1%) of 281 participants in the dolutegravir group (difference 0·7%, 95·002% CI 1·0 to 2·8; p=0·62). Treatment-related adverse events were recorded in 23 (8%) participants in the bictegravir group and 44 (16%) in the dolutegravir group. Treatment was discontinued because of adverse events in six (2%) participants in the bictegravir group and in two (1%) participants in the dolutegravir group. Interpretation: The fixed-dose combination of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide might provide a safe and efficacious option for ongoing treatment of HIV-1 infection.

Multiple T-cell marker recovery (MTMR) has been proposed as the most complete level of immune reconstitution. We quantified differences in the CD4/CD8 ratio, CD4% recovery and MTMR after starting HIV-1 treatment with dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine vs. efavirenz (EFV)/tenofovir (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC). Methods: Exploratory post hoc analysis of the SINGLE study, a randomized double-blind, clinical trial. Percentage differences and corresponding precision based on 95% confidence intervals, and p values were calculated for CD4/CD8 ratio normalization, CD4% normalization and the achievement of MTMR. Cox models taking into account competing risks were used to estimate sub–hazard ratios when comparing the times to normalization of the CD4/CD8 ratio and the CD4% by treatment arm. Results: Data from 833 participants were analysed (414 in the dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine arm). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients who reached a CD4/CD8 ratio 0.5 at weeks 48 and 96. However, at week 96, the proportion of patients with a CD4/CD8 ratio 1 was higher in the EFV-TDF-FTC group (difference, 11.70; 95% confidence interval, 4.49–18.91; p 0.002). The decrease from baseline in CD8+ cell count was consistently greater in the EFV-TDF-FTC arm. Analysis of CD4+ percentages showed no significant differences during the study. The proportion of patients attaining a MTMR was higher in the EFV-TDF-FTC group, although the difference was only statistically significant at week 96 (p 0.001).

Registration of new antiretroviral drugs, modification of clinical praxis, updated general treatment guidelines and increasing knowledge about MTCT have necessitated regular revisions of the recommendations for ‘Prophylaxis and treatment of HIV-1 infection in pregnancy’. The Swedish Reference Group for Antiviral Therapy (RAV) has updated the recommendations from 2013 at an expert meeting 19 September 2017. In the new text, current treatment guidelines for non-pregnant are considered. The most important revisions are that: (1) Caesarean section and infant prophylaxis with three drugs are recommended when maternal HIV RNA >150 copies/mL (previously >50 copies/mL). The treatment target of undetectable HIV RNA remains unchanged <50 copies/mL; (2) Obstetric management and mode of delivery at premature rupture of the membranes and rupture of the membranes at full term follow the same procedures as in HIV negative women; (3) Vaginal delivery is recommended to a well-treated woman with HIV RNA <150 copies/mL regardless of gestational age, if no obstetric contraindications are present; (4) Treatment during pregnancy should begin as soon as possible and should continue after delivery; (5) Ongoing well-functioning HIV treatment at pregnancy start should usually be retained; (6) Recommended drugs and drug combinations have been updated.";https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23744235.2018.1428825;3.3;3.7;4.0;23744235;;;

We anticipated that in the case of protease inhibitors, a family of pH-dependent ARVs that display high aqueous solubility under the acid conditions of the stomach and extremely low solubility under the neutral ones of the small intestine, this strategy might fail owing to an uncontrolled dissolution-re-precipitation process that will take place along the gastrointestinal tract. To tackle this biopharmaceutical challenge, in this work, we designed, produced and fully characterized a novel Nanoparticle-in-Microparticle Delivery System (NiMDS) comprised of pure nanoparticles of the first-line protease inhibitor darunavir (DRV) and its boosting agent ritonavir (RIT) encapsulated within film-coated microparticles. For this, a clinically relevant combination of pure DRV and RIT nanoparticles was synthesized by a sequential nanoprecipitation/solvent diffusion and evaporation method employing sodium alginate as viscosity stabilizer. Then, pure nanoparticles were encapsulated within calcium alginate/chitosan microparticles that were film-coated with a series of poly(methacrylate) copolymers with differential solubility in the gastrointestinal tract. This coating ensured full stability under gastric-like pH and sustained drug release under intestinal one. Pharmacokinetic studies conducted in albino Sprague Dawley rats showed that DRV/RIT-loaded NiMDSs containing 17% w/w drug loading based on dry weight significantly increased the oral bioavailability of DRV by 2.3-fold with respect to both the unprocessed and the nanonized DRV/RIT combinations that showed statistically similar performance. Moreover, they highlighted the limited advantage of only drug nanonization to improve the oral pharmacokinetics of protease inhibitors and the potential of our novel delivery approach to improve the oral pharmacokinetics of nanonized poorly water-soluble drugs displaying pH-dependent solubility. Statement of significance: Protease inhibitors (PIs) are gold-standard drugs in many ARV cocktails. Darunavir (DRV) is the latest approved PI and it is included in the 20th WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. PIs poorly-water soluble at intestinal pH and more soluble under gastric conditions. Drug nanonization represents one of the most common nanotechnology strategies to increase dissolution rate of hydrophobic drugs and thus, their oral bioavailability. For instance, pure drug nanosuspensions became the most clinically relevant nanoformulation. However, according to the physicochemical properties of PIs, nanonization does not appear as a very beneficial strategy due to the fast dissolution rate anticipated under the acid conditions of the stomach and their uncontrolled recrystallization and precipitation in the small intestine that might result in the formation of particles of unpredictable size and structure (e.g., crystallinity and polymorphism) and consequently, unknown dissolution rate and bioavailability. In this work, we developed a sequential nanoprecipitation method for the production of pure nanoparticles of DRV and its boosting agent ritonavir in a clinically relevant 8:1 wt ratio using alginate as viscosity stabilizer and used this nanosuspension to produce a novel kind of nanoparticle-in-microparticle delivery system that was fully characterized and the pharmacokinetics assessed in rats.

In many studies, the algorithm version used is not specified. It is easy to assume that results across versions are comparable, but the effects of version changes on resistance calls are unknown. We evaluate these effects for 20 antiretroviral drugs. Methods: We calculated resistance interpretations for the same 5993 HIV-1 sequences, from participants in AIDS Clinical Trials Group studies, under 14 versions of the Stanford algorithm from 2002 to 2017. Trends over time were assessed using repeated-measures logistic regression. Changes in rule structure and scoring were examined. Results: For most drugs, the proportion of high-level resistance calls on the same sequences was greater using more recent algorithm versions; 16/20 drugs showed significant upward trends. Some drugs, especially tenofovir, had a substantial increase. Only darunavir had a decrease. Algorithm changes impacted calls for subtype C more than B. For intermediate and high-level resistance combined, effects were weaker and more varied. Over time, rules in the Stanford algorithm have become more complex and contain more subrules. The types of rule changes responsible for trends varied widely by drug. Discussion: Reporting the Stanford algorithm version used for resistance analysis is strongly recommended. Caution should be used when comparing results between studies, unless the same version of the algorithm was used. Comparisons using different Stanford versions may be valid for drugs with few changes over time, but for most comparisons, version matters, and for some drugs, the impact is large.";http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201809010-00016;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

The genetic component of this condition is not yet completely elucidated. Objective: To identify predictive genetic markers of immune response to ART. Methods: Case–control study. Out of 176 HIV-infected patients recruited in the city of Recife, Northeast Brazil, 67 patients with no immunologic response were the cases and the remaining 109 patients who responded were the controls. A set of 94 selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in antiretroviral drugs pharmacodynamic pathways and immune system homeostasis were genotyped, while the remaining 48 were ancestry informative markers (AIMs) for controlling for eventual hidden population structure. Results: Male patients were overrepresented in non-responder group (p = 0.01). Non-responders also started with lower absolute CD4+ T cell counts (p < 0.001). We found five SNPs significantly associated with the outcome, being three more frequent in non-responders than responders: rs2243250 (IL4) A allele (p = 0.04), rs1128503 (ABCB1) A allele (p = 0.03) and rs707265 (CYP2B6) A allele (p = 0.02), whereas the other two were less frequent in non-responders: rs2069762 (IL2) C allele (p = 0.004) and rs4646437 (CYP3A4) A allele (p = 0.04). Conclusion: Some significant univariate associations remained independently associated at multivariate survival analysis modeling, such as pre-treatment CD4+ T cells counts, IL2 and ABCB1 genotypes, and use of protease inhibitors, yielding a predictive model for the probability for immune response. More studies are needed to unravel the genetic basis of ART immunological non-response.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1413867018304665;2.5;3.0;3.2;14138670;;;

We aimed to describe drug resistance and investigate the factors associated with extensive resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), in patients failing second-line therapy in the HIV outpatient clinic at Arua Regional Referral Hospital, Uganda. Methods: We included patients who failed on second-line therapy (two consecutive viral loads 1000 copies/mm 3 by SAMBA-1 point-of-care test) and who had a drug resistance test performed between September 2014 and March 2017. Logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with NRTI genotypic sensitivity score (GSS) 1. Results: Seventy-eight patients were included: 42% female, median age 31 years and median time of 29 months on second-line therapy. Among 70 cases with drug resistance test results, predominant subtypes were A (47%) and D (40%); 18.5% had 1 major protease inhibitor mutation; 82.8% had 1 NRTI mutation and 38.5% had extensive NRTI resistance (NRTI GSS 1). A nadir CD4 count 100/ml was associated with NRTI GSS 1 (OR 4.2, 95% CI [1.3–15.1]). Thirty (42.8%) patients were switched to third-line therapy, composed of integrase inhibitor and protease inhibitor (60% darunavir/r) +/ NRTI. A follow-up viral load was available for 19 third-line patients at 12 months: 84.2% were undetectable. Conclusions: Our study highlights the need for access to drug resistance tests to avoid unnecessary switches to third-line therapy, but also for access to third-line drugs, in particular integrase inhibitors. Low nadir CD4 count might be an indicator of third-line drug requirement for patients failing second-line therapy.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/tmi.13131;5.3;4.7;4.5;13602276;;;

There is a constant need to improve antiretrovirals against HIV since therapy is limited by cost, side effects and the emergence of drug resistance. Kudzu is a climbing vine from which the root extract (Pueraria lobata), rich in isoflavones and saponins, has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine for a variety of purposes, from weight loss to alcoholism prevention. Here we show that Kudzu root extract significantly inhibits HIV-1 entry into cell lines, primary human CD4 + T lymphocytes and macrophages, without cell-associated toxicity. Specifically, Kudzu inhibits the initial attachment of the viral particle to the cell surface, a mechanism that depends on the envelope glycoprotein gp120 but is independent from the HIV-1 cell receptor CD4 and co-receptors CXCR4/CCR5. This activity seems selective to lentiviruses since Kudzu inhibits HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus, but does not interfere with Hepatitis C, Influenza, Zika Brazil and adenovirus infection. Importantly, depending on the dose, Kudzu can act synergistically or additively with the current antiretroviral cocktails against HIV-1 and can block viruses resistant to the fusion inhibitor Enfuvirtide. Together our results highlight Kudzu's root extract value as a supplement to current antiretroviral therapy against HIV.[Figure not available: see fulltext.];https://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12977-018-0446-x;7.3;6.7;6.7;;64;;

This study aimed to observe the therapeutic efficacy and safety of generic DAAs for affected Chinese patients. Design: Real-world setting to elucidate whether DAAs were tolerated and effective in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients. Methods: 176 HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients received anti-HCV DAA treatment together with ART regimens for HIV infection. Among the 176 patients, 99 patients were treated with SOF + DCV ± RBV, 60 patients were treated with SOF + LDV ± RBV, and 17 patients received SOF + RBV ± Peg-IFN regimens, for 12 or 24 weeks, respectively.

We aimed to identify the clinical, therapeutic, demographic, and laboratory features associated with spontaneous HCV clearance in 16 HIV-infected patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC, the largest case series, to our knowledge). Methods: This case series study reports the findings from 16 HIV/HCV coinfected patients with CHC who experienced spontaneous clearance of HCV infection. Patients were monitored between 2000 and 2013 in the Infectious Diseases Outpatient Clinic at the Centro Hospitalar S. João, Porto, Portugal. Results: Apart from antiretroviral therapy (ART), all patients were also consuming other potential hepatotoxic drugs (e.g., alcohol, illicit drugs, methadone, and antituberculosis medication). In all but 1 of the 16 HIV-infected patients with CHC, viral remission was associated with a temporary suspension of the ART. All patients showed a sustained HCV viral clearance. Conclusion: A possible drug-induced liver injury and/or suspension of ART may, in some cases, contribute to increasing the chances of spontaneous HCV clearance in HIV-infected patients with CHC.;https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/490056;2.6;1.9;1.9;03005526;;;

This study investigated the bioequivalence and pharmacokinetics of the fixed-dose combination tablet compared with those of separate tablets. Secondary endpoints were the tolerability and safety of the fixed-dose combination tablet. In this open-label, randomized-sequence, 2-way crossover trial, single doses of the fixed-dose combination tablet (the test treatment) and the combination of separate tablets (the reference treatment) were administered to healthy adults after a moderate-fat meal, with a 21-day washout between treatments. Pharmacokinetic samples were collected through 12 days after dosing. The primary endpoints were the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and the maximum concentration of drug in plasma (Cmax). The study employed a prespecified sample size reestimation based on a blind midpoint review of Cmax variability to update the enrollment size to achieve statistical power. Of 118 participants enrolled, 113 received both treatments and underwent pharmacokinetic assessment. The 90% confidence intervals for the geometric least-squares mean ratios for the AUC from 0 h to infinity, the AUC from 0 h to the last quantifiable measurement, and Cmax (test treatment versus reference treatment) were within the bioequivalence range of 0.80 to 1.25 for both drugs, indicating bioequivalence. In this study, a single dose of either treatment was well tolerated overall, with 4% (n 5) and 3% (n 3) of participants reporting adverse events considered related to the test and reference treatments, respectively. The dolutegravir-rilpivirine fixed-dose combination tablet is bioequivalent to a combination of separate tablets, and no new safety signals emerged.

Cross-sectional studies have suggested that HIV-infected women are more likely to be overweight than men, but observational studies evaluating sex differences in body mass index (BMI) increases following ART initiation are conflicting. Materials and Methods: We pooled data from three randomized clinical trials of ART initiation in persons with HIV in the United States. BMIs were compared between 760 women and 3041 men to test whether BMI changes in the first 96 weeks following initiation of ART differed by sex at birth. Linear regression estimated the relationship between sex and change in BMI from pre-ART initiation to week 96. Results: After 96 weeks, women gained an average of 1.91 kg/m2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64-2.19), men gained an average of 1.39 kg/m2 (95% CI 1.30-1.48); p for sex difference <0.001; the sex difference persisted within each pre-ART initiation BMI subgroup. After adjusting for pre-ART initiation age, CD4+ count, HIV-1 viral load, race/ethnicity, study, and ART regimen, mean BMI change for women was 0.59 kg/m2 (95% CI 0.37-0.81) more than for men (p < 0.001). Statistical interactions were observed between sex and both pre-ART CD4+ count and HIV-1 viral load and suggest that for subgroups with higher viral load and lower CD4+ at baseline, the estimated BMI changes in women are even larger than the average estimated difference. Conclusions: HIV-1-infected women experienced a significantly greater increase in BMI following ART initiation than men. These differences are a problem of clinical significance to women living with HIV.";https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/jwh.2017.6717;4.0;3.6;3.5;15409996;;;

We compared the prevalence of different resistance mutations in HIV-infected adults with virological failure in a cohort with regular routine viral load (VL) monitoring (Switzerland) and cohorts with limited access to VL testing (Uganda and Lesotho). Methods We considered individuals who had genotypic resistance testing (GRT) upon virological failure (1000 copies/mL) and were on ART consisting of at least one NNRTI and two NRTIs. From Lesotho, individuals with two subsequent VLs 1000 copies/mL despite enhanced adherence counselling (n = 58) were included in the analysis. From Uganda, individuals with a single VL 1000 copies/mL (n = 120) were included in the analysis. From the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS), a population without history of monotherapy or dual therapy with the first GRT upon virological failure (n = 61) was selected. Results We found that 50.8% of individuals in the SHCS, 72.5% in Uganda and 81.0% in Lesotho harboured HIV with high-level resistance to at least two drugs from their current regimen. Stanford resistance scores were higher in Uganda compared with Switzerland for all drugs used in first-line treatment except zidovudine and tenofovir (P < 0.01) and higher in Lesotho compared with Uganda for all drugs used in first-line treatment except zidovudine (P < 0.01). Conclusions Frequent VL monitoring and possibly pretreatment GRT as done in the SHCS pays off by low levels of resistance even when treatment failure occurs. The high-level resistance patterns in Lesotho compared with Uganda could reflect a selection of strains with multiple resistance during enhanced adherence counselling.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/74/2/468/5195617;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

There are substantial concerns about renal and bone toxicities of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF).Setting:HIV-1-infected treatment-naive adults in India, South Africa, and Uganda.Methods:A phase-4, 96-week, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial compared d4T 20 mg twice daily and TDF, taken in combination with lamivudine (3TC) and efavirenz (EFV). The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per milliliter at 48 weeks. Adverse events assessments included measures of bone density and body fat. The trial is registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02670772).Results:Between 2012 and 2014, 536 participants were recruited per arm. At week 96, trial completion rates were 75.7% with d4T/3TC/EFV (n = 406) and 82.1% with TDF/3TC/EFV (n = 440, P = 0.011). Noncompletion was largely due to virological failure [6.2% (33) with d4T/3TC/EFV versus 5.4% (29) with TDF/3TC/EFV; P = 0.60]. For the primary endpoint, d4T/3TC/EFV was noninferior to TDF/3TC/EFV (79.3%, 425/536 versus 80.8% 433/536; difference = -1.49%, 95% CI: -6.3 to 3.3; P < 0.001). Drug-related adverse event discontinuations were higher with d4T (6.7%, 36), than TDF (1.1%, 6; P < 0.001). Lipodystrophy was more common with d4T (5.6%, 30) than TDF (0.2%, 1; P < 0.001). Creatinine clearance increased in both arms, by 18.1 mL/min in the d4T arm and 14.2 mL/min with TDF (P = 0.03). Hip bone density measures, however, showed greater loss with TDF.Conclusions:Low-dose d4T combined with 3TC/EFV demonstrated noninferior virological efficacy compared with TDF/3TC/EFV, but mitochondrial toxicity remained high.

Introduction: Understanding the occurrence of antiretroviral (ARV)-related adverse events (AEs) among patients receiving second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) is important in preventing switches to more limited and expensive third-line regimens. Objective: This study aimed to estimate the rates and examine predictors of AEs among adult HIV-1-infected patients receiving second-line ART in the Right to Care (RTC) clinical cohort in South Africa. Methods: This was a cohort study of HIV-1-infected adult patients ( 18 years of age) initiating standard second-line ART in South Africa from 1 April 2004 to 10 January 2016. Our primary outcome was the development of an AE within 24 months of initiating second-line therapy. We used Kaplan–Meier survival analysis to determine AE incidence in the first 24 months of second-line ART. Predictors of AEs were modelled using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results: A total of 7708 patients initiated second-line ART, with 44.5% developing at least one AE over the first 24 months of second-line treatment. The highest AE incidence was observed among patients receiving abacavir (ABC) + lamivudine (3TC) + ritonavir-boosted lopinavir/atazanavir (LPVr/ATVr) (52.7/100 person-years (PYs), 95% confidence interval (CI): 42.9–64.8), while patients initiated on a tenofovir (TDF) + emtricitabine (FTC)/3TC + LPVr regimen had the lowest rate of AEs (26.4/100 PYs, 95% CI: 24.9–28.3). Clinical predictors of AEs included experiencing AEs when receiving first-line ART (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.3, 95% CI: 1.9–2.8), lower CD4 cell count (0–199 vs.  350 cells/mm 3 ; aHR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.4–1.8), and switching to second-line therapy from an ABC-base first-line regimen (ABC + 3TC + efavirenz/nevirapine [EFV/NVP] vs. TDF + 3TC/FTC + EFV/NVP; aHR 3.4, 95% CI: 1.1–11.1). Conclusions: The rates of AEs were lowest among patients receiving a TDF-based second-line regimen. Patients with poorer health at the time of switch were at higher risk of AEs when receiving second-line ART and may require closer monitoring to improve the durability of second-line therapy.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40264-018-0698-3;6.3;6.4;6.4;01145916;;;

This descriptive, longitudinal study assessed the dynamics of inflammation, humoral immune response, blood-brain barrier, blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier, as well as neuronal injury biomarkers in serially obtained CSF and serum samples from an antiretroviral (ARV) therapy-naïve patient with HIV-1 subtype C with CSF HIV genetic compartmentalization that resolved spontaneously without ARV treatment. The first CSF sample showed an increase in white blood cell (WBC) count (382 cells/mm3) and a marked increase in the levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-10, IP-10, and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), which raise the suspicion of dual infection. Serum sample analysis showed all cytokine levels to be normal, with only IP-10 slightly increased. These results corroborate the hypothesis that the CNS immunologic response in a patient with HIV infection was independent of the systemic immunologic response. The patient also had persistently elevated levels of sCD14, neopterin, and 2M, which were strongly suggestive of persistent CNS immunologic stimulation. This report describes a patient with HIV subtype C who developed a transient episode of asymptomatic HIV meningitis with compartmentalization of HIV in the CSF that resolved independently of ARV therapy. Extensive CSF studies were performed as part of an ongoing longitudinal study, which revealed CNS immune abnormalities. This case presents evidence of HIV-1 subtype C neurotropism and compartmentalization.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13365-018-0672-y;5.0;4.6;4.7;13550284;;;

As individual monitoring of DRMs and viral loads has limited availability, population data on DRMs are essential to determine first-line susceptibility. Paediatric data from sub-Saharan Africa are scarce and unavailable for Malawi. Objectives To determine the prevalence of virological failure (VF) and DRMs among ART-naive HIV-infected Malawian children during the first year of first-line ART. Methods In a prospective cohort of HIV-infected Malawian children, on first-line treatment, children were followed monthly; blood was collected for viral load testing (6 and 12 months) and genotypic resistance testing (12 months). VF was defined as at least one viral load >1000 copies/mL or death after 6 months of ART. DRMs were identified and susceptibility to NRTIs and NNRTIs was scored using the Stanford algorithm and by calculating genotypic susceptibility scores (GSSs). Results VF occurred in 66% (23/35) of the children during 12 months of follow-up. DRMs were detected in 44% (15/34); all had NNRTI resistance and 12% (4/34) had dual-class NNRTI/NRTI resistance. Reduced susceptibility (DRMs and GSS <3) was seen in 41% (14/34) to their current first-line regimen. High-level resistance was most common for nevirapine [26% (9/34)]. Conclusions In this first report on VF and DRMs in children on first-line ART in Malawi, the rates of VF and DRMs were alarmingly high. Paediatric HIV programmes in sub-Saharan Africa should emphasize programmatic evaluation of VF and include detection of DRMs to adjust and design adequate first- and second-line regimens and prevent widespread resistance in children.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/73/12/3471/5086493;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

HIV-1 drug-resistance (DR) genotypic testing thus plays an important role in the selection of optimal treatment regimens for HIV-infected individuals. Given the complexities of the testing procedures and the variety of approaches used, there is considerable potential for results to vary between laboratories. In Thailand, the national External Quality Assessment (EQA) scheme assesses the DR genotype testing performance of laboratories. Here, we evaluated the performance of laboratories in nucleotide sequencing and compared drug-resistance-associated mutations (DRMs) in the HIV-1 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes during 2010-2015. The EQA samples in the 12 panels showed predominance for the CRF01-AE (85%) and subtype B (15%). Fourteen laboratory datasets were generated: eight using TruGene (TG), two using ViroSeq (VS), and four using in-house (IH) assays. All IH and VS laboratories had penalty scores <7, whereas five of the eight TG laboratories had fluctuating penalty scores. Moreover, seven and six TG laboratories could not amplify the two identical samples, 10B and 10E samples, or the CRF01-AE. Our findings demonstrate the requirement for laboratory participation in the ongoing EQA program and the optimization of kit assays using CRF01-AE samples. Our results also indicate that one advantage of participation is that the laboratories can monitor and investigate the source of laboratory errors.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2017.0299;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

The fixed-dose STR combines the integrase strand transfer inhibitor dolutegravir with the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor rilpivirine. In two phase III non-inferiority trials (SWORD-1 and SWORD-2) in treatment-experienced patients already virologically suppressed on their current antiretroviral (ART) regimen, switching to once-daily dolutegravir plus rilpivirine maintained virological suppression over 48 weeks. Switching to a two-drug regimen of dolutegravir plus rilpivirine was also associated with high rates of virological suppression in real-world observational studies. Switching to once-daily dolutegravir plus rilpivirine was generally well tolerated and associated with more favourable renal and bone parameters than remaining on the current ART regimen. Longer-term, dolutegravir plus rilpivirine demonstrated durable maintenance of virological suppression and remained generally well tolerated for up to 100 weeks. Thus, dolutegravir/rilpivirine provides a convenient alternative treatment option for some adults with HIV-1 infection and no history of virological failure who are already virologically suppressed on (and wish to switch from) their current ART regimen.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40265-018-1005-4;9.4;9.2;9.6;00126667;;;

To achieve UNAIDS global targets, enhanced strategies are needed to improve quality of ART services and durability of available ART regimens, and to curb resistance. These strategies include roll out of drugs with greater efficacy and higher genetic barriers to resistance than those that are currently widely used, universal access to and improved effectiveness of viral load monitoring, patient-centred care delivery models, and reliable drug supply chains, in conjunction with frameworks for resistance monitoring and prevention. In this Review, we assess contemporary data on HIV drug resistance in LMICs and their implications for the HIV response, highlighting the potential impact and resistance risks of novel ART strategies and knowledge gaps.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352301818301735;14.3;17.7;19.0;;;;

This study aims to assess the efficacy and adverse effect events of LPV/r plus lamivudine and tenofovir or zidovudine as an initial antiretroviral treatment in HIV-1-infected individuals for whom cannot take efavirenz (EFV) or is allergic to EFV. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of patients registering with the China's National Free Antiretroviral Treatment Program from July 2012 to January 2017, followed at a tertiary care hospital in Beijing, China. The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA .40 copies/ml at 6 and 24 months of treatment. We assessed the immunological response and adverse events. Results: In total, 4,862 patients were enrolled in the study and 237 were eligible for analysis in each study arm. During the first six months, virological suppression was better with the LPV/r-based regimen than with the EFV-based regimen (93.80 vs 87.80% for P < 0.05). Viral suppression rates continued to increase until 12 months, remain steady thereafter until 24 months, for both groups. The multilevel analysis revealed that patients in the LPV/r group were more likely to display improvements in CD4 T-cell count over time than those in the EFV group (P < 0.001). Grade 3 or 4 laboratory adverse events were observed in 14 patients (5.91%) from the LPV/r group and three patients (1.20%) in EFV group. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that LPV/r-containing regimens are effective and well-tolerated in Chinese treatment-naive patients with HIV-1 infection.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fphar.2019.01472/full;4.7;3.9;5.0;;1472;;

This suggests that persistence and further transmission of HIV-1 that encodes transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRMs) is occurring in ART-naïve individuals. In this study, we analysed the prevalence and persistence of TDRMs in the protease and reverse transcriptase-sequences of ART-naïve patients within the German HIV-1 Seroconverter Study Cohort who were infected between 1996 and 2017. The prevalence of TDRMs and baseline susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs were assessed using the Stanford HIVdb list and algorithm. Mean survival times of TDRMs were calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The overall prevalence of TDR was 17.2% (95% CI 15.7–18.6, N = 466/2715). Transmitted NNRTI resistance was observed most frequently with 7.8% (95% CI 6.8–8.8), followed by NRTI resistance (5.0%, 95% CI 4.2–5.9) and PI resistance (2.8%, 95% CI 2.2–3.4). Total TDR (OR = 0.89, p = 0.034) and transmitted NRTI resistance (OR = 0.65, p = 0.000) decreased between 1996 and 2017 but has remained stable during the last decade. Viral susceptibility to NNRTIs (6.5%-6.9% for individual drugs) was mainly reduced, while <3% of the recommended NRTIs and PIs were affected. The longest mean survival times were calculated for the NNRTI mutations K103N (5.3 years, 95% CI 4.2–5.6) and E138A/G/K (8.0 years, 95% CI 5.8–10.2 / 7.9 years, 95% CI 5.4–10.3 / 6.7 years, 95% CI 6.7–6.7) and for the NRTI mutation M41L (6.4 years, 95% CI 6.0–6.7).The long persistence of single TDRMs indicates that onward transmission from ART-naïve individuals is the main cause for TDR in Germany. Transmitted NNRTI resistance was the most frequent TDR, showing simultaneously the highest impact on baseline ART susceptibility and on TDRMs with prolonged persistence. These results give cause for concern regarding the use of NNRTI in first-line regimens.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209605;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0209605;;

However, for the overall PDR prevalence in China, no report was found in published articles. In our study, an extensive cross-sectional investigation based on all newly diagnosed treatment-naive HIV-infected individuals was conducted. The overall prevalence of HIV-1 PDR among newly diagnosed treatment-naive HIV-1 individuals was 8.3% (60/720), obviously beyond the warning line (5.0%) set by WHO. The prevalence of PDR to PIs, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was 4.9% (35/720), 0.4% (3/720), and 2.5% (18/720), respectively. Moreover, the occurrence of HIV-1 PDR strains was random among different prefectures. HIV-1 PDR strains were extensively circulating among the sexual contact population inside and outside the Hebei province, especially between neighboring provinces and Hebei. Hebei province has become the moderate level PDR epidemic area. Enhanced surveillance for PDR is necessary among treatment-naïve individuals in Hebei, and we must take effective measures to cut off the spread of HIV PDR strains.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2018.0142;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

Our objective was to describe the evolution of drug resistance mutations among adults failing first-line ART in Zambia. Methods: We analysed data from a trial of VL monitoring in Lusaka, Zambia. From 2006 to 2011, 12 randomized sites provided either routine VL monitoring (intervention) or discretionary (control) after ART initiation. Samples were collected prospectively following the same schedule in each arm but analysed retrospectively in the control group. For those with virological failure (VF; >400 copies/ml), HIV genotyping was performed retrospectively on baseline (BL) and on all subsequent specimens until censored due to study completion, withdrawal or death. Results: Of 1,973 enrollees, 165 (8.4%) developed VF. 464 genotype results were available including 132 (80%) at BL, 116 (70%) at VF and 125 (76%) had at least one result between VF and censoring. Major nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations increased from 26% (BL) to 82% (VF) to 89% at last genotype (LG). M184 mutations increased from 2% to 59% to 71%; K65R from 2% to 11% to 13%; 2 or more thymidine analogue mutations from 1% to 3% to 12%. Among those on a failing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-based regimen, TDF resistance increased from 42% to 58%.

We observe no difference in provirus integration or replication-competent inducible latent HIV-1 in CD32+ or CD32- CD4+ T cells from HIV+ individuals.

Methods We followed two cohorts of HIV-1-infected Kenyan women: females in discordant couples (FDC) and female sex workers (FSW). We compared the distribution of undetectable (<150 copies/mL) and low PVL (<1,000 copies/mL) between the cohorts using bootstrap methods and exact Poisson regression. Results We evaluated 296 FDC and 220 FSW. At baseline, FDC were more likely to have undetectable (RR = 6.94, bootstrap 95% CI: 3.47, 20.81) and low PVL (RR = 3.53, bootstrap 95% CI: 2.57, 5.65) than FSW. Similarly, both repeat undetectable PVL (RR = 9.36, bootstrap 95% CI: 6.04, 10.97) and repeat low (RR = 4.99, bootstrap 95% CI: 2.33, 14.04) PVL were more likely among FDC than FSW during follow-up. Discussion We observed higher prevalence of viral control in FDC compared to FSW in the absence of ART, suggesting potentially higher prevalence of biological HIV resistance factors among discordant couples.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0208401;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0208401;;

We assessed different detection thresholds for pretreatment drug resistance to predict an increased risk of virological failure. Methods: We did a case-control study nested within a prospective multicountry cohort. Our study included patients from 12 clinical sites in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, and Zambia. We defined cases as patients with virological failure (ie, those who had either viral load 400 copies per mL at 12 months or had switched to second-line antiretroviral therapy [ART] as a result of virological failure before 12 months) and controls as those with viral suppression (viral load <400 copies per mL at 12 months) on first-line non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy. We assessed pretreatment drug resistance with Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencing, using the International Antiviral Society (IAS)-USA mutation list or the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (HIVDB) genotypic sensitivity score. We calculated diagnostic accuracy measures and assessed the odds of virological failure using conditional logistic regression for 1%, 5%, and 10% pretreatment drug resistance detection thresholds, compared with the conventional 20% or more used in Sanger-based sequencing. Findings: Paired viral load results before ART and at month 12 of follow-up were available from 1896 participants. We identified 178 patients with virological failure and selected 338 matched controls. We excluded 117 patients from pretreatment drug resistance analysis; therefore, 152 cases of virological failure and 247 controls were included in the final analysis. With the IAS-USA mutation list, at a detection threshold of 20% or more in patients with pretreatment drug resistance, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for virological failure was 9·2 (95% CI 4·2–20·1) compared with those without pretreatment drug resistance. Lowering the threshold resulted in adjusted ORs of virological failure of 6·8 (95% CI 3·3–13·9) at the 10% threshold, 7·6 (3·4–17·1) at the 5% threshold, and 4·5 (2·0–10·2) at the 1% threshold. Lowering the detection threshold from 20% improved the sensitivity (ie, ability to identify cases) from 12% (n=18) to 13% (n=19) at detection threshold 10%, to 15% (n=23) at detection threshold 5%, and to 17% (n=26) at detection threshold 1%, but caused a slight reduction in specificity (ie, ability to identify controls) from 98% (n=241) to 96% (n=238) at the 10% threshold, 96% (n=236) at the 5% threshold, and a larger reduction to 92% (n=227) at the 1% threshold. Diagnostic ORs were 5·4 (95% CI 2·1–13·9) at the 20% threshold, 3·8 (1·7–8·6) at the 10% threshold, 3·8 (1·8–8·1) at the 5% threshold, and 2·3 (1·2–4·2) at the 1% threshold. Use of the Stanford HIVDB genotypic sensitivity scores yielded similar ORs for virological failure, sensitivities, specificities, and diagnostic ORs. Interpretation: Ultrasensitive resistance testing for pretreatment drug resistance improved identification of people at risk of virological failure; however, this came with a reduction in our ability to identify people with viral suppression, especially at very low thresholds. Further modelling is needed to estimate the optimal trade-off for the 5% and 20% thresholds, balancing improved case finding against unnecessary regimen switching.

In AIDS Clinical Trials Group study A5224s, adipose mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels decreased on ART, and electron transport chain complex I (CI) and complex IV (CIV) activity decreased. Another study found decreased serum adiponectin on ART with mtDNA mutation m.10398A>G. We hypothesized that decreased adipose tissue mitochondrial function would be associated with lower adiponectin and insulin sensitivity on ART, and m.10398G would influence these changes.Design:Retrospective analysis of an ART-naive substudy population from A5224s.Methods:Analyses included adipose mtDNA levels, CI and CIV activity by immunoassay, visceral adipose tissue by computed tomography, and fasting serum glucose at week 0 and week 96 of ART. Fasting insulin and adiponectin were measured from cryopreserved serum using multiplex bead array. Homeostasis model assessment-2 (HOMA2)-IR and HOMA2-%B estimated insulin resistance and -cell function, respectively. The m.10398A>G mtDNA variant was available from existing genetic data.Results:Thirty-seven participants had adipose biopsies at week 0 and week 96. Percent decreases in CIV activity and adiponectin were correlated (Spearman rho 0.41; P = 0.01); this association persisted after controlling for age, sex, body mass index, or visceral adipose tissue in single-covariate regression. HOMA2-IR correlated with decreased CIV (-0.44; P = 0.01) and CI (-0.34; P = 0.05) activity. Among 12 non-Hispanic white persons, m.10398G was associated with decreased adiponectin (P = 0.04).Conclusions:Decreased adipose mitochondrial activity correlated with changes in adiponectin and glucose homeostasis on ART.

All Rights Reserved.Doravirine is a novel nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection. A population pharmacokinetic (PK) model was developed for doravirine using pooled data from densely sampled phase 1 trials and from sparsely sampled phase 2b and phase 3 trials evaluating doravirine administered orally as a single entity or as part of a fixed-dose combination of doravirine-lamivudine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. A one-compartment model with linear clearance from the central compartment adequately described the clinical PK of doravirine. While weight, age, and healthy versus HIV-1 status were identified as statistically significant covariates affecting doravirine PK, the magnitude of their effects was not clinically meaningful. Other intrinsic factors (gender, body mass index, race, ethnicity, and renal function) did not have statistically significant or clinically meaningful effects on doravirine PK. Individual exposure estimates for individuals in the phase 2b and 3 trials obtained from the final model were used for subsequent exposure-response analyses for virologic response (proportion of individuals achieving 50 copies/ml) and virologic failure. The exposure-response relationships between these efficacy endpoints and doravirine PK were generally flat over the range of exposures achieved for the 100 mg once-daily regimen in the phase 3 trials, with a minimal decrease in efficacy in individuals in the lowest 10th percentile of steady-state doravirine concentration at 24 h values. These findings support 100 mg once daily as the selected dose of doravirine, with no dose adjustment warranted for the studied intrinsic factors.;https://aac.asm.org/content/63/4/e02502-18;7.8;7.9;8.3;00664804;e02502-18;;

Rates of virological failure (200 copies/ml) and (complete) treatment interruption were estimated according to years since initial suppression. We used Poisson regression to examine associations of baseline characteristics with rates of virological failure or treatment interruption.Results:Among 19527 eligible PLWHIV with median (interquartile range) follow-up 3.7 (2.0-5.6) years after initial viral suppression, the estimated rate of the combined incidence of virological failure or treatment interruption fell from 9.0/100 person-years in the first year to less than 4/100 person-years beyond 3 years from suppression; considering only those remaining on EFV+TDF+FTC/3TC, the combined rate dropped from 8.2/100 person-years in the first year to less than 3.5/100 person-years beyond 3 years. PLWHIV with injecting drug-related or heterosexual transmission were at higher risk of virological failure or treatment interruption, as were those of Black ethnicity. PLWHIV aged less than 35 years were at higher risk of virological failure and treatment interruption.Conclusion:PLWHIV starting first-line EFV+TDF+FTC/3TC had low rates of virological failure and treatment interruption up to 10 years from initial suppression.

This would restrict the scope of switching to the World Health Organisation (WHO)-recommended standard second-line combinations (SLC) without HIV drug resistance (HIVDR)-testing in routine clinical practice. Methods: An observational study was conducted among 101 Cameroonian patients (55.4% male, median [IQR] age 34 [10-41] years) failing first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2016, and stratified into three groups according to NRTIs exposure: exposure to both thymidine analogues AZT ""and"" D4T (group-A, n = 55); exposure to both TDF and AZT ""or"" D4T (group-B, n = 22); exposure solely to D4T (group-C, n = 24). Protease-reverse transcriptase HIVDR was interpreted using the HIVdb penalty scores (60: high-resistance; 20-59: intermediate-resistance; < 20: susceptible). The acceptable threshold for potential-efficacy was set at 80%. Results: The median [IQR] CD4, viral RNA, and time on ART, were respectively 129 [29-466] cells/l, 71,630 [19,041-368,000] copies/ml, and 4 [2-5] years. Overall HIVDR-level was 89.11% (90/101), with 83.2% harbouring M184 V (high-level 3TC/FTC-resistance) and only 1.98% (2/101) major HIVDR-mutations to ritonavir-boosted protease-inhibitors (PI/r). Thymidine-analogue mutations (TAMs)-1 [T215FY (46.53%), M41 L (22.77%), L210 W (8.91%)], with cross-resistance to AZT and TDF, were higher compared to TAMs-2 [D67N (21.78%), K70R (19.80%), K219QE (18.81%)]. As expected, K65R was related with TDF-exposure: 0% (0/55) in group-A, 22.72% (5/22) group-B, 4.17% (1/24) group-C (p = 0.0013). The potential-efficacy of AZT vs. TDF was respectively 43.64% (24/55) vs. 70.91% (39/55) in group-A (p = 0.0038); 63.64% (14/22) vs. 68.28% (15/22) in group-B (p = 1.0000); and 37.50% (9/24) vs. 83.33% (20/24) in group-C (p = 0.0032). CRF02-AG was the prevailing subtype (63.40%), followed by CRF11.cpx (8.91%), A1 (7.92%), G (5.94%); without any significant effect of the subtype-distribution on HIVDR (92.2% in CRF02-AG vs. 83.8% in non-AG; p = 0.204). Conclusion: First-line ART-failure exhibits high-level NRTI-resistance, with potential lower-efficacy of AZT compared to TDF. Significantly, using our 80% efficacy-threshold, only patients without NRTI-substitution on first-line could effectively switch to SLC following the WHO-approach. Patients with multiple NRTI-substitutions (exposed to both thymidine-analogues and TDF) on first-line ART would require HIVDR-testing to select active NRTIs for SLC.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-019-3871-0;4.5;4.3;4.1;;246;;

Methods: Plasma samples from 112 patients with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) were collected for virus RNA extract and gene amplification. The mutations related to drug resistance were detected and the incidence was statistically analyzed, and the drug resistance rate against common drugs was also evaluated. Results: 103 cases were successfully amplified, and the main drug resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) region were M184V (50.49%), K103N (28.16%), Y181C (25.24%), and K65R (27.18%), while no drug main resistance mutation was found in the protease (PR) region. The incidence of drug resistance mutations was significantly different among patients with different ages, routes of infection, duration of treatment, initial ART regimens and viral load. The drug resistance rate to the common drugs was assessed, including Efavirenz (EFV, 71.84%), Nevirapine (NVP, 74.76%), Lamivudine (3TC, 66.02%), Zidovudine (AZT, 4.85%), Stavudine (D4T, 16.51%), and Tenofovir (TDF, 21.36%). Conclusion: The drug resistance mutations to NRTIs and NNRTIs are complex and highly prevalent, which was the leading cause of first-line ART failure. This study provides significant theoretical support for developing the second-line and third-line therapeutic schemes.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1347861319300027;4.8;4.6;4.0;13478613;;;

We collected peripheral blood samples from 63 individuals on antiretroviral therapy. The amplification of viral genomic fragments, viral subtyping, detection of HIV drug resistance-associated mutations (DRAMs), and phylogenetic analyses were performed. Viral subtyping revealed that the most prevalent HIV type 1 (HIV-1) subtype/circulating recombinant form (CRF) was CRF01-AE (84.1%), followed by subtype B (6.8%) and recombinants between CRF01-AE and CRF02-AG (4.5%). Although no major DRAMs were present in protease genes, they were detected in reverse transcriptase (RT) genes. Nine of 38 samples (23.7%) had major DRAMs against nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs) and/or non-NRTIs. The results of phylogenetic analyses indicated that CRF01-AE in North Sulawesi is related to that in Bali. Therefore, Bali may play an important role in circulating CRF01-AE in North Sulawesi.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2018.0221;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

The alarming spread of HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM) has become a national concern in China. Estimating men's sexual HIV infectiousness from blood plasma viral load (BPVL) depends on the association between BPVL and seminal plasma viral load (SPVL). However, previous studies were controversial and few concentrated on MSM. Twenty antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive MSM and 54 MSM under ART were recruited between July and September 2015 in the city of Hangzhou, China. Blood and semen were collected in pairs at the same visit for each individual. BPVL and SPVL were measured by COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test ver2.0. The mean viral load in blood plasma was higher than that in semen (4.5 ± 0.9 log 10 vs. 3.4 ± 1.3 log 10 ) in 20 ART-untreated MSM, and a positive correlation was found between BPVL and SPVL, as evaluated by linear regression (R 2 = 0.565, p < .001). A total of 96.3% (52/54) of ART-treated patients had successful viral suppression (<400 copies/mL) according to the BPVL. Fourteen subjects (25.9%, 14/54) presenting undetectable SPVL showed detectable BPVL, ranging from 20.4 to 7,470 copies/mL. Three subjects (5.6%, 3/54) presented detectable SPVL although BPVL was undetectable. MSM could pose a transmission risk despite undetectable BPVL. Consistent use of condoms and other risk-reduction strategies should be strongly advocated in MSM throughout all stages of HIV infection, regardless of ART.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2018.0090;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

We report an analysis of the contribution of participant characteristics to the disposition of tenofovir plasma concentrations. Tenofovir concentration data from a total of 817 individuals (88% of the total number of eligible patients randomly assigned to receive treatment in the TDF-containing arms of A5202) were available for analysis. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. One- and two-compartment models with first-order absorption and first-order elimination were evaluated. An exponential error model was used for examination of interindividual variability (IIV), and a proportional and mixed-error model was assessed for residual variability. The final structural model contained two compartments with first-order absorption and elimination. IIV was estimated for apparent clearance (CL/F) and the first-order absorption rate constant (ka), and a proportional residual variability model was selected. The final mean parameter estimates were as follows: ka = 2.87 h-1, CL/F=37.2 liters/h, apparent volumes of the central and peripheral compartments = 127 and 646 liters, respectively, and apparent intercompartmental clearance = 107 liters/ h. In addition to race/ethnicity, creatinine clearance and assignment to atazanavir/ ritonavir or efavirenz were significantly associated with CL/F (P < 0.001). In conclusion, race/ethnicity is associated with tenofovir oral CL in HIV-1 positive, treatment-naive adults. This covariate relationship raises questions about the possibility of differences in efficacy and risk of adverse events in different patient populations and suggests that examining preexposure prophylaxis regimens and tenofovir exposure in different race/ethnicity groups be considered.;https://aac.asm.org/content/63/4/e01638-18;7.8;7.9;8.3;00664804;e01638-18;;

Stimulating the T-cell receptor (TCR), which facilitates transition of resting into effector T cells, is the most effective strategy to purge these latently infected cells. Here we supply evidence that TCR-stimulated effector T cells still frequently harbor latent HIV-1. Methods: Primary HIV-1 infected cells were used in a latency assay with or without dendritic cells (DCs)and reversion of HIV-1 latency was determined, in the presence or absence of specific pathway inhibitors. Findings: Renewed TCR-stimulation or subsequent activation with latency reversing agents (LRAs)did not overcome latency. However, interaction of infected effector cells with DCs triggered further activation of latent HIV-1. When compared to TCR-stimulation only, CD4 + T cells from aviremic patients receiving TCR + DC-stimulation reversed latency more frequently. Such a “one-two punch” strategy seems ideal for purging the reservoir. We determined that DC contact activates the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway in CD4 + T cells. Interpretation: This insight could facilitate the development of a novel class of potent LRAs that purge latent HIV beyond levels reached by T-cell activation.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352396419300866;6.0;8.4;8.7;;;;

Similarly, HIV-1-positive individuals are now diagnosed and treated earlier with anticipated lifelong therapy. The contribution of specific antiretroviral agents to long-term morbidity and mortality is dependent on the pharmacologic characteristics of these agents, and it is increasingly important in this context.;https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/lookup/doi/10.2215/CJN.02240218;9.8;10.7;10.5;15559041;;;

Here, we show, using penile tissues from HIV-1-infected individuals under suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy, that urethral macrophages contain integrated HIV-1 DNA, RNA, proteins and intact virions in virus-containing compartment-like structures, whereas viral components remain undetectable in urethral T cells. Moreover, urethral cells specifically release replication-competent infectious HIV-1 following reactivation with the macrophage activator lipopolysaccharide, while the T-cell activator phytohaemagglutinin is ineffective. HIV-1 urethral reservoirs localize preferentially in a subset of polarized macrophages that highly expresses the interleukin-1 receptor, CD206 and interleukin-4 receptor, but not CD163. To our knowledge, these results are the first evidence that human urethral tissue macrophages constitute a principal HIV-1 reservoir. Such findings are determinant for therapeutic strategies aimed at HIV-1 eradication.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0335-z;9.3;16.5;23.2;;;;

All rights reserved.Background:HIV drug resistance and suboptimal adherence are the main reasons for treatment failure among HIV-infected individuals. As genotypic resistance testing is not routinely available in resource-limited settings such as Uganda, data on transmitted and acquired resistance are sparse.Methods:This observational follow-up study assessed the virological outcomes of patients diagnosed with virological failure or transmitted HIV drug resistance in 2015 at the adults' outpatient clinic of the Infectious Diseases Institute in Kampala, Uganda. Initially, 2430 patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) underwent virological monitoring, of which 190 had virological failure and were subsequently eligible for this follow-up study. Nine patients diagnosed with transmitted drug resistance were eligible. In patients with a viral load > 1000 copies/mL, genotypic resistance testing was performed.Results:Of 190 eligible patients, 30 (15.8%) had either died or were lost to follow-up. A total of 148 (77.9%) were included, of which 98 had had a change of ART regimen, and 50 had received adherence counseling only. The majority was now on second-line ART (N = 130, 87.8%). The median age was 39 years (interquartile range: 32-46), and 109 (73.6%) were women. Virological failure was diagnosed in 29 (19.6%) patients, of which 24 (82.8%) were on second-line ART. Relevant drug resistance was found in 25 (86.2%) cases, of which 12 (41.3%) carried dual and 7 (24.1%) triple drug resistance.Conclusion:Two years after initial virological failure, most patients followed up by this study had a successful virological outcome. However, a significant proportion either continued to fail or died or was lost to follow-up.;http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201904010-00015;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

All rights reserved.Background: The main objective of this study was to determine the frequency and patterns of HIV drug resistance-associated mutations among children under 18 months of age born to HIV-1-positive mothers enrolled in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission services in Haiti. Methods: Between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2014, HIV-positive remnant dried blood spots collected from children under 18 months of age for Early Infant Diagnosis at the National Public Health Laboratory were used for HIV-1 genotyping. HIV drug resistance mutations were analyzed using the Stanford Drug Resistance HIVdb program. Results: Of the 3555 dried blood spots collected for Early Infant Diagnosis, 360 (10.1%) were HIV-positive and 355 were available for genotyping. Of these, 304 (85.6%) were successfully genotyped and 217 (71.4%) had 1 drug resistance mutation. Mutations conferring resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTIs) and non-NRTIs were present in 40.5% (123) and 69.1% (210), respectively. The most frequent mutations were K103N/S (48.0%), M184V (37.5%), G190A/S (15.1%), and Y181C/G/V (14.1%). Predicted drug resistance analysis revealed that 68.8% of the children had high-level resistance to non-NRTIs and 11.5% had intermediate to high-level resistance to abacavir. Conclusions: This study showed high rates of resistance to NRTIs and non-NRTIs among newly HIV-diagnosed children in Haiti, suggesting that in the era of ""Option B+"" (initiation of lifelong combination antiretroviral therapy to pregnant women with HIV), the majority of children who acquire HIV infection through mother-to-child transmission of HIV have resistant HIV. These results have led the National HIV Program to revise the pediatric guidelines to include protease inhibitors in first-line regimens for all HIV-positive newborns.";http://journals.lww.com/00006454-201905000-00015;4.7;4.4;3.9;08913668;;;

Methods: Chemical interactions, surface morphology and mechanical strength of the FDC were ascertained. In vitro drug release studies were conducted in biorelevant media followed by in vivo study in the large white pigs, in comparison with a market formulation, Atripla®. In vitro-in vivo correlation of results was undertaken. Results: EFV, TDF and FTC were successfully entrapped in the 24-layered rectangular prism-shaped 3DP FDC with a loading of 12.5 mg/6.3 mg/4 mg of EFV/TDF/FTC respectively per printed layer. Hydrogen bonding between the EFV/TDF/FTC and HA-PQ10 was detected which was indicative of possible drug solubility enhancement. The overall surface of the tablet exhibited a fibrilla structure and the 90° inner pattern was determined to be optimal for 3DP of the FDC. In vitro and in vivo drug release profiles from the 3DP FDC demonstrated that intestinal-targeted and controlled drug release was achieved. Conclusion: A 3DP FDC was successfully manufactured with the aid of a 3D-Bioplotter in a single step process. The versatile HA-PQ10 entrapped all drugs and achieved an enhanced relative bioavailability of EFV, TDF, and FTC compared to the market formulation for potentially enhanced HIV treatment.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0939641118300493;7.9;8.4;8.0;09396411;;;

All rights reserved.The Roche Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan HIV-1 test, v2.0 (the CAP/ CTM assay), was used to quantify cell-associated HIV-1 (CAH) nucleic acid in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from well-characterized clinical specimens from HIV-1-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Chronically infected individuals on ART with no detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA demonstrated average CAH burdens of 3.2 HIV-1 log10 copies/million cells. Assay sensitivity and specificity were 98.9% and 100%, respectively, with the positive and negative predictive values being 100% and 98.6%, respectively. The CAH burden was also measured at weeks 0, 1, 2, 8, and 60 in 37 participants (RV254/SEARCH010, Bangkok, Thailand) stratified by Fiebig stage (Fiebig stage I [FI] to FVI) at ART initiation. Prior to ART initiation, the average CAH burden was 1.4, 4.1, and 3.6 log10 copies/million PBMCs for individuals who initiated ART at FI, FII, and FIII to FVI, respectively. Initiation of ART resulted in a rapid decline of CAH in all individuals, with the greatest decrease being observed in individuals who initiated ART at FI to FIII. By week 60, 100% (FI), 71.8% (FII/FIII), and 20.5% (FIV to FVI) of samples from individuals initiating treatment were at or near the limit of quantitation. Residual CAH was detectable at 60 weeks in most individuals who initiated ART at later stages (FIV to FVI) and averaged 1.9 0.7 log10 copies/ million PBMCs. The modified Roche CAP/CTM assay provides a convenient, standardized approach to measure residual HIV in blood and may be useful for monitoring patients under therapy or those participating in HIV remission studies.;https://jcm.asm.org/content/57/5/e01922-18;8.0;8.2;8.6;00951137;e01922-18;;

AIDS Clinical Trial Group 5199 compared neurological and neuropsychological test performance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected participants in resource-limited settings treated with 3 World Health Organization-recommended antiretroviral (ART) regimens. We investigated the impact of tuberculosis (TB) on neurological and neuropsychological outcomes. Methods. Standardized neurological and neuropsychological examinations were administered every 24 weeks. Generalized estimating equation models assessed the association between TB and neurological/neuropsychological performance. Results. Characteristics of the 860 participants at baseline were as follows: 53% female, 49% African; median age, 34 years; CD4 count, 173 cells/L; and plasma HIV-1 RNA, 5.0 log copies/mL. At baseline, there were 36 cases of pulmonary, 9 cases of extrapulmonary, and 1 case of central nervous system (CNS) TB. Over the 192 weeks of follow-up, there were 55 observations of pulmonary TB in 52 persons, 26 observations of extrapulmonary TB in 25 persons, and 3 observations of CNS TB in 2 persons. Prevalence of TB decreased with ART initiation and follow-up. Those with TB coinfection had significantly poorer performance on grooved pegboard (P < .001) and fingertapping nondominant hand (P < .01). TB was associated with diffuse CNS disease (P < .05). Furthermore, those with TB had 9.27 times (P < .001) higher odds of reporting decreased quality of life, and had 8.02 times (P = .0005) higher odds of loss of productivity. Conclusions.

HIV-infected adults without PAH on stable antiretroviral regimens (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil, emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir disoproxil, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil, abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine, or a ritonavir-boosted triple regimen) for  6 weeks received a single riociguat dose (0.5 mg). Riociguat pharmacokinetics and safety were assessed; pharmacokinetics was compared with historical healthy volunteer data. Of 41 participants treated (n = 8 in each arm, except n = 9 in the ritonavir-boosted triple regimen arm), 40 were included in the pharmacokinetic analyses. Riociguat median tmax was 1.00–1.27 h, with comparable maximum concentration (Cmax) across the five background antiretroviral groups.

HIV-exposed infants are at an increased risk of mortality, morbidity and slower early growth than their non-HIV exposed counterparts. Maternal HIV increases the risk of having preterm deliveries, intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight babies. However, the mechanism underlying dysregulation of fetal growth in HIV-infected pregnant women is unknown. We sought to determine whether maternal HIV is associated with dysregulation of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis, some angiogenic factors or other related biomarkers that regulate fetal growth. A total of 102 normotensive pregnant women were enrolled in a small cross-sectional study. Amongst these were thirty-one HIV-1 positive women receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) (Mean age: 30.0 ± 5.1 years; % on ART: 83.9%; median plasma viral load: 683 copies/ml; median CD4 count: 350 cells/ul) and 71 HIV uninfected women (mean age: 27.3 ± 5.8) recruited at delivery. A panel of biomarkers including IGF1 and IGF binding proteins (IGFBP1, IGFBP3), angiopoietins (ANG) 1 and 2, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 2 and 9, and galectin 13, was measured in plasma collected from the placental intervillous space. The levels of IGF1, IGFBP1, ANG1, ANG2, MMP2, MMP9 and Gal-13 were not affected by maternal HIV, even when adjusted for maternal factors in linear regression models (all p>0.05). It was observed that HIV-infection in pregnancy did not significantly affect key markers of the IGF axis and angiogenic factors. If anything, it did not affect women. These findings highlight the importance of the use of ART during pregnancy, which maintains factors necessary for fetal development closer to those of healthy women. However, decrease in IGF1 levels might be exacerbated in women con-infected with HIV and malaria.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215825;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0215825;;

Maraviroc (MVC) is the first in class co-receptor antagonist, which blocks HIV entry into host cells. MVC has an oral bioavailability of approximately 33%, which is limited by poor permeability as well as affinity for CYP3A and several drug transporters. While once-daily doses are now the favoured option for HIV therapy, dose-limiting postural hypotension has been of theoretical concern when administering doses high enough to achieve this for MVC (particularly during coadministration of enzyme inhibitors). To overcome low bioavailability and modify the pharmacokinetic profile, a series of 70 wt% MVC solid drug nanoparticle (SDN) formulations (containing 30 wt% of various polymer/surfactant excipients) were generated using emulsion templated freeze-drying. The lead formulation contained PVA and AOT excipients ( MVC SDN PVA/AOT ), and was demonstrated to be fully water-dispersible to release drug nanoparticles with z-average diameter of 728 nm and polydispersity index of 0.3. In vitro and in vivo studies of MVC SDN PVA/AOT showed increased apparent permeability of MVC, compared to a conventional MVC preparation, with in vivo studies in rats showing a 2.5-fold increase in AUC (145.33 vs. 58.71 ng h ml 1 ).

This study assessed the efficacy and safety of switching from a first-line NNRTI or boosted PI-based regimens to RPV-based regimens among virologically suppressed participants in resource-limited setting (RLS). Methods: This is a prospective cohort study. Participants with plasma HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL receiving cART were switched from a PI- or NNRTI-based, to a RPV-based regimen between January 2011 and April 2018. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA level < 50 copies/mL after 12 months of RPV. The secondary endpoint was the virological response at 24 months and safety endpoint (change in lipid profiles and kidney function from baseline to 12 months). Results: A total of 320 participants were enrolled into the study. The rationale for switching to RPV was based on toxicity of the current regimen (57%) or desire to simplify cART (41%). Totally, 177 (55%) and 143 (45%) participants were on NNRTI and boosted PI, respectively, prior to switching to RPV. After 12 months, 298 (93%) participants maintained virological suppression. There were significant improvements in the lipid parameters: TC ( 21 (IQR  47 to 1) mg/dL; p < 0.001), LDL ( 14 (IQR  37 to 11) mg/dL; p < 0.001) and TG ( 22 (IQR  74 to 10) mg/dL; p < 0.001). Also, there was a small but statistically significant decrease in eGFR ( 4.3 (IQR  12 to 1.1) mL/min per 1.73m2; p < 0.001). Conclusions: In RLS where integrase inhibitors are not affordable, RPV-based regimens are a good alternative option for PLHIV who cannot tolerate first-line NNRTI or boosted PI regimen, without prior NNRTI/PI resistance.";https://aidsrestherapy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12981-019-0222-6;3.2;3.8;4.4;;7;;

Patients and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of HIV-positive adults aged18 years at Connaught Hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone in November 2017. Sequencing was performed in the reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase regions, and interpreted using the Stanford HIVDR database andWHO 2009mutation list. Results: Two hundred and fifteen HIV-infected patients were included (64 ART naive and 151 ART experienced). The majority (66%) were female, the median age was 36 years and the median ART exposure was 48months. The majority (83%) were infected with HIV-1 subtype CRF02-AG. In the ART-naive group, the pretreatment drug resistance (PDR) prevalence was 36.7% (14.2% to NRTIs and 22.4% to NNRTIs). The most prevalent PDR mutations were K103N (14.3%), M184V (8.2%) and Y181C (4.1%). In the ART-experienced group, 64.4% harboured resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) and the overall prevalence of RAMs to NRTIs and NNRTIs was 85.2% (52/61) and 96.7% (59/61), respectively. The most prevalent RAMs were K103N (40.7%), M184V (28.8%), D67N (15.3%) and T215I/F/Y (15.3%). Based on the genotypic susceptibility score estimates, 22.4% of ART-naive patients and 56% of ART-experienced patients were not susceptible to first-line ART used in Sierra Leone. Conclusions: A high prevalence of circulating NRTI- A nd NNRTI-resistant variants was observed in ART-naive and-experienced HIV-1-infected patients in Sierra Leone. This necessitates the implementation of HIVDR surveillance programmes to inform national ART guidelines for the treatment and monitoring of HIV-infected patients in Sierra Leone.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/74/7/2024/5464304;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

Methods: Plasma was collected at the Complexe Pédiatrique of Bangui, Central African Republic, fromINSTI-naive children (n""8) and adolescents (n""10) in virological failure (viral load.1000 copies/mL) after 5 years of first- A nd/or second-line combination ART (cART). IN, reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (P) genes were genotyped and drug resistancemutations (DRMs) to INSTIs, NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIswere interpreted using the Stanford algorithm. Results: Successful IN, RT and P genotypes were obtained for 18, 13 and 15 children (median age 11 years, range 5-18; 8 were female), respectively. Two (2/18; 11.1%) viruses from children treated with a first-line regimen had INSTI DRMs at codon 138 (E138K and E138T), which is known to harbour major resistance mutations, and also had the accessorymutations L74I, G140K, G140R and G163R. Themajority (16/18; 88.9%) of HIV-1 IN sequences demonstrated full susceptibility to allmajor INSTIs with a high frequency of natural polymorphicmutations. Most (12/15; 80%) genotyped viruses harboured at least one major DRM conferring resistance to at least one of the WHO-recommended antiretroviral drugs (NNRTIs, NRTIs and PIs) prescribed in first- A nd second-line regimens. Conclusions: INSTIs could be proposed in first-line regimens in the majority of African children or adolescents and may constitute relevant therapeutic alternatives as second- A nd third-line cART regimens in HIV-infected children and adolescents living in sub-Saharan Africa.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/74/7/2030/5396701;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.One of the major factors contributing to HIV-1 drug resistance is suboptimal adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Currently, recommended cART for HIV-1 treatment is a three-drug combination, whereas the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimens consist of one or two antivirals. Treatment regimens require adherence to a once or twice (in a subset of patients) daily dose. Long-acting formulations such as injections administered monthly could improve adherence and convenience, and thereby have potential to enhance the chances of expected outcomes, although long-lasting drug concentrations can also contribute to clinical issues like adverse events and development of drug resistance. Globally, two long-acting antivirals have been approved, and fifteen are in clinical trials. More than half of investigational long-acting antivirals target HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) and/or integrase (HIV-1 IN). Here, we discuss the status and potential of long-acting inhibitors, including rilpivirine (RPV), dapivirine (DPV), and 4-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2-deoxyadenosine (EFdA; also known as MK-8591), which target RT, and cabotegravir (CAB), which targets IN. The outcomes of various clinical trials appear quite satisfactory, and the future of long-acting HIV-1 regimens appears bright.";https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/12/2/62;6.1;5.0;5.4;;62;;

Karger AG, Basel.Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate drug resistance patterns among Iranian people living with HIV who have taken antiretroviral therapy for 9-15 months. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between December 2015 and May 2016. Two hundred fifty-two blood samples were collected from all eligible HIV-infected patients at fourteen healthcare settings, located in major provinces in Iran. The samples were examined for presence of drug resistance strains and viral load level. Moreover, a phylogenetic tree, using neighbor joining, was constructed and HIV subtypes were determined. Results: The most common subtypes were CRF35-AD (47.6%) and A1 (42.8%), followed by 45-CPX (4.8%) and C (4.8%). The resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and protease inhibitors was reported as 19.2, 19.2, and 10.3%, respectively. M184I/V mutation was the most frequent (31.6%) mutation among NRTI-based regimens. Moreover, K103E/N was the most frequent (34.2%) NNRTI mutation. Conclusions: This is the first study to illuminate the emergence of the CPX genotype among Iranian patients. The drug resistance rate of NNRTIs was similar to that of NRTIs. By assessing drug resistance, it is possible to evaluate the efficacy of treatment and patient adherence to treatment.;https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/497036;2.6;1.9;1.9;03005526;;;

Using cell-associated DNA and cell-free RNA of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), we investigated the role of drug-resistant viral variants that emerged during early antiretroviral therapy (ART) in determining virological outcome. This case-control study compared virologic nonresponder children (two viral loads [VLs]  200 copies/mL within 2 years of ART) and responder children (two VLs < 200 copies/mL after six months of ART) infected with HIV-1 initiated on nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART. The partial reverse-transcriptase gene of HIV-1 in cell-associated DNA was genotyped using next-generation sequencing (NGS; Illumina; threshold 0.5%; at baseline and month six of ART) and in cell-free RNA (concurrently and at virological failure; VL > 1000 copies/mL at  12 months of ART) using the Sanger method. Among 30 nonresponders and 37 responders, baseline differences were insignificant while adherence, VL, and drug resistance mutations (DRMs) observed at month six differed significantly (P  0.05). At month six, NGS estimated a higher number of DRMs compared with Sanger (50% vs 33%; P = 0.001). Among the nonresponders carrying a resistant virus (86.6%) at virological failure, 26% harbored clinically relevant low-frequency DRMs in the cell-associated DNA at month six (0.5%-20%; K103N, G190A, Y181C, and M184I). Plasma VL of > 3 log 10 copies/mL (AOR, 30.4; 95% CI, 3.3-281; P = 0.003) and treatment-relevant DRMs detected in the cell-associated DNA at month six (AOR, 24.2; 95% CI, 2.6-221; P = 0.005) were independently associated with increased risk for early virological failure. Our findings suggest that treatment-relevant DRMs acquired in cell-associated DNA during the first six months of ART can predict virological failure in children initiated on NNRTI-based ART.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25413;3.8;3.9;4.0;01466615;;;

We assessed the efficacy, safety and tolerability of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide compared with co-formulated dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine at week 96. Methods: This ongoing, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, active-controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority trial was done at 122 outpatient centres in nine countries. We enrolled adults (aged 18 years)living with HIV who were treatment naive and HLA-B*5701 negative, did not have hepatitis B virus infection, and had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 50 mL/min. We randomly assigned participants (1:1)to receive co-formulated bictegravir 50 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg (the bictegravir group)or co-formulated dolutegravir 50 mg, abacavir 600 mg, and lamivudine 300 mg (the dolutegravir group), each with matching placebo, once daily for 144 weeks. Treatment allocation was masked to all participants and investigators. All participants who received at least one dose of study drug were included in primary efficacy and safety analyses. We previously reported the primary endpoint. Here, we report the week 96 secondary outcome of proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL at week 96 by US Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm, with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 12%. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02607930. Findings: Between Nov 13, 2015, and July 14, 2016, we screened 739 participants, of whom 108 were excluded and 631 enrolled and randomly assigned to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (n=316)or dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine (n=315). Two participants in the bictegravir group did not receive at least one dose of their assigned drug and were excluded from analyses. At week 96, bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide was non-inferior to dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine, with 276 (88%)of 314 participants in the bictegravir group versus 283 (90%)of 315 participants in the dolutegravir group achieving HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL (difference 1·9%; 95% CI 6·9 to 3·1). The most common adverse events were nausea (36 [11%]of 314 for the bictegravir group vs 76 [24%]of 315 for the dolutegravir group), diarrhoea (48 [15%]vs 50 [16%]), and headache (41 [13%]vs 51 [16%]). 36 (11%)participants in the bictegravir group versus 39 (12%)participants in the dolutegravir group had a serious adverse event. Two individuals died in the bictegravir group (recreational drug overdose and suicide, neither of which was treatment related)and none died in the dolutegravir group. No participants discontinued because of adverse events in the bictegravir group compared with five (2%)of 315 in the dolutegravir group. Study drug-related adverse events were reported for 89 (28%)participants in the bictegravir group and 127 (40%)in the dolutegravir group. Interpretation: These week 96 data support bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide as a safe, well tolerated, and durable treatment for people living with HIV-1 with no emergent resistance.

In this study, we evaluated the HRQoL and factors associated with this outcome in 366 patients initiating combination Antiretroviral Therapy (cART) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.We measured HRQoL using the EuroQoL-5D 3 level (EQ-5D) and the HIV instrument of the World Health Organization (WHOQOL-HIV BREF) and identified factors associated with HRQoL using multilevel linear regression. Participants had been on cART treatment a median of 65.5 days at the time the instruments were completed. The median HRQoL of patients on the single-tablet regimen containing efavirenz/ tenofovir/ lamivudine and the multi-tablet regimen containing dolutegravir and tenofovir/ lamivudine were high, with no significant difference between groups. Factors consistently associated with lower HRQoL were being single (unmarried), having a lower educational level, recent cigarette smoking, recent signs and symptoms of anxiety or depression, comorbid disease and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions. We observed high levels of HRQoL in cART-treated people and no differences between dolutegravir and efavirenz-based regimens.

We described acquired drug resistance mutations in pol gene and performed a viral genome wide association study in virologic treatment failure patients who started first line ART during 2009-2011 in the first large countrywide HIV cohort in Ethiopia. Methods: The outcome of tenofovir (TDF)- and zidovudine (ZDV)-based ART was defined in 874 ART naïve patients using the on-treatment (OT) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. Genotypic resistance testing was done in patients failing ART (> 1000 copies/ml) at month 6 and 12. Near full-length genome sequencing (NFLG) was used to assess amino acid changes in HIV-1 gag, pol, vif, vpr, tat, vpu, and nef genes between paired baseline and month 6 samples. Results: High failure rates were found in ITT analysis at month 6 and 12 (23.3%; 33.9% respectively). Major nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NRTI/NNRTI) drug resistance mutations were detected in most failure patients at month 6 (36/47; 77%) and month 12 (20/30; 67%). A high rate of K65R was identified only in TDF treated patients (35.7%; 50.0%, respectively). No significant difference was found in failure rate or extent of HIVDR between TDF- and ZDV- treated patients. All target regions of interest for HIVDR were described by NFLG in 16 patients tested before initiation of ART and at month 6. Conclusion: In this first Ethiopian national cohort, a high degree of HIVDR was seen among ART failure patients, independent on whether TDF- or ZDV was given. However, the major reason to ART failure was lost-to-follow-up rather than virologic failure. Our NFLG assay covered all relevant target genes for antiretrovirals and is an attractive alternative for HIVDR surveillance.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-019-4196-8;4.5;4.3;4.1;;569;;

All rights reserved.Objective:The aim of this study was to explore the contribution of blood and colon myeloid cells to HIV persistence during antiretroviral therapy (ART).Design:Leukapheresis was collected from HIV-infected individuals with undetectable plasma viral load during ART (HIV+ART; n=15) and viremics untreated (HIV+; n=6). Rectal sigmoid biopsies were collected from n=8 HIV+ART.Methods:Myeloid cells (total monocytes (Mo), CD16+/CD16- Mo, CD1c+ dendritic cells) and CD4+ T cells were isolated by magnetic-Activated cell sorting (MACS) and/or fluorescence-Activated cell sorting (FACS) from peripheral blood. Matched myeloid and CCR6+CD4+ T cells were isolated from blood and rectal biopsies by FACS. Levels of early (RU5 primers), late (Gag primers) and/or integrated HIV-DNA (Alu/HIV primers) were quantified by nested real-Time PCR. Replication-competent HIV was amplified by co-culturing cells from HIV-positive individuals with CD3/CD28-Activated CD4+ T cells from uninfected donors.Results:Early/late but not integrated HIV reverse transcripts were detected in blood myeloid subsets of four out of 10 HIV+ART; in contrast, integrated HIV-DNA was exclusively detected in CD4+ T cells. In rectal biopsies, late HIV reverse transcripts were detected in myeloid cells and CCR6+CD4+ T cells from one out of eight and seven out of eight HIV+ART individuals, respectively. Replication-competent HIV was outgrown from CD4+ T cells but not from myeloid of untreated/ART-Treated HIV-positive individuals.Conclusion:In contrast to CD4+ T cells, blood and colon myeloid cells carry detectable HIV only in a small fraction of HIV+ART individuals. This is consistent with the documented resistance of Mo to HIV infection and the rapid turnover of Mo-derived macrophages in the colon. Future assessment of multiple lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues is required to include/exclude myeloid cells as relevant HIV reservoirs during ART.";http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201907010-00003;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

Considerable HIV drug resistance has occurred among persons failing tenofovir-containing first-line ART. We evaluated drug resistance at the population level using mathematical modeling. Setting Heterosexual HIV epidemic in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Methods We constructed a stochastic individual-based model and simulated scenarios of ART implementation, either CD4-based (threshold < 500 cells/mL) or Fast-track (81% coverage by 2020), with consideration of major drug-associated mutations (M184V, K65R and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)). Using base case and uncertainty analyses, we assessed (majority) drug resistance levels. Results By 2030, the median total resistance (proportion of HIV-infected persons with drug resistance) is predicted to reach 31.4% (interquartile range (IQR): 16.5%-50.2%) with CD4-based ART, decreasing to 14.5% (IQR: 7.7%-25.8%) with Fast-track implementation. In both scenarios, we find comparably high prevalence (~80%) of acquired NNRTI-associated, M184V and K65R mutations. Over 48% of individuals with acquired resistance harbor dual, 44% triple and 7% just single drug mutations. Drug-resistant HIV is predicted to comprise 40% (IQR: 27%-50%) of incident infections, while 70% of prevalent transmitted resistance is NNRTI-associated. At 2018, the projected total resistance is 15% (IQR: 7.5%-25%), with 18% (IQR: 13%-24%) of incident infections from transmitted drug-resistant HIV. Conclusions WHO-recommended preferred first-line ART could lead to substantial drug resistance. Effective surveillance of HIV drug resistance and utilization of second-line as well as alternative first-line regimens is crucial.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0218649;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0218649;;

In this contest, it is unclear whether having previously experienced virological failure (VF)of cART remains an important predictor of future risk of VF in people receiving cART in modern times. We investigated the rate of VF and factors potentially associated with this event in 9220 HIV-1 infected patients enrolled in the Icona Cohort who showed a stable viral suppression on modern cART regimens after January 1, 2006. Methods: We investigated two main exposure factors: current calendar period (2006–2009; 2010–2013; 2014–2017)and number of VFs (0; 1–3; >3)prior to baseline. Relative rates of VF were estimated from fitting a Poisson regression model. Results: Seven-hundred-seventy-nine patients experienced VF over follow-up for an overall rate of 2.08 per 100 person years of follow-up (PYFU, 95%CI: 1.93–2.22). The rate of VF increased with higher numbers of previous VFs: patients with >3 previous VFs had a rate of 4.87 (4.10–5.78), 2.75-fold higher than that observed in patients without any previous VF (p < 0.001). The rate of VF was lower in recent years: 3.81 (3.36, 4.32)in 2006–2009; 1.36 (1.20–1.53)in 2014–2017 (p < 0.001). Other factors independently associated with lower risk of VF were Italian origin, longer history of virological suppression, and university education level. Conclusions: In HIV-infected patients virologically suppressed after January 2006, the rate of VF continues to show a decline even in the most recent years. Previous VFs should be carefully considered.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1386653219300976;5.7;6.0;5.9;13866532;;;

This study was conducted to ascertain the sero-prevalence of HIV/HBV and HIV/HCV co-infections, evaluate the effect of the co-infections on the immunological and virological characteristics and assess the association between some demographic and lifestyle characteristics and risk of HBV, HCV, HIV/HBV and HIV/HCV co-infections among pregnant women living in the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana. Methods This comparative cross-sectional study was conducted at the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) clinics of the St. Elizabeth Hospital and the Holy Family Hospital, Brong-Ahafo Region, Ghana. A total of 248 consecutive consenting pregnant Ghanaian women, 148 diagnosed with HIV [HIV (+)] and 100 who were HIV negative [HIV (-)], were recruited. Validated questionnaire was used to obtain demographic and lifestyle data. Venous blood samples were obtained and HCV status, HBV profile, CD4+ T cell count, and HIV-1 RNA load were determined. Results The sero-prevalence of HIV (+) /HBV, HIV (+) /HCV, HIV (-)/HBV, and HIV (-)/HCV infections were 22 (14.9%), 6 (4.1%), 10 (10.0%), and 12 (12.0%) respectively. HIV-1 viral load was not significantly different between HIV/HBV, HIV/HCV co-infection and HIV mono-infection. However, CD4+ T lymphocyte count (364 vs 512 vs 514 cells/l; p = 0.0009) was significantly lower in HIV/HBV co-infection compared to HIV/HCV and HIV mono-infection respectively. There was no significant association between demographic and lifestyle characteristics and risk of HBV and HCV infections in HIV positive and negative subjects except for late diagnosis of HIV and history of sharing razors blades and pins, where increased odds of HIV (+) /HBV and HIV (-)/HBV infection were observed. Conclusions The prevalence of HIV (+)/HBV (14.9%), HIV (+)/HCV (4.1%), HIV (-)/HBV (10.0%), and HIV (-)/HCV (12.0%) are high among pregnant women in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana. HIV/HBV is associated with reduced CD4+ T lymphocyte count but not HIV-1 viral load. Early diagnosis of HIV and intensification of routine antenatal HBV and HCV are essential to abate the risk of maternal to child transmission.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219922;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0219922;;

This NMA compared the efficacy and safety of dolutegravir (DTG) with other recommended or commonly used core antiretroviral agents. Methods: A systematic review identified phase 3/4 RCTs in treatment-naïve patients with HIV-1 receiving core agents: ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (PIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), or integrase strand inhibitors (INSTIs). Efficacy (virologic suppression [VS], CD4+ cell count change from baseline) and safety (adverse events [AEs], discontinuations, discontinuation due to AEs, lipid changes) were analyzed at Week 48 using Bayesian NMA methodology, which allowed calculation of probabilistic results. Subgroup analyses were conducted for VS (baseline viral load [VL] /> 100,000copies/mL, /> 500,000copies/mL; baseline CD4+ />200cells/L). Results were adjusted for the nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) combined with the core agent (except subgroup analyses). Results: The NMA included 36 studies; 2 additional studies were included in subgroup analyses only. Odds of achieving VS with DTG were statistically superior to PIs (odds ratios [ORs] 1.78-2.59) and NNRTIs (ORs 1.51-1.86), and similar but numerically higher than other INSTIs. CD4+ count increase was significantly greater with DTG than PIs (difference: 23.63-31.47 cells/L) and efavirenz (difference: 34.54 cells/L), and similar to other core agents. INSTIs were more likely to result in patients achieving VS versus PIs (probability: 76-100%) and NNRTIs (probability: 50-100%), and a greater CD4+ count increase versus PIs (probability: 72-100%) and NNRTIs (probability: 60-100%). DTG was more likely to result in patients achieving VS (probability: 94-100%), and a greater CD4+ count increase (probability: 53-100%) versus other core agents, including INSTIs (probability: 94-97% and 53-93%, respectively). Safety outcomes with DTG were generally similar to other core agents. In patients with baseline VL > 100,000copies/mL or  200 CD4+cells/L (18 studies), odds of achieving VS with DTG were superior or similar to other core agents. Conclusion: INSTI core agents had superior efficacy and similar safety to PIs and NNRTIs at Week 48 in treatment-naïve patients with HIV-1, with DTG being among the most efficacious, including in patients with baseline VL > 100,000copies/mL or  200 CD4+cells/L, who can be difficult to treat.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-019-3975-6;4.5;4.3;4.1;;484;;

As fixed dose coformulations (FDCs) are often more expensive in comparison to the same drugs administered separately in a multi-tablet regimen (MTR), we considered a costeffective strategy involving patients in the switch from their FDCs to corresponding MTRs including generic antiretrovirals. AIM To verify if this would affect the virological and immunological response in comparison to maintaining the FDC regimens. METHODS From January 2012 to December 2013, we assessed the eligibility of all the HIV-1 positive adults on stable HAART being treated at our hospital-based outpatient clinic in Treviso, Italy. Participants who accepted to switch from their FDC regimen to the corresponding MTR joined the MTR group, while those who maintained a FDC regimen joined the FDC group. Clinical data, including changes in HAART regimens, respective reasons why and adverse effects, were recorded at baseline and at follow-up visits occurring at weeks 24, 48 and 96. All participants were assessed for virological and immunological responses at baseline and at weeks 24, 48 and 96. RESULTS Two hundred and forty-three eligible HIV-1 adults on HAART were enrolled: 163 (67%) accepted to switch to a MTR, joining the MTR group, while 80 (33%) maintained their FDCs, joining the FDC group. In a parallel analysis, there were no significant differences in linear trend of distribution of HIV-RNA levels between the two groups and there were no significant odds in favour of a higher level of HIV-RNA in either group at any follow-up and on the overall three strata analysis. In a before-after analysis, both FDC and MTR groups presented no significant differences in distribution of HIV-RNA levels at either weeks 48 vs 24 and weeks 96 vs 24 cross tabulations. A steady increase of mean CD4 count was observed in the MTR group only, while in the FDC group we observed a slight decrease (-23 cells per mmc) between weeks 24 and 48. CONCLUSION Involving patients in the switch from their FDC regimens to the corresponding MTRs for economic reasons did not affect the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy in terms of virological response and immunological recovery.;https://www.wjgnet.com/2307-8960/full/v7/i14/1814.htm;0;0.0;0.3;;;;

We tested We reviewed eleven new cases of HIV patients who had virologic failure after 6 months first-line antiretroviral therapy. With the sequencing method, analysis of gene mutations encoded HIV drug resistance. Genotypic resistance results and HIV-1 subtype were interpreted by Stanford DR database. Of ten plasma samples that were successfully amplified and sequenced, all samples were resistant to at least one antiretroviral drug. Genotypic resistance towards the antiretroviral drugs being used was observed in lamivudine (90%), tenofovir (83%), nevirapine (100%) dan efavirenz (100%). It is interesting that no zidovudine resistance were found, including in four patients receiving zidovudine in their HAART. The common NRTI mutations were M184VI and K65R, while NNRTI mutations were Y181CFGVY, K103N, A98AG, E138GQ and G190AGS. No mayor PI mutations were found.

Due to the high cost of commercial assays, VM and DR analysis is not performed in resource-limited-settings. Objective:: The objective of this study is to develop a pooling based algorithm for the combined identification of virologic treatment failure (VTF) by nucleic acid testing (NAT) and DR by sequencing - NAT+DR assay. Study Design:: We enrolled 559 participants on first-line therapy and analyzed for VTF. The virologically suppressed participants were followed-up to see the VTF prevalence (>1000 copies/mL) and DR by the NAT+DR pooling. Each pool comprising 5 plasma samples were amplified by targeting reverse transcriptase gene, if found positive, the pool was deconvoluted and samples were individually tested for HIV RNA and DR. Assay characteristics of NAT+DR assay were calculated in comparison with commercial assay. Results:: Of 559 participants, 67 had VTF at baseline and were excluded. Of the remaining 478 participants, 325 returned for follow-up and NAT+DR assay was performed for them. Of 65 pools tested, 13 pools were positive. On deconvolution 14 individuals were found to have VTF. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value was 100%, relative efficiency was 59% and 87% & 85% cost was saved for identifying VTF and combined identification of VTF and DR, respectively. Conclusions:: Pooled NAT+DR assay is likely a good strategy to drastically reduce the cost and sustainability of the VM and can thereby facilitate the scale-up of successful HIV treatment programs, and reduce unnecessary switching to second-line drugs in resource-limited-settings.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1386653219301313;5.7;6.0;5.9;13866532;;;

For a subset of patients with serial testing, 50% (2,646/5,290) of those who initially had no reportable DRM subsequently developed 1 DRM for NRTI/NNRTI/PI and 49.7% (159/320) for INSTI. These trends may inform the need for baseline genotypic resistance testing. The detection of treatment-emergent DRMs in serially tested patients confirms the value of genotypic testing following virologic failure.";https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2019.0063;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

Karger AG, Basel.Background: The therapeutic effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is adversely influenced by antiretroviral drug resistance, mainly due to mutations (DRMs) in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genome. These mutations are commonly associated with HIV protease and reverse-transcriptase genes. We sought to determine the frequency of DRMs in a population of ART-experienced patients in the South of Iran. Method: A total of 44 HIV-1-positive participants under ART were selected from April 2016 to March 2017. Their DRMs, antiretroviral resistance status, and viral subtypes were determined. Results: At least one DRM was detected in 61.4% of the participants. The highest frequency was related to nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutations (45.45%). In contrast, major protease inhibitor (PI) mutations had the lowest frequency (6.81%). M184V (40.9%) and K103N (25%), respectively related to NRTI and nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), were the mutations with the highest frequencies. Susceptibility to PI drugs was higher compared to NRTIs and NNRTIs, which was consistent with the results of genotypic DRMs. Conclusion: The highest frequency of antiretroviral DRMs was related to NRTIs and NNRTIs. In contrast, PI resistance mutations had the lowest frequency. Laboratory-guided ART to avoid the expansion of mutants as well as investigating DRMs in other viral regions, such as integrase, are recommended.;https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/501255;2.6;1.9;1.9;03005526;;;

Objectives: We assessed the extent and patterns of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations (DRMs) within the context of the public sector prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programme in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Study design: We conducted analysis of the Pol sub-genomic sequence of RNA extracted from plasma samples of women with probable virological failure at delivery between January and May 2018 from two large maternity centres in the Eastern Cape using standard protocols. Partial pol gene covering 1030bp were amplified and sequenced according to previously reported protocol. DRMs were determined by submitting the generated partial pol sequences to the Stanford drug resistance database for query on mutations associated with drug resistance in HIV viruses. We examined the correlates of DRMs using bivariate analysis. Results: The age of parturient women ranged from 16 to 43 years. The majority of the parturient women were currently on Efavirenz-based regimen (first line ART) (82.5%) and had been on ART for more than 12 months (65.0%). The prevalence of DRMs was 72.5% (n = 58). The CD4 count demonstrated a negative linear association with the DRMs (p = 0.002). The predominant DRMs were K103 N (n = 43; 74.1%), M184 V (n = 28; 48.3%) and K65R (n = 11; 19%). Among the parturient women on EFV-based regimen treatment; 79.1% already had K103 N while nine patients on protease inhibitor-based regimen still harboured K103 N. The majority of the M184 V mutations were observed in parturient women on first line regimen (n = 23; 82.1%). Conclusions: We found a high prevalence of DRMs in women delivering their index babies at high viral loads in the study settings. Drug resistance surveillance using point-of-care reverse transcriptase-PCR strategies for the screening of pregnant women on ART could be a game-changer in the resource-constrained settings.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1386653219301416;5.7;6.0;5.9;13866532;;;

Data Sources: A literature search was performed using PubMed (1966 to January 2019) and Google Scholar (2014 to January 2019) with the search terms dolutegravir, rilpivirine, dual, and switch. Other resources included review articles and the manufacturer product label. Study Selection and Data Extraction: All relevant English-language articles of studies assessing the efficacy and safety of switch therapy to DTG with RPV and review articles were included. Data Synthesis: The fixed-dose combination tablet of DTG and RPV is the first dual therapy approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult patients who have achieved virological suppression for least 6 months on current antiretroviral therapy. This single-tablet regimen is dosed once daily and has been compared with standard triple therapy antiretroviral regimens for safety and efficacy. The dual therapy regimen demonstrated comparable maintenance of virological suppression evaluated up to 100 weeks, with low rates of virological failure. Common adverse effects include headache and diarrhea. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This dual therapy represents an attractive option with a high barrier to resistance in patients without hepatitis B coinfection with adverse effects or significant drug-drug interactions on current therapy, polypharmacy, or end-stage renal disease, who are controlled on triple therapy. Conclusions: This dual therapy combination of DTG-RPV provides maintenance of virological suppression as a switch strategy with few drug interactions and positive effects on lipids and renal and bone health.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1060028019831674;5.7;5.2;4.3;10600280;;;

The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL (defined by the FDA Snapshot approach), with the primary comparison between DOR/3TC/TDF at week 48 and Baseline Regimen at week 24 and a secondary comparison between the groups at week 24 (noninferiority margin, -8%).Results:Six hundred seventy participants (447 DOR/3TC/TDF, 223 Baseline Regimen) were treated and included in the analyses. At week 24, 93.7% on DOR/3TC/TDF vs 94.6% on Baseline Regimen had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL [difference -0.9 (-4.7 to 3.0)]. At week 48, 90.8% on DOR/3TC/TDF had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL, demonstrating noninferiority vs Baseline Regimen at week 24 [difference -3.8 (-7.9 to 0.3)]. In participants on ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor at entry, mean reductions in fasting LDL-C and non-HDL-C at week 24 were significantly greater for DOR/3TC/TDF vs Baseline Regimen (P < 0.0001). Adverse events occurred in 68.9% on DOR/3TC/TDF and 52.5% on Baseline Regimen by week 24, leading to treatment discontinuation in 2.5% and 0.4%, respectively.Conclusions:Switching to once-daily DOR/3TC/TDF is a generally well-tolerated option for maintaining viral suppression in patients considering a change in therapy.Registration:ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02397096.;http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201908010-00015;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

Rilpivirine (RPV, TMC278) is formulated in a low-cost STR with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC). Objectives: Switching at Low HIV-1 RNA into Fixed Dose Combinations (SALIF) compared RPV with efavirenz (EFV), both as STRs with TDF and FTC, in maintaining virologic suppression. Methods: SALIF was a phase 3b, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority study in virologically suppressed adults (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Cameroon, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa, Uganda and Thailand. Patients (N = 426), stratified by NNRTI use, were randomised 1:1 to receive TDF/FTC/RPV (300/200/25 mg qd) or TDF/FTC/EFV (300/200/600 mg qd). Primary endpoint was proportion of patients with virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL) at week 48 (intent-to-treat, modified Food and Drug Administration Snapshot, 10% non-inferiority margin). Results: Patients received TDF/FTC/RPV (n = 213) or TDF/FTC/EFV (n = 211). At week 48, virologic suppression was maintained in 200/213 (93.9%) patients in the RPV arm and 203/211 (96.2%) in the EFV arm (difference –2.3%; 95% confidence interval: -6.4, +1.8), demonstrating non-inferiority of TDF/FTC/RPV. One patient in each arm experienced virologic failure without treatment-emergent resistance. Twenty-seven patients discontinued prematurely (8.0% RPV vs. 4.7% EFV), the most frequent reasons being adverse events (3.3% vs. 0.5%, respectively), site closure (1.9% vs. 0.5%), loss to follow-up (0.9% vs. 1.4%) and consent withdrawal (0.9% vs. 1.4%). Conclusion: In adults with suppressed viral load on first-line NNRTI-based ART in LMICs, switching to an STR of TDF/FTC/RPV was non-inferior to TDF/FTC/EFV in maintaining high rates of viral suppression with a comparable tolerability profile.";http://www.sajhivmed.org.za/index.php/HIVMED/article/view/949;1.6;1.2;1.3;16089693;a949;;

Several studies have identified the occurrence of HIV dual infections in seropositive individuals leading to disease progression. In HICs, however, dual infections with divergent outcomes in pathogenesis have been described. Case presentation: Here, we present a case report of a HIC diagnosed in late 1999 who displayed stable CD4+ T cell levels and low plasmatic viral load across 12 years of follow-up. In early 2013, the patient started to present an increase in viral load, reaching a peak of 10,000 copies/ml in early 2014, followed by an oscillation of viremia at moderate levels in the following years. The genetic diversity of env proviral quasispecies from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was studied by single genome amplification (SGA) at six timepoints across 2009-2017. Phylogenetic analyses of env sequences from 2009 and 2010 samples showed the presence of a single subtype B variant (called B1). Analyses of sequences from 2011 and after revealed an additional subtype B variant (called B2) and a subsequent dominance shift in the proviral quasispecies frequencies, with the B2 variant becoming the most frequent from 2014 onwards. Latent syphilis related to unprotected sexual intercourse was diagnosed a year before the first detection of B2, evidencing risk behavior and supporting the superinfection hypothesis. Immunologic analyses revealed an increase in CD8+ and CD4+ T cell immune activation following viremia increase and minor T cell subset alterations during follow-up. HIV-specific T cell responses remained low throughout the follow-up period. Conclusions: Altogether, these results show that loss of viremia control in the HIC was associated with superinfection. These data alert to the negative consequences of reinfection on HIV pathogenesis, even in patients with a long history of viremia control and an absence of disease progression, reinforcing the need for continued use of adequate prevention strategies.;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-019-4229-3;4.5;4.3;4.1;;588;;

However, it is unable to impact on viral reservoirs, which harbour latent HIV-1 genomes that are able to reignite the infection upon treatment suspension. The aim of this study was to provide an estimate of the safety of the disease-modifying antirheumatic agent auranofin and its impact on the HIV-1 reservoir in humans under intensified ART. For this purpose, an interim analysis was conducted of three of the six arms of the NCT02961829 clinical trial (five patients each) with: no intervention, i.e. continuation of first-line ART; intensified ART (ART + dolutegravir and maraviroc); and intensified ART plus auranofin. Auranofin treatment was found to be well tolerated. No major adverse events were detected apart from a transient decrease in CD4+ T-cell counts at Weeks 8 and 12. Auranofin decreased total viral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with ART-only regimens at Week 20 (P = 0.036) and induced a decrease in integrated viral DNA as quantified by Alu PCR. Despite the limited number of patient-derived sequences available in this study, phylogenetic analyses of nef sequences support the idea that auranofin may impact on the viral reservoir.

However, data from real-life studies using combined longitudinal measurements of cumulative viraemia are scarce. This study aimed to address the independent effect of different ART regimens on HIV cumulative viraemia over the first 12 months after treatment initiation, using programmatic data from the Ministry of Health of Brazil. Methods: Retrospective cohort study analysing cumulative viraemia under the most frequently used ART regimens in Brazil (tenofovir, lamivudine and dolutegravir (regimen 1); tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz (regimen 2); tenofovir, lamivudine and ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (regimen 3)). Results and Discussion: We included 112,243 patients >12 years old who received their first ART prescription between January 2014 and August 2017. Univariate analysis indicated that cumulative viraemia was significantly lower in patients receiving regimen 1 as compared with those receiving regimens 2 or 3 (p<0.0001 for both pairwise comparisons). In a multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex, baseline T CD4+ counts and baseline HIV VL, ART regimen persisted with statistically significant effect on 12-month cumulative viraemia. The model predicted a 45-unit increase in log10 copy-days/mL cumulative viraemia for regimen 2 as compared with regimen 1, and a 70-unit increase in log10 copy-days/mL cumulative viraemia for regimen 3 as compared with regimen 1 (95%CI 41 to 49 and 61 to 79 respectively; p<0.001 for both comparisons). In models restricted to youths (13 to 24 years old) and female patients, ART regimen had similar effects. ART regimen with dolutegravir in association with a tenofovir-lamivudine backbone was superior to regimens containing efavirenz or boosted atazanavir in reducing HIV VL, as shown by cumulative viraemia over the first 12 months after treatment initiation. The superiority persisted even after adjusting the analysis for potential confounders. Conclusions: Our findings could bring direct benefits to patients as suggested by lower viral replication during treatment, lower risk of HIV transmission, and a potential reduction in resistance mutations in the initial 12 months under ART.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jia2.25397;5.5;6.7;7.1;;e25397;;

Led by dolutegravir plus lamivudine, two-drug therapy is emerging as a way to reduce antiretroviral therapy cost and adverse effects without compromising treatment options should virologic failure occur. Initial two-drug therapy has limitations, including the relative incompatibility with the coemerging concept of same-day antiretroviral therapy initiation.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S089155201930039X;8.2;8.9;8.5;08915520;;;

Here, we present efficacy and safety data from the 100-week analysis of the trials. Methods: SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 are identically designed, randomised, open-label phase 3 studies at 65 centres in 13 countries and 60 centres in 11 countries, respectively. Adults aged 18 years or older who were on a standard three-drug or four-drug antiretroviral therapy (ART) and had had fewer than 50 HIV-1 RNA copies per mL of plasma for at least 6 months were randomly assigned (1:1) to 50 mg dolutegravir plus 25 mg rilpivirine orally once daily (early-switch group) or to continue their standard regimen for 52 weeks before switching to the dolutegravir plus rilpivirine combination (ie, the late-switch group). In this analysis of week 100 data, the efficacy endpoint of interest was the proportion of participants with fewer than 50 copies of HIV-1 RNA per mL of plasma (per the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm). This outcome was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of the study drug. Data were analysed after the last participant completed week 100 (Sept 15, 2017) and verified through the data cutoff (Nov 21, 2017). SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02429791 and NCT02422797, respectively. Findings: 513 participants were randomly assigned to dolutegravir plus rilpivirine (ie, the early-switch group) and 511 to continue their standard ART regimen, 477 of whom then switched to dolutegravir plus rilpivirine at week 52 (ie, the late-switch group). At week 100, 456 (89% [95% CI 86–92]) of 513 participants in the early-switch group and 444 (93% [91–95]) of 477 in the late-switch group had fewer than 50 HIV-1 RNA copies per mL. Drug-related adverse events occurred in 103 (20%) participants in the early-switch group and 58 (12%) in the late-switch group. The most common drug-related adverse events were headache (11 participants in the early-switch group [2%] vs eight [2%] in the late-switch group) and nausea (eight [2%] vs five [1%]). Interpretation: The combination of dolutegravir plus rilpivirine sustained virological suppression of HIV-1, was associated with a low frequency of virological failure, and had a favourable safety profile, which support its use as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-sparing and protease inhibitor-sparing alternative to three-drug regimens that reduces overall exposure to ART.

Secondary outcomes included CD4+ cell count change from baseline and safety (adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug-related adverse events) at Week 48.Results:The network contains 14 unique regimens from 14 randomized controlled trials based on data from 10 043 patients. The proportional difference for viral suppression at 48 weeks for DTG + 3TC versus the other 13 regimens included in the network ranged from-2.7% (-11.0, 5.6%) versus DTG + tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (FTC) to 7.3% (0.6, 13.8%) versus efavirenz + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/FTC. DTG + 3TC was found to be significantly better than efavirenz + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/FTC and similar to all other regimens analysed in terms of viral suppression at 48 weeks. With regard to other outcomes (CD4+, adverse event, serious adverse event, drug-related adverse events) at 48 weeks, DTG+3TC was broadly similar to all regimens analysed.Conclusion:This network meta-analysis demonstrates similar efficacy and safety outcomes over 48 weeks with DTG + 3TC compared with traditional 3-drug antiretroviral therapy regimens.;http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201909010-00008;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

Given concerns about side effects, dolutegravir-based and low-dose efavirenz-based combinations have been considered as first-line treatments for HIV-1 in resource-limited settings. METHODS We conducted an open-label, multicenter, randomized, phase 3 noninferiority trial in Cameroon. Adults with HIV-1 infection who had not received antiretroviral therapy and had an HIV-1 RNA level (viral load) of at least 1000 copies per milliliter were randomly assigned to receive either dolutegravir or the reference treatment of low-dose efavirenz (a 400-mg dose, known as EFV400), combined with tenofovir and lamivudine. The primary end point was the proportion of participants with a viral load of less than 50 copies per milliliter at week 48, on the basis of the Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm. The difference between treatment groups was calculated, and noninferiority was tested with a margin of 10 percentage points. RESULTS A total of 613 participants received at least one dose of the assigned regimen. At week 48, a viral load of less than 50 copies per milliliter was observed in 231 of 310 participants (74.5%) in the dolutegravir group and in 209 of 303 participants (69.0%) in the EFV400 group, with a difference of 5.5 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6 to 12.7; P<0.001 for noninferiority). Among those with a baseline viral load of at least 100,000 copies per milliliter, a viral load of less than 50 copies per milliliter was observed in 137 of 207 participants (66.2%) in the dolutegravir group and in 123 of 200 participants (61.5%) in the EFV400 group, with a difference of 4.7 percentage points (95% CI, 4.6 to 14.0). Virologic failure (a viral load of >1000 copies per milliliter) was observed in 3 participants in the dolutegravir group (with none acquiring drug-resistance mutations) and in 16 participants in the EFV400 group. More weight gain was observed in the dolutegravir group than in the EFV400 group (median weight gain, 5.0 kg vs. 3.0 kg; incidence of obesity, 12.3% vs. 5.4%). CONCLUSIONS In HIV-1-infected adults in Cameroon, a dolutegravir-based regimen was noninferior to an EFV400-based reference regimen with regard to viral suppression at week 48. Among participants who had a viral load of at least 100,000 copies per milliliter when antiretroviral therapy was initiated, fewer participants than expected had viral suppression.

Non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the most important factor for therapeutic failure and the development of resistance. Peru has achieved moderate progress in meeting the 90-90-90 targets, but only 60% of PLHIV receiving ART are virally suppressed. The purpose of this study was to understand ART adherence in the Peruvian context, including developing sociodemographic and clinical profiles, evaluating the clinical management strategies, and analyzing the relationships between the variables and adherence of PLHIV managed at a regional HIV clinic in Lambayeque Province (Northern Peru). Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with 180 PLHIV adults, non-randomly but consecutively selected with self-reported ART compliance (78.2% of the eligible population). The PLHIV profile (PLHIV-Pro) and the Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ) were used to collect sociodemographic information, clinical variables, and data specific to ART adherence. Descriptive analysis of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics was performed. Bivariate analysis was performed with the Mann-Whitney test, Chi square test, and Yates correction. Results: The 180 PLHIV sample included 78.9% men, 49.4% heterosexual, 45% with a detectable HIV-1 viral load less than 40 copies/ml, 58.3% not consistently adherent, and only 26.1% receiving Tenofovir + Lamivudine + Efavirenz. Risk factors significant for non-adherence included concurrent tuberculosis, discomfort with the ART regime, and previous pauses in ART. Multivariate analysis of nested models indicated having children is a protector factor for adherence. Conclusions: Self-reported adherence appeared to be low and the use of first-line therapy is not being prescribed homogeneously. Factors associated with nonadherence are both medical and behavioral, such as having tuberculosis, pausing ART, or experiencing discomfort with ART. The Peruvian government needs to update national technical standards, monitor medication availability, and provide education to health care professionals in alignment with evidence-based guidelines and international recommendations. Instruments to measure adherence need to be developed and evaluated for use in Latin America.;https://aidsrestherapy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12981-019-0238-y;3.2;3.8;4.4;;22;;

Usual offending drugs include antiretroviral and antiinfectives, but the burden of specific drug IM-ADRs is population-specific; changing as new and fixed dose combinations enter the market, and drug-resistance patterns demand. This review considers recent literature on epidemiology, mechanisms, clinical management and prevention of IM-ADRs amongst persons living with HIV/AIDS. Recent findings Epidemiological studies continue to describe high rates of delayed hypersensitivity to known offenders, as well as similar reactions in preexposure prophylaxis. IM-ADRs to oral and injectable integrase strand transfer inhibitors are reported with expanding use. The clinical spectrum and management of IM-ADRs occurring in HIV-infected populations is similar to uninfected; with exceptions such as a recently described severe delayed efavirenz Dili with high mortality. Furthermore, the context can be unique, such as the lower than expected mortality in a Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) cohort from a HIV/TB high burden setting. Programmatic data showing the near complete elimination of Abacavir drug hypersensitivity syndrome following implementation of HLA-B57:01 screening is a stellar example of how prevention is possible with mechanistic insight. Summary IM-ADRs remain a challenge in persons living with HIV. The complexities posed by polypharmacy, overlapping drug toxicities, drug interactions, overlap of IM-ADRs with other diseases, limited alternative drugs, and vulnerable patients with advanced immunosuppression with high mortality, necessitate increased use of drug provocation testing, treat-through and desensitization strategies. There is an urgent need for improved diagnostics and predictive biomarkers for prevention, or to guide treat-through, rechallenge and desensitization approaches.";http://journals.lww.com/00130832-201908000-00004;6.6;6.0;5.0;15284050;;;

However, the characteristics of anti-HIV antibody response in the subjects who are treated during chronic HIV-1 infection (CHI) have not yet been fully investigated. Methods: Different anti-HIV antibodies were longitudinally quantified and analyzed in 81 CHI adults under ART. The factors associated with antibody decline were evaluated by binary logistic regression analysis. Results: ART led to 36.0% (27/75) and 52.1% (38/73) of the patients whose anti-HIV levels reduced by more than 75% of the baseline levels at 12 and 24 months post-ART, respectively. The reduction of anti-HIV antibodies correlated with the decline of HIV-1 viral load with correlation coefficients in the range 0.5560.848 or R2 value of 0.5760.873 (P < 0.001). However, no negative detection of anti-HIV antibody was observed at 24 months post-ART. The time from HIV-1 diagnosis to ART initiation and the baseline anti-HIV levels were the key factors associated with quick decline of anti-HIV antibodies during ART. Conclusions: ART-induced kinetics of anti-HIV antibody response was different among the subjects with AHI and CHI. Misdiagnosis of HIV-1 infection may not be a serious issue in HIV-1 chronically infected subjects under ART, and could ideally be avoided by using multiple HIV-1 antigens for screening purposes.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1386653220301566;5.7;6.0;5.9;13866532;104414;;

This is of particular importance among women living in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding this relationship could help elucidate if and how the host immune system interacts with the vaginal microbiome. Methods: The vaginal microbiome of HIV-1/HSV-2-coinfected women (n = 92) in Uganda was evaluated from self-collected vaginal swabs 1 month pre-ART and at 4 and 6 months post-ART initiation. The vaginal microbiome was characterized by 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Vaginal community state types (CSTs) were identified using proportional abundance data. Changes in microbiome composition were assessed with permutational analyses of variance (PerMANOVA). Results: Five vaginal CSTs were identified, which varied significantly by bacterial load (P <. 01): CST-1 was characterized by Lactobacillus iners, CST-2 by Gardnerella, CST-3 by Gardnerella and Prevotella, CST-4 by Lactobacillus crispatus, and CST-5 was highly diverse. Vaginal microbiome composition also did not change significantly after ART initiation (P =. 985).

Areas covered: This review covers the latest trend of NNRTIs regarding their pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of drug action, drug resistance as well as new applications such as two-drug regimens and long-acting formulations. Expert opinion: Since the first NNRTI, nevirapine, was approved in 1996, antiviral drug discovery led to the approval of seven NNRTIs, including nevirapine, delavirdine (discontinued), etravirine, elsulfavirine, efavirenz, rilpivirine, and doravirine. The latter three compounds with favorable pharmacodynamic profiles and minimal adverse effects are often combined with one integrase inhibitor or two NRTIs in once-daily fixed-dose tablets. NNRTI-anchored regimens have been approved as initial therapies in treatment-naïve patients (efficacy: 72% to 86%) or maintaining therapies in virologically-suppressed patients (efficacy: 91% to 95%). Future development of NNRTIs includes: (i) better resistance and cross-resistance profiles; (ii) reduction of drug burden by optimizing two-drug or three-drug combinations; and (iii) improvement of patient adherence by novel long-acting formulations with weekly or monthly administration. Overall, NNRTIs play an important role in the management of HIV-1 infections, especially in resource-limited countries.";https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17425255.2019.1673367;5.7;5.9;6.4;17425255;;;

Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.This study sought to examine the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genetic diversity on drug resistance among men who have sex with men (MSM) with virologic failure in antiretroviral therapy (ART), and investigate linking-associated factors for genetic transmission networks.Seven hundred and thirty-four HIV-positive MSM with virologic failure in ART were recruited into our study from 2011 to 2017. HIV-1 pol gene sequences were used for phylogenetic and genotypic drug resistance analyses. The drug resistance mutations were determined using the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database. The genetic transmission networks were analyzed for CRF01-AE and CRF07-BC sequences by the genetic distance-based method.Of 734 subjects, 372 (50.68%) showed drug resistance, in which CRF01-AE and CRF07-BC were the predominating subtypes. Drug resistance more frequently occurred in non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) treatment (48.64%), and followed by nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (36.51%) and PIs (4.03%). The most common drug resistance-associated mutations in protease inhibitors (PIs), NRTIs and NNRTIs were K20I/R, M184V/I and K103N/KN, respectively. For 283CRF01-AE sequences, 64 (22.61%) fell into clusters at a genetic distance of 0.011, resulting in 17 clusters ranging in size from 2 to 16 individuals. For 230 CRF07-BC sequences, 66 (28.69%) were connected to at least one other sequence with 0.005 genetic distances, resulting in 8 clusters ranging in size from 2 to 52 individuals. Individuals who showed drug resistance to ART were less likely to fall into clusters than those who did not. The genetic linkage was robust by the exclusion of sites associated with drug resistance.CRF01-AE and CRF07-BC were the main strains among MSM with virologic failure in ART, and the drug resistance more frequently occurred in NNRTIs, followed by NRTIs and PIs. Genetic transmission networks revealed a complexity of transmission pattern, suggesting early-diagnosis and in-time intervention among MSM.;http://journals.lww.com/00005792-201910250-00032;2.1;2.7;2.7;00257974;e17585;;

Using routinely collected data, we conducted a retrospective study to describe the prevalence of CVD risk factors among a cohort of HIV-infected patients followed for over 10 years in Port-au Prince, Haiti. This cohort includes 910 adults who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) between 2003 and 2004 and remained in care between 2014 and 2016 when routine screening for CVD risk factors was implemented at a large clinic in Haiti. A total of 397 remained in care 10 years and received screening. At ART initiation, 59% were female, median age was 38 years (IQR 33-44), and median CD4 count was 117 cells/mm3 (IQR 34-201). Median follow-up time from ART initiation was 12.1 years (IQR 11.7-12.7). At screening, median CD4 count was 574 cells/mm3 (IQR 378-771), and 84% (282 of 336 screened) had HIV-1 RNA < 1000 copies/mL. Seventy-four percent of patients had at least 1 risk factor including 58% (224/385) with hypertension, 8% (24/297) diabetes, 43% (119/275) hypercholesterolemia, 8% (20/248) active smoking, and 10% (25/245) obesity. Factors associated with hypertension were age (adjusted OR 1.06, P <.001) and weight at screening (adjusted OR 1.02, P =.019). Long-term AIDS survivors have a high prevalence of CVD risk factors, primarily hypertension. Integration of cardiovascular screening and management into routine HIV care is needed to maximize health outcomes among aging HIV patients in resource-limited settings.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jch.13663;4.3;3.8;4.0;15246175;;;

All rights reserved.Background: There is an increasing interest in two-drug regimens. We hypothesized that maintenance therapy with raltegravir and lamivudine would keep HIV-1 suppressed and be well tolerated. Methods: Virally suppressed HIV-1-infected adults without previous viral failures or known resistance mutations to integrase inhibitors or 3TC/FTC or chronic hepatitis B were randomized 2:1 to switch to fixed-dose combination 150mg lamivudine/300mg raltegravir twice daily or to continue therapy. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients free of therapeutic failure (defined as viral failure, change in treatment for any reason, consent withdrawal, loss to follow-up or death) at week 24. Secondary outcomes were changes in laboratory, body composition, sleep quality, adherence, and adverse effects. Results: There were 75 patients included: men 78%; median age 50 years; median CD4+ 622/l. At week 24, 7 (9%) patients had therapeutic failure: raltegravir and lamivudine 2 (4%) vs. control 5 (20%). The difference in proportions of therapeutic failures raltegravir and lamivudine minus control was -0.159 (95% confidence interval: -0.353 to -0.012). There was a trend to more weight gain with raltegravir and lamivudine, but no significant changes in other secondary outcomes. Sixty-four percent of patients in each arm had at least one adverse effect. Two (6%) patients in control arm and 4 (7%) patients in raltegravir and lamivudine arm had severe adverse effects. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that switching to raltegravir along with lamivudine in patients with viral suppression maintains efficacy and is well tolerated. A larger study of longer duration is required to confirm these findings.";http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201910010-00009;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;

So, we examined potential correlation between vitamin D status and atherosclerosis in people living with HIV. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed including adult HIV-infected patients on stable antiretroviral therapy, aged 40–60 years, and with a recent carotid ultrasonography. Subclinical atherosclerosis was defined as a carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) 0.9 mm at any site. Patients with diabetes mellitus or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were excluded. Results: On the whole, 188 patients were enrolled: 86.2% were men and the mean age was 49.1 years. The mean CD4 T lymphocyte count was 567 cells/mm3, 176 (93.6%) had plasma HIV RNA <20 copies/mL, 51.1% were smoker, 29.2% had hypertension, 27.7% metabolic syndrome, and 44.7% LDL cholesterol >150 mg/dL. The mean serum concentration of vitamin D was 35.2 ng/mL, and 84 (44.6%) patients had a vitamin D insufficiency (<30 ng/mL). Subclinical atherosclerosis was reported in 105 (55.8%) and the mean vitamin D concentration was significantly lower among patients with subclinical atherosclerosis than among those without (18.2 vs 41.3 ng/mL, p < 0.001). Moreover, the multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted by confounding factors showed an independent association between subclinical atherosclerosis and vitamin D insufficiency, age >50 years, smoking, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, higher BMI, higher LDL cholesterol, longer duration of HIV infection, lower nadir CD4 cell count, and longer exposure to boosted protease inhibitors. Conclusion: In our study, vitamin D insufficiency is significantly associated with subclinical atherosclerosis, so its role in HIV-associated cardiovascular disease should be further evaluated as a possible target for intervention.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/25787489.2020.1724749;0;0;0.1;25787489;;;

Herein we present a case of a heavily treated HIV-infected man in whom antiretroviral toxicity had been observed. The lopinavir/ritonavir plasma concentrations at standard doses were significantly above the recommended levels. Pharmacogenetic analysis revealed a polymorphism in the DRD3 gene associated with a decrease in the rate of drug metabolism. Additionally, the patient’s low body mass index could have contributed to a greater degree of patient exposure to the drug. After the withdrawal of tenofovir disoproxil and the establishment of individualized protease inhibitor monotherapy at reduced doses, a decrease in the intensity of adverse events was observed, while the clinical outcomes were maintained. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacogenetic analysis was shown to be a tool of huge interest for the management and durability of antiretroviral therapy.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40261-019-00829-x;3.7;3.5;3.9;11732563;;;

Based on the levels of HIV-1 DNA in naive (TN) vs resting memory CD4+ T cells, it is widely hypothesized that this reservoir resides primarily within memory cells. Here, we compared virus production from TN and central memory (TCM) CD4+ T cells isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals on suppressive therapy. Methods: CD4+ TN and TCM cells were purified from the blood of 7 HIV-1-infected individuals. We quantified total HIV-1 DNA in the CD4+ TN and TCM cells. Extracellular virion-associated HIV-1 RNA or viral outgrowth assays were used to assess latency reversal following treatment with anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), phytohaemagglutinin/interleukin-2, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin, prostratin, panobinostat, or romidepsin. Results: HIV-1 DNA was significantly higher in TCM compared to TN cells (2179 vs 684 copies/106 cells, respectively). Following exposure to anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs, virion-associated HIV-1 RNA levels were similar between TCM and TN cells (15 135 vs 18 290 copies/mL, respectively). In 4/7 donors, virus production was higher for TN cells independent of the latency reversing agent used. Replication-competent virus was recovered from both TN and TCM cells. Conclusions: Although the frequency of HIV-1 infection is lower in TN compared to TCM cells, as much virus is produced from the TN population after latency reversal. This finding suggests that quantifying HIV-1 DNA alone may not predict the size of the inducible latent reservoir and that TN cells may be an important reservoir of latent HIV-1.;https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/69/11/1919/5308425;14.0;13.8;12.5;10584838;;;

The trajectory of HIV-related inflammation may vary with the timing of ART initiation. We examined immune activation markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood specimens collected over 96 weeks from participants who initiated ART during acute HIV infection (AHI). Methods: RV254/SEARCH010 study participants with AHI underwent CSF (n = 89) and plasma (n = 146) sampling before initiating ART and at weeks 24 and 96 of treatment. A majority participants (64.4%) received a standard ART regimen (hereafter, ""standard ART""), with some (34.7%) also receiving maraviroc and raltegravir for the first 24 weeks (hereafter, ""ART plus""). We compared neopterin, CXCL10, CCL2, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels in the AHI group to those in 18 healthy, uninfected controls. Results: Following 24 and 96 weeks of treatment, levels of all CSF markers normalized while levels of several plasma markers remained elevated in the AHI group (P <. 001). Participants receiving the ART-plus regimen had lower median plasma CCL2 levels at week 24 and lower plasma neopterin levels at week 96. Conclusions: ART initiation during AHI differentially impacts the brain compartment, with markers of inflammation returning to normal levels in the CSF, where they were sustained at week 96, but not in plasma.";https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/220/12/1885/5298345;10.4;9.2;9.0;00221899;;;

Setting and methods: Cross-sectional study conducted in the Chantal BIYA International Reference Centre for research on HIV/AIDS prevention and management (CIRCB), Yaoundé, Cameroon; data generated between October 2016 and August 2017 amongst adults, adolescents and children at 12, 24, 36 and  48 months on ART. VS was defined as < 1000 copies/mL of blood plasma and controlled viremia as VL < 50 copies/mL. Data were analysed by SPSS; p < 0.05 considered as significant. Results: 1946 patients (70% female) were enrolled (1800 adults, 105 adolescents, 41 children); 1841 were on NNRTI-based and 105 on PI-based therapy; with 346 patients at M12, 270 at M24, 205 at M36 and 1125 at  M48. The median (IQR) duration on was 48 months (24-48). Overall, VS was 79.4% (95% CI 77.6-81.2) and 67.1% (95% CI 64.9-69.1) had controlled viral replication. On NNRTI-based, VS was 79.9% vs. 71.4% on PIs-based, p = 0.003. By ART duration, VS was 84.1% (M12), 85.9% (M24), 75.1% (M36) and 77.2% ( M48), p = 0.001. By age, VS was 75.6% (children), 53.3% (adolescents) and 81.1% (adults), p < 0.001. Conclusions: In this sub-population of patients receiving ART in Cameroon, about 80% might be experiencing VS, with declining performance at adolescence, with NNRTI-based regimens, and as from 36 months on ART. Thus, improving VS may require an adapted adherence support mechanism, especially for adolescents with long-term treatment in resource-limited settings.";https://aidsrestherapy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12981-019-0252-0;3.2;3.8;4.4;;36;;

After the introduction of ART, several studies have demonstrated comparable patient and graft outcomes between HIV-negative and HIV-positive kidney recipients. The US Congress passed the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act in 2013, which permits research in the area of HIV-positive to HIV-positive transplantation. HIV-infected living donation is also permitted under the HOPE Act. However, there is a concern regarding the safety of kidney donation in an HIV-infected person, given the risk of renal disease associated with HIV infection. We report here the case of successful kidney transplantation from HIV-positive living donor to HIV-positive recipient performed in our center on July 2012. To the best of our knowledge, this is the earliest case done in this medical context to be reported in the literature, therefore, potentially carrying several important messages to the transplantation community. In the present case, the living-donor kidney transplant was performed between a married couple infected with same strain of HIV-1, both on effective ART with efficiently suppressed viral replication and satisfactory pre-transplantation immune status.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tid.13171;3.2;2.9;3.1;13982273;e13171;;

Here, we identify a subset of lymphoid organ sinus lining macrophage (SMs) that provide a cell-cell contact portal, which facilitates the uptake of HIV-1 viral-like particles (VLPs) by FDCs and B cells in mouse lymph node. Central for portal function is the bridging glycoprotein MFG-E8. Using a phosphatidylserine binding domain and an RGD motif, MFG-E8 helps target HIV-1 VLPs to v integrin bearing SMs. Lack of MFG-E8 or integrin blockade severely limits HIV-1 VLP spread onto FDC networks. Direct SM-FDC virion transfer also depends upon short-lived FDC network abutment, likely triggered by SCSM antigen uptake. This provides a mechanism for rapid FDC loading broadening the opportunity for rare, antigen reactive follicular B cells to acquire antigen, and a means for HIV virions to accumulate on the FDC network.;https://elifesciences.org/articles/47776;10.0;10.8;10.8;;e47776;;

Doravirine achieved non-inferiority when compared with efavirenz- and darunavir/ritonavir-based regimens. Fewer adverse effects, including neuropsychiatric effects were observed with doravirine compared with efavirenz. Key pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics as well as drug–drug interactions and the resistance profile were assessed in this clinical review. Doravirine is a pyridinone NNRTI with potent antiviral activity against wild-type HIV-1 virus and common NNRTI variants. Studies in healthy volunteers and HIV-infected individuals have shown that doravirine has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile for once-daily dosing, with an elimination half-life of around 15 h, median time to maximum plasma concentrations of 1–4 h, and time to steady-state concentration of 7 days. The pharmacokinetics of doravirine are not greatly influenced by sex, age, race, or hepatic impairment. Although no dose adjustment is required for doravirine in renal impairment when given as a single tablet, the fixed-dose combination tablet of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance of < 50 mL/min. Doravirine has a low potential for drug–drug interactions and does not impact on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs. However, it is metabolized via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A enzymes and is thus susceptible to interactions with CYP3A inhibitors and inducers. Strong CYP3A inhibitors can significantly increase doravirine exposure; however, this is not considered to be clinically relevant. Conversely, strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, are contraindicated with doravirine owing to a significant reduction in exposure with potential for impaired virological efficacy. Moderate CYP3A inducers, such as rifabutin, may be co-administered if the doravirine dose is increased to 100 mg twice daily. Doravirine has a unique resistance profile and has demonstrated in vitro activity against some of the most common, clinically relevant NNRTI-resistant mutations. Prevalence of baseline NNRTI resistance to doravirine appears to be low in treatment-naïve cohorts. Further data on the efficacy of doravirine in patients with previous treatment experience and/or transmitted NNRTI resistance are required to further inform its place in the current armamentarium of drugs for the treatment of HIV infection.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40262-019-00806-9;8.5;8.2;8.8;03125963;;;

Resident memory T cells (TRM) are present in tissues such as the lower female genital tract, but the contribution of this subset of cells to the pathogenesis and persistence of HIV remains unclear. Here, we show that cervical CD4+TRM display a unique repertoire of clusters of differentiation, with enrichment of several molecules associated with HIV infection susceptibility, longevity and self-renewing capacities. These protein profiles are enriched in a fraction of CD4+TRM expressing CD32. Cervical explant models show that CD4+TRM preferentially support HIV infection and harbor more viral DNA and protein than non-TRM. Importantly, cervical tissue from ART-suppressed HIV+ women contain high levels of viral DNA and RNA, being the TRM fraction the principal contributor. These results recognize the lower female genital tract as an HIV sanctuary and identify CD4+TRM as primary targets of HIV infection and viral persistence. Thus, strategies towards an HIV cure will need to consider TRM phenotypes, which are widely distributed in tissues.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12732-2;18.5;18.1;18.1;;4739;;

Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional survey with a two-stage cluster sampling was conducted from March to November 2016. Nineteen of 45 total ART clinics representing >90% of the national cohort of adults on ART were included. ART initiators were defined as PLHIV initiating or reinitiating first-line ART. HIVDR was assessed for protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase Sanger sequences using the Stanford HIVdb algorithm. Viral load (VL) suppression was defined as <1000 copies/mL. Results were weighted according to the survey design. Results and discussion: A total of 638 participants were enrolled (PDR: 171; ADR12: 114; ADR48: 353). The proportion of ART initiators with prior exposure to antiretrovirals (ARVs) was 12.3% (95% CI: 5.8% to 24.3%). PDR prevalence to any drug was 23.4% (95% CI: 14.4% to 35.6%), and 19.3% (95% CI: 12.2% to 29.1%) to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). NNRTI PDR was higher in ART initiators with previous ARV exposure compared with those with no exposure (76.2% vs. 11.0%, p < 0.001). Protease inhibitors (PI) and integrase strand transfer inhibitors PDR was not observed. VL suppression rate was 77.8% (95% CI: 67.1% to 85.8%) in ADR12 and 70.3% (95% CI: 66.7% to 73.8%) in ADR48. ADR12 prevalence to any drug among PLHIV without VL suppression was 85.1% (95% CI: 66.1% to 94.4%), 82.4% to NNRTI and 70.2% to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). ADR48 prevalence to any drug among PLHIV without VL suppression was 75.5% (95% CI: 63.5% to 84.5 %), 70.7% to NNRTI, 59.4% to NRTI and 4.6% to PI. Conclusions: Despite implementation challenges yielding low-precision HIVDR estimates, high rates of NNRTI PDR were observed in Nicaragua, suggesting consideration of non-NNRTI-based first-line regimens for ART initiators. Strengthened HIVDR monitoring, systematic VL testing, and improved ART adherence support are also warranted.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jia2.25429;5.5;6.7;7.1;;e25429;;

However, few studies have observed the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases and carotid thickness in HIV-positive population at low cardiovascular risk and with undetectable viral load. Objectives: To evaluate the association between levels of inflammatory markers and carotid thickness in people living with HIV, under antiretroviral therapy and at low cardiovascular risk. Methods: To determine low cardiovascular risk in both groups (HIV infected and non-infected individuals), the Framingham Risk Score was used. Inflammatory markers (IFN-, TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, sVCAM-1, and sICAM-1) were assessed using flow cytometry. Carotid thickness (mm) was measured using Doppler ultrasound. Level of significance was p < 0.05. Results: In People living with HIV, age and smoking status were associated with carotid thickness alterations. In the non-HIV group, age, higher total cholesterol, and LDL levels were associated with increased carotid thickness. Using the multivariate analysis, a significant association between TNF- and IL-1 levels, and a higher chance of atherosclerosis development in HIV group were observed. Conclusions: Both groups have a similar risk for developing cardiovascular disease, therefore our study demonstrates that HIV-positive individuals with undetectable viral load in antiretroviral therapy without protease inhibitors and with low cardiovascular risk do not present differences in carotid thickness in relation to uninfected individuals.

HIV Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British HIV AssociationObjectives: The current World Health Organization and Uganda Ministry of Health HIV treatment guidelines recommend that asymptomatic patients who have a viral load (VL)  1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL should receive adherence counselling and repeat VL testing before switching to second-line therapy. We evaluated the effectiveness of this strategy in a large HIV treatment programme of The AIDS Support Organisation Jinja in Jinja, Uganda. Methods: We measured the HIV VL at enrolment, and for participants with VL  1000 copies/mL we informed them of their result, offered enhanced adherence counselling and repeated the VL measurement after 3 months. All blood samples with VL  1000 copies/mL were sequenced in the polymerase (pol) region, a 1257-bp fragment spanning the protease and reverse transcriptase genes. Results: One thousand and ninety-one participants were enrolled in the study; 74.7% were female and the median age was 44 years [interquartile range (IQR) 39–50 years]. The median time on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at enrolment was 6.75 years (IQR 5.3–7.6 years) and the median CD4 cell count was 494 cells/L (IQR 351–691 cells/L). A total of 113 participants (10.4%) had VLs  1000 copies/mL and were informed of the VL result and its implications and given adherence counselling. Of these 113 participants, 102 completed 3 months of follow-up and 93 (91%) still had VLs  1000 copies/mL. We successfully genotyped HIV for 105 patients (93%) and found that 103 (98%) had at least one mutation: eight (7.6%) had only one mutation, 94 (89.5%) had two mutations and one sample (1%) had three mutations. Conclusions: In this study, enhanced adherence counselling was not effective in reversing virologically defined treatment failure for patients on long-term ART who had not previously had a VL test.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hiv.12790;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;

We describe these evolutions of PHI patients diagnosed in France from 2014 to 2016. Methods: A total of 1121 PHI patients were included. TDRAMs were characterized using the 2009 Stanford list and the French ANRS algorithm. Viral subtypes and recent transmission clusters (RTCs) were also determined. Results: Patients were mainly MSM (70%) living in the Paris area (42%). TDRAMs were identified among 10.8% of patients and rose to 18.6% when including etravirine and rilpivirine TDRAMs. Prevalences of PI-, NRTI-, first-generation NNRTI-, second-generation NNRTI- A nd integrase inhibitor-associated TDRAMs were 2.9%, 5.0%, 4.0%, 9.4% and 5.4%, respectively. In a multivariable analysis, age >40 years and non-R5 tropic viruses were associated with a >2-fold increased risk of TDRAMs. Regarding HIV diversity, subtype B and CRF02_AG (where CRF stands for circulating recombinant form) were the two main lineages (56% and 20%, respectively). CRF02_AG was associated with higher viral load than subtype B (5.83 versus 5.40 log10 copies/mL, P=0.004). We identified 138 RTCs ranging from 2 to 14 patients and including overall 41% from the global population. Patients in RTCs were younger, more frequently born in France and more frequently MSM. Conclusions: Since 2007, the proportion of TDRAMs has been stable among French PHI patients. Non-B lineages are increasing and may be associated with more virulent CRF02_AG strains. The presence of large RTCs highlights the need for real-time cluster identification to trigger specific prevention action to achieve better control of the epidemic.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jac/dkz404/5602627;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

Methods: HIV-1 RNA was extracted from plasma derived from a MSM population. The reverse transcription and nested PCR amplification were performed following our in-house PCR procedure. Genotyping and drug resistant-associated mutations and polymorphisms were identified based on polygenetic analyses and the usage of the HIV Drug Resistance Database, respectively. Results: A total of 9.24 % of the identified CRF55_01B sequences bear the primary drug resistance. CRF55_01B contains polymorphisms I13I/V, G16E and E35D that differ from those in CRF01_AE. Among the 11 polymorphisms in the RT region, seven were statistically different from CRF01_AE’s. Another three polymorphisms, R211K (98.3%), F214L (98.3%), and V245A/E (98.3 %.), were identified in the RT region and they all were statistically different with that of the subtype B.

Few new generation sequencing data are available. Objective: To check that the automated deep sequencing Sentosa platform (Vela DX) detected minority resistant variants well enough for HIV DNA genotyping. Study design: We evaluated the Sentosa SQ HIV genotyping assay with automated extraction on 40 DNA longitudinal samples from treatment-experienced patients by comparison with Sanger sequencing. HIV drug resistance was interpreted using the ANRS algorithm (v29) at the threshold of 20 % and 3 %. Results: The Sentosa SQ HIV genotyping assay was 100 % successful to amplify and sequence PR and RT and 86 % to amplify and sequence IN when the HIV DNA load was >2.5 log copies/million cells. The Sentosa and Sanger sequencing were concordant for predicting PR-RT resistance at the threshold of 20 % in 14/18 samples successfully sequenced. A higher level of resistance was predicted by Sentosa in three samples and by Sanger in one sample. The prevalence of resistance was 7 % to PI, 59 % to NRTI, 31 % to NNRTI and 20 % to integrase inhibitors using the Sentosa SQ genotyping assay at the threshold of 3 %. Seven additional mutations <20 % were detected using the Sentosa assay. Conclusion: Automated DNA extraction and sequencing using the Sentosa SQ HIV genotyping assay accurately predicted HIV DNA drug resistance by comparison with Sanger. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the clinical interest of HIV DNA genotyping.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1386653219302598;5.7;6.0;5.9;13866532;104229;;

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Background: Despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), many HIV-infected individuals have low-level persistent immune activation in the central nervous system (CNS). There have been concerns regarding the CNS efficacy of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) because of its low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations and because it is a substrate of the active efflux transporter P-glycoprotein. Our aim was to investigate whether switching from emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC) to FTC/TAF would lead to changes in residual intrathecal immune activation, viral load, or neurocognitive function. Methods: Twenty HIV-1-infected neuro-asymptomatic adults (11 on ABC/3TC and 9 on FTC/TDF) were included in this prospective study. At baseline, all participants changed their nucleoside analogues to FTC/TAF without any other changes in their ART regimen. We performed lumbar punctures, venipunctures, and neurocognitive testing at baseline and after three and 12 months. Results: During follow-up, there were no significant changes in CSF or plasma HIV RNA, CSF neopterin, CSF 2-microglobulin, IgG index, albumin ratio, CSF NFL, or neurocognitive function in assessed by Cogstate in any of the groups. Conclusion: This small pilot study indicates that switching to FTC/TAF from ABC/3TC or FTC/TDF has neither a positive, nor a negative effect on the HIV infection in the CNS.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23744235.2019.1670352;3.3;3.7;4.0;23744235;;;

Dolutegravir-based 2-drug regimens (DTG 2DRs) are now accepted as alternatives to 3-drug regimens for HIV antiretroviral treatment (ART); however, literature on physician drivers for prescribing DTG 2DR is sparse. This study evaluated treatment patterns of DTG 2DR components in clinical practice in the US. Methods. This was a retrospective chart review in adult patients in care in the US with HIV-1 who received DTG 2DR prior to July 31, 2017, with follow-up until January 30, 2018. Primary objectives of the study were to determine reasons for patients initiating DTG 2DR and to describe the demographics and clinical characteristics. All analyses were descriptive. Results. Overall, 278 patients received DTG 2DR (male: 70%; mean age: 56 years). Most patients were treatment experienced (98%), with a mean 13.5 years of prior ART. DTG was most commonly paired with darunavir (55%) or rilpivirine (27%). The most common physician-reported reasons for initiating DTG 2DR were treatment simplification/streamlining (30%) and avoidance of potential long-term toxicities (20%). Before starting DTG 2DR, 42% of patients were virologically suppressed; of those, 95% maintained suppression while on DTG 2DR. Of the 50% of patients with detectable viral load before DTG 2DR, 79% achieved and maintained virologic suppression on DTG 2DR during follow-up. There were no virologic data for 8% of patients prior to starting DTG 2DR. Only 15 patients discontinued DTG 2DR, of whom 4 (27%) discontinued due to virologic failure. Conclusions. Prior to commercial availability of the single-tablet 2DRs, DTG 2DR components were primarily used in treatment-experienced patients for treatment simplification and avoidance of long-term toxicities. Many of these patients achieved and maintained virologic suppression, with low discontinuation rates.";https://www.hindawi.com/journals/art/2020/5923256/;2.5;2.2;3.2;20901240;5923256;;

The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DTG (DTG + TDF/3TC) compared to efavirenz (EFV + TDF/3TC) in treatment-naive and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r + TDF/3TC) in first-line ART failure HIV-1-infected patients in China. Methods: A dynamic Markov model comprising of 5 response states and 6 CD4+ count-based health states was used. Efficacy, estimated as probability of virologic suppression (HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL) at 48 weeks, was obtained from a published network meta-analysis for ART-naive patients and from the DAWNING study for patients failing first-line ART. Baseline cohort characteristics were informed using DTG phase 3 studies and the DAWNING study data, respectively. Health state utilities were derived from DTG phase 3 studies. A 5-year cost-effectiveness analyses was conducted using the societal perspective. Outcomes were quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs), life-years (LYs), incremental cost per QALYs (ICER). Results: The viral suppression rates for DTG + TDF/3TC were higher than EFV + TDF/3TC (75.3% vs 64.0%) in treatment-naive and LPV/r + TDF/3TC (74.8% vs 58.4%) in first-line ART failure patients. This resulted in higher QALYs for DTG + TDF/3TC in treatment-naive (4.232 vs 4.227) and first-line failure settings (4.224 vs 4.221). Total discounted cost for DTG + TDF/3TC patients (RMB 219.259 in treatment-naive and RMB 238,746 in first-line failures) were lower than comparators (EFV + TDF/3TC:RMB 221,605; LPV/r + TDF/3TC:RMB 244,364), thereby DTG dominated in both settings. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated the probability of DTG + TDF/3TC being cost effective was 98.2% in treatment-naive setting and 100% in first-line failure setting at a willingness to pay threshold of RMB 100,000/QALY. Conclusions: With lower costs, higher response rates and higher QALYs, DTG + TDF/3TC can be considered as a cost-effective alternative for treatment naive and first-line failure patients in China.";https://resource-allocation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12962-019-0195-2;3.2;1.8;1.9;;26;;

The current study aimed at assessing the prevalence of HIV-1 DRMs among naïve and treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients in Iran. Methods From April 2013 to September 2018, the HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase genes were amplified and sequenced in plasma specimens of 60 newly diagnosed antiretroviralnaive individuals and 46 participants receiving antiretroviral therapies (ARTs) for at least six months with an HIV viral load of more than 1000 IU/mL to determine the HIV-1 DRMs and subtypes. Results Among the 60 treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected participants, 8.3% were infected with HIV-1 variants with surveillance DRMs (SDRMs). The SDRMs, D67N and D67E, belonged to the NRTIs class in two patients and K103N and V106A belonged to the NNRTIs class in three patients. The phylogenetic analysis showed that 91.7% of the subjects were infected with subtype CRF35_AD, followed by subtype B (5.0%) and CRF01_AE (3.3%). Among the 46 ART-experienced participants, 33 (71.7%) carried HIV-1 variants with SDRMs (9.1% against PIs, 78.8% against NRTIs, and 100% against NNRTIs). M46I and I47V were the most common mutations for PIs, M184V was the most common mutation for the NRTIs, and K103N/S was the most common mutation for NNRTIs. Phylogenetic analysis of the polymerase region showed that all of the 46 HIV-1-infected patients who failed on ART carried CRF35_AD. Conclusions The moderate prevalence of SDRMs (8.3%) in treatment-naïve and ART-failed (77.1%) Iranian patients with HIV-1-infection emphasizes the need for systematic viral load monitoring, expanding drug resistance testing, carefully surveilling individuals on ART regimens, and facilitating access to new antiretrovirals by health authorities.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229275;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0229275;;

In view of the fast viremia decline obtained with integrase inhibitors, we studied the respective effects of initiating efavirenz (EFV) or raltegravir (RAL)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels and inflammation biomarkers in the highly inflammatory setting of advanced HIV-1 disease with tuberculosis (TB) coinfection. Methods. We followed cell-associated HIV-1 DNA, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), soluble CD14 and D-Dimer levels for 48 weeks after ART initiation in the participants to the ANRS12-180 REFLATE-TB study. This phase II open-label randomized study included ART-naive people with HIV and TB treated with rifampicin to receive RAL 400 mg twice daily (RAL400), RAL 800 mg twice daily (RAL800) or EFV 600 mg QD with tenofovir and lamivudine. Results. In 146 participants, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) week (W)0 HIV-1 DNA level was 4.7 (IQR, 4.3–5.1) log10 copies/106 CD4+, and the reduction by W48 was 0.8 log10 copies/106 CD4+ on EFV, 0.9 on RAL400, and 1.0 on RAL800 (P = .74). Baseline median (IQR) hsCRP, IL-6, sCD14, and D-Dimer levels were 6.9 (IQR, 3.3–15.6) mg/L, 7.3 (IQR, 3.5–12.3) pg/mL, 3221 (IQR, 2383–4130) ng/mL, and 975 (IQR, 535–1970) ng/mL. All biomarker levels decreased over the study: the overall W0–W48 mean (95% confidence interval) fold-change on ART was 0.37 (IQR, 0.28–0.48) for hsCRP, 0.42 (IQR, 0.35–0.51) for IL-6, 0.51 (IQR, 0.47–0.56) for sCD14, and 0.39 (IQR, 0.32–0.47) for D-Dimers. There were no differences in biomarker reduction across treatment arms. Conclusions. In participants with HIV and TB, EFV, RAL400, or RAL800 effectively and equally reduced inflammation and HIV-1 DNA levels.;https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofz549/5700746;3.5;4.6;3.8;;ofz549;;

In line with UNAIDS recommendations extending ART to all HIV-infected individuals, we conducted this demonstration project on immediate treatment as prevention (TasP) among FSWs in Cotonou, Benin. We report data on treatment response and its relation to adherence, as well as on ART-resistant genotypes. Methods Complete follow-up varied between 12 and 24 months. At each three-monthly visit, a questionnaire was administered, clinical examinations were carried out and blood samples collected. Adherence to treatment was estimated by self-report. Viral RNA was genotyped at baseline and final visits for drug resistance. Generalized estimating equations for repeated measures with a log-binomial link were used to analyze time trends and the association between adherence and virological response to treatment. Results One-hundred-seven HIV-positive and ART-naive FSWs were enrolled; 59.8% remained in the cohort till study completion and 62.6% had a final visit. Viral load<1000 (below quantification limit [<50]) was attained in 73.1% (64.6%) of participants at month-6, 84.8% (71.2%) at month-12, and 80.9% (65.1%) at the final visit. The proportion of women with suppressed (below quantification limit) viral load increased with increasing self-reported adherence (p = 0.06 (0.003), tests for trend). The proportion of participants with CD4500 also decreased drastically throughout follow-up (p < .0001). Twelve participants exhibited ART-resistant genotypes at baseline, but only two at their final visit.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0227184;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0227184;;

Here, we described a case of transmitted as well as acquired HIV drug resistance among a father, mother and infant. Epidemiological data were obtained retrospectively. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) of three patients were tested using a validated In-house Sanger-based sequencing (SBS) method and the Vela next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform. Gene evolution analysis was also performed. According to the epidemiological history and phylogenetic data, in late preg-nancy of the mother, the infant’s father transmitted HIV-1 to her, and then the mother to the baby, leading to the transmission of V106I as a common mutation of three persons. The mutant frequency was 99.57% (father), 95.38% (mother) and 99.73% (infant), respectively. Mother also acquired K101E (41.03%), K103N (27.56%) and minor mutation of V106M (4.30%) after improperly discontinuing antiretroviral regimen of lamivudine (3TC), tenofovir (TDF) and efavirenz (EFV). Such acquired mutations increased the drug resistance scores on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) doravirine, EFV, etravirine, nevir-apine and rilpivirine from 10, 0, 10, 10 and 10 to 65, 135, 25, 150 and 55, respectively. Therefore, sexually transmitted diseases, especially DRMs of HIV-1 in families, are of concern and draw attention to the need for enhanced drug-resistance prevention efforts, and accurate surveillance by more sensitive methods in complicated cases.;None;6.6;2.8;2.4;;;;

Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.This study sought to determine the dominant circulating human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype and associated drug resistance mutations in Ghana.This cross-sectional study was conducted with archived samples collected from patients who received care at 2 hospitals in Ghana from 2014 to 2016. Blood samples were earlier processed into plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and stored at -80 °C. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from the archived plasma. Two HIV-1 genes; protease and reverse transcriptase, were amplified, sequenced using gene-specific primers and analyzed for subtype and drug resistance mutations using the Stanford HIV Database.Of 16 patient samples successfully sequenced, we identified the predominance of HIV-1 subtype CRF02-AG (11/16, 68%). Subtypes G (2/16, 13%), dual CRF02-AG/G (2/16, 13%), and CRF01-AE (1/16, 6%) were also observed. Major nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance mutations, M184I/V, D67N, T215F, and K70R/E were found. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance mutations, K103N, Y181C, V90I, F227L, and V106A were also prevalent. Additionally, and at a lower level, protease inhibitor (PI)-resistance mutations, M46I, I54 V, V82A, L90 M, and I471 V, were also present in the sequences from antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced individuals. Two NRTI-associated drug resistance mutations (DRMs) (D67N and T69N) were present in sequences from 1 ART-naive individual.HIV-1 subtype CRF02-AG was most frequently detected in this study thus confirming earlier reports of dominance of this subtype in the West-African sub-region and Ghana in particular.

We aimed to evaluate whether individual in utero antiretroviral exposures were associated with increased risk of microcephaly based on long-term follow-up of infants and children who are HIV-exposed but uninfected. Methods: We evaluated children aged younger than 18 years who were HIV-exposed but uninfected with at least one head circumference measurement while enrolled in the Surveillance Monitoring for ART Toxicities (SMARTT) study at 22 clinical sites in the USA, including Puerto Rico. This prospective cohort study was done by the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study network. Microcephaly was defined as having a head circumference Z score <–2 according to the 2000 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts for children 6–36 months old and according to Nellhaus standards (head circumference <2nd percentile) after 36 months (SMARTT criteria); an alternate definition for microcephaly was based on applying Nellhaus standards across all ages (Nellhaus criteria). Modified Poisson regression models were fit to obtain relative risks (RRs) for associations between in utero antiretroviral exposure and microcephaly status, adjusted for potential confounders. Neurodevelopmental functioning was compared in children who are HIV-exposed but uninfected with or without microcephaly. Findings: Between March 21, 2007, and Aug 1, 2017, 3055 participants enrolled in SMARTT had at least one head circumference measurement. The cumulative incidence of microcephaly over a median of 5·1 years of follow-up (IQR 3·0–7·2) was 159 (5·2%, 95% CI 4·4–6·1) by Nellhaus criteria and 70 (2·3%, 1·8–2·9) by SMARTT criteria. In adjusted models, in utero exposure to efavirenz (4·7% exposed) was associated with increased risk of microcephaly by both Nellhaus standards (adjusted RR 2·02, 95% CI 1·16–3·51) and SMARTT criteria (2·56, 1·22–5·37). These associations were more pronounced in children exposed to combination regimens of efavirenz that included zidovudine plus lamivudine than those including tenofovir plus emtricitabine. Protective associations were observed for darunavir exposure (adjusted RR 0·50, 95% CI 0·24–1·00). Children who are HIV-exposed but uninfected with microcephaly had lower mean scores on neurodevelopmental assessments at age 1 and 5 years and a higher prevalence of neurodevelopmental impairment than those without microcephaly. Interpretation: These findings support consideration of alternatives to efavirenz as part of first-line antiretroviral therapy for pregnant women.

In GEMINI trials in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve HIV-1-infected adults, treatment with dolutegravir plus lamivudine provided rapid and sustained virological suppression and was noninferior to dolutegravir plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine at 48 weeks, irrespective of baseline patient or disease characteristics. Virological suppression was sustained at 96 weeks in these ongoing trials. In patients with HIV-1 with sustained virological suppression on their current tenofovir alafenamide (AF)-based ART regimen ( 3 drugs), switching to treatment with dolutegravir/lamivudine was noninferior to continuing on a tenofovir AF-based regimen at 48 weeks in the ongoing TANGO trial. No resistance mutations to dolutegravir or lamivudine were detected in patients who met criteria for confirmed virological withdrawal in GEMINI and TANGO trials. Hence, the dolutegravir/lamivudine STR is an effective, generally well tolerated and convenient initial and subsequent ART option for adolescents and adults with HIV-1 infection with no known or suspected resistance to the INSTI class or lamivudine.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40265-019-01247-1;9.4;9.2;9.6;00126667;;;

Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdProblem: Pregnancy appears to favor maternal antibody production. In contrast, by damaging follicular helper T cells (TFH), HIV-1 infection compromises protective humoural immune response. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the frequency of different TFH-like cells in HIV-infected pregnant women (PW) before and after antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. Method of study: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, CD4+ T and B cells, were obtained from asymptomatic HIV-1–infected non-PW and PW just before and after ARV therapy. In some experiments, healthy HIV-1–negative PW were also tested. The frequency of different TFH-like cell subsets was determined by flow cytometry. The plasma titers of IgG anti-tetanus toxoid (TT), anti-HBsAg, and anti-gp41 were determined by ELISA. The in vitro production of total IgG, IL-21, and hormones (estrogen and progesterone) was quantified also by ELISA. Results: Our results demonstrate that antiretroviral (ARV) therapy was more efficient in elevating the percentage of circulating IL-21–secreting TFH cells in HIV-1–infected pregnant women (PW) than in non-pregnant patients (nPW). Moreover, in co-culture systems, CD4+ T cells from ART-treated PW were more efficient in assisting B cells to produce IgG production. The in vivo anti-HBsAg IgG titers after ARV therapy were also significantly higher in PW, and their levels were directly associated with both IL-21+TFH frequency and plasma concentration of estrogen. Conclusion: In summary, our results suggest that pregnancy favors the recovery of TFH-like cells after ARV therapy in HIV-1–infected women, which could help these mothers to protect their newborns from infectious diseases by transferring IgG across the placenta.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/aji.13204;5.3;4.7;5.7;10467408;e13204;;

We aimed to establish whether an inexpensive point mutation assay can improve virological suppression by identifying PDR to guide drug selection for ART in a lower-middle income country. Methods: Investigators did an open-label, randomised controlled trial at three HIV treatment sites in Kenya: two in Nairobi and one in rural Maseno. Individuals (aged 2 years) were eligible to participate if they were confirmed HIV-seropositive, qualified for first-line ART, planned to reside in the area for more than 1 year, and provided informed consent. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to either PDR testing by oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA) to guide selection of ART or to standard of care, which did not include OLA testing. The OLA-guided therapy group had pre-ART peripheral blood mononuclear cells evaluated for drug resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) at codons Lys103Asn, Tyr181Cys, Gly190Ala, and to lamivudine at Met184Val, and when at least one drug-resistant codon was detected in a participant's pre-ART specimen, clinicians were directed to prescribe protease inhibitor-based second-line ART. Those without detected resistance and those who were randomised to standard of care received NNRTI-based first-line ART. The primary outcome was plasma HIV-1 RNA of at least 400 copies per mL at 4, 8, or 12 months after ART initiation, which defined virological failure, assessed in all participants who received treatment (data were censored for those lost-to-follow-up or who died). The study has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01898754. Findings: We screened 1198 participants between May 28, 2013, and Nov 4, 2014, of whom 991 (83%) were enrolled (492 received OLA and 495 received standard of care; four did not begin treatment). 93 participants (prevalence 9·4%) had PDR (95% CI 7·7–11·4). 34 (8·5%) of 400 participants in the OLA group had virological failure at month 12 of ART (95% CI 6·0–11·7) compared with 39 (9·7%) of 402 (7·0–13·0) in the standard-of-care group (log-rank p=0·26). Among participants with PDR, virological failure was lower in the OLA-guided therapy group than in the standard-of-care group: five (14%) of 35 compared with 13 (50%) of 26; p=0·0020). Among those prescribed NNRTI-based ART, participants given efavirenz were less likely to have virological failure than were those receiving nevirapine (odds ratio 0·37, 95% CI 0·22–0·62; p<0·0001). The OLA-guided therapy group had 39 serious non-lethal adverse events and 34 deaths. The standard-of-care group had 34 severe adverse events and 43 deaths, differences that were not significant. Adverse events judged to potentially be due to ART were few and similar between groups, with 17 (16%) in the OLA-guided therapy group and 16 (16%) in the standard-of-care group (p=0·90). Interpretation: Our finding that OLA testing for PDR reduced virological failure in only those with specific PDR mutations suggests that PDR poses less of a risk for virological failure than that predicted by past prevalence estimates, and that the value of PDR testing to reduce virological failure should be assessed for antiretroviral treatment regimens.

Mutations that arise as a result of this are diverse across the various drugs, drug classes, drug regimens and subtypes. In Uganda, there is a paucity of information on how these mutations differ among the different drug regimens and the predominant HIV-1 subtypes. The purpose of this study was to determine mutation profile differences between first-line drug regimens: TDF/3TC/EFV and AZT/3TC/EFV and HIV-1 subtypes: A and D in Uganda. The study also investigated the potential usage of rilpivirine, doravirine and etravirine in patients who failed treatment on efavirenz. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 182 archived plasma samples obtained from patients who were experiencing virological failure between 2006 and 2017 at five Joint Clinical Research Center (JCRC) sites in Uganda. Sanger sequencing of the Reverse Transcriptase (RT) gene from codons 1-300 was done. Mutation scores were generated using the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database. A Chi-square test was used to determine the association between drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and drug regimens or HIV-1 subtypes. Results: The prevalence of DRMs was 84.6% among patients failing a first-line efavirenz (EFV)-based regimen. The most prevalent Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI) mutations were M184V/I (67.3%), K219/Q/E (22.6%) and K65R (21.1%). While K103N (50.8%) and G190A/S/E/G (29.1%) were the most prevalent Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNTRI) mutations. As expected, discriminatory DRMs such as K65R, L74I, and Y115F were noted in Tenofovir (TDF) containing regimens while the Thymidine Analogue Mutations (TAMs) L210W and T215 mutations were in Zidovudine (AZT)-based regimens. No significant difference (p = 0.336) was found for overall DRMs between HIV-1 subtypes A and D. Among the patients who had resistance to EFV, 37 (23.6%) were susceptible to newer NNRTIs such as Rilpivirine and Etravirine. Conclusion: Accumulation of DRMs between AZT/3TC/EFV and TDF/3TC/EFV is comparable but individual mutations that confer resistance to particular drugs should be considered at virological failure. Having either HIV-1 subtype A or D is not associated with the acquisition of DRMs, therefore HIV diversity should not determine the choice of treatment. Rilpivirine, etravirine and doravirine had minimal benefits for patients who failed on efavirenz.;https://aidsrestherapy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12981-020-0258-7;3.2;3.8;4.4;;2;;

We characterized their drug resistance mutations (DRM) and adherence profiles to learn how to better manage HIV drug resistance. A retrospective cohort study utilizing clinical data and stored samples. Patients received ART at three Nigerian treatment centres. Plasma samples stored when they were in VF were genotyped. Result: Of 126 patients with samples available, 57 were successfully genotyped. From ART initiation, the proportion of patients with adherence 90% increased steadily from 54% at first high viral load (VL) to 67% at confirmed VF, and 81% at time of re-suppressed VL. Sixteen (28%) patients had at least one DRM. Forty-six (81%) patients had full susceptibility to the three drugs in their first-line (1 L) regimen. Thirteen (23%) were resistant to at least one antiretroviral drug but three were resistant to drugs not used in Nigeria. Ten patients had resistance to their 1 L drug(s) and six were fully susceptible to the three drugs in the recommended second-line regimen. Conclusion: This cohort had little drug resistance mutations. We conclude that if adherence is not assured, patients could exhibit virologic failure without having developed mutations associated with drug resistance.;https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-020-1706-1;5.1;5.4;5.0;;17;;

The product was also approved in the E.U. and Japan in November 2018 and January 2020, respectively. It is currently available as a single stand-alone tablet as well as part of a single-tablet regimen in a fixed-dose combination with tenofovir disoproxil and lamivudine. Similarly to other NNRTIs, doravirine exerts its antiviral effect through a noncompetitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. It has a novel resistance pathway so that it retains in vitro activity against clinically relevant NNRTI viral mutations K103N, Y181C and G190A. In randomized clinical trials, doravirine was noninferior to efavirenz- and darunavir-based regimens, with fewer adverse events. Doravirine has a more favorable drug interaction profile compared with earlier NNRTIs as it neither inhibits nor induces the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme. Doravirine has been added to the category of Recommended Initial Regimens in Certain Clinical Situations in the United States Department of Health and Human Services Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents.;http://journals.prous.com/journals/servlet/xmlxsl/pk_journals.xml_summary_pr?p_JournalId=4&p_RefId=3109966&p_IsPs=N;2.3;2.2;2.0;16993993;;;

All rights reserved.Background:Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived vesicles with diverse functions in intercellular communication including disease and infection, and EVs seem to influence HIV-1 pathogenesis. EVs isolated from HIV-1-uninfected semen (SE), but not blood (BE), contain factors that interfere with HIV-1 infection and replication in target cells. The reason for this dichotomy is unknown. Furthermore, the effect of HIV-1 infection and antiretroviral (ARV) drugs on the anti-HIV-1 effects of SE and BE is unknown. Here, we characterize EVs and EV-free plasma isolated from HIV-infected donor semen and blood and their effects on HIV infection.Methods:EVs and EV-free plasma were purified from autologous blood and semen of HIV-negative, HIV-infected antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve, and HIV-infected ART-treated participants. HIV infection was assessed in a TZM-bl cell reporter system. ARV concentrations were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.Results:SE isolated from both HIV-negative and HIV-infected, ART-naïve donors inhibited HIV-1 infection, but BE and semen and blood EV-free plasma did not. By contrast, BE, SE, and EV-free plasma from HIV-infected, ART-treated donors inhibited HIV-1. Importantly, exosomes isolated from ART-treated donors contained concentrations of ARV drugs (ART-EVs) at biologically relevant inhibitory levels.Conclusions:The HIV-1-inhibitory phenotype of SE is independent of donor HIV-1 or ART status, and ARV drugs and their metabolites are SE- and BE-associated in vivo.;http://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAI.0000000000002233;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;

With a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)-guided strategy, we assessed the effectiveness of half-a-tablet EFV plus 2 nucleos(t)ide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in HIV-infected Taiwanese who had achieved viral suppression with full-dose (600 mg) EFV. Methods: HIV-infected adults receiving EFV-containing regimens who had plasma mid-dose EFV concentration (C12) 2.0 mg/L and had plasma HIV RNA load (PVL) <200 copies/mL were enrolled in this single-arm, open-label study by reducing EFV to half-a-tablet daily. The primary endpoint was PVL <50 copies/ml in an intention-to-treat (ITT) population at week 48. The secondary endpoints were the plasma EFV C12, the proportion of patients with plasma EFV C12 <1.0 mg/L, PVL <50 copies/ml at week 96 and week 144. Results: Between April 2013 and September 2016, 203 patients (93.6% male; median age, 39.0 years) were enrolled. The median EFV C12 before switch was 2.80 mg/L (interquartile range (IQR), 2.41–3.73), which decreased to 1.59 mg/L (IQR, 1.23–2.03) after switch with a reduction of 47.4% (IQR, 38.3–55.5%). In ITT analysis, 93.6%, 92.3% and 87.3% of the patients achieved PVL <50 copies/ml at weeks 48, 96 and 144, respectively. More than 70% of the patients reported alleviation of EFV-associated adverse effects following the switch. Conclusion: Under the guidance of TDM, switch to half-a-tablet EFV plus 2 NRTIs is effective in maintaining viral suppression in HIV-infected Taiwanese with EFV C12  2.0 mg/L.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1684118218301245;3.9;4.3;4.8;16841182;;;

All Rights Reserved.Follicular helper T (TFH) cells have been shown to support productive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication and to serve as a key component of the latent viral reservoir. However, the viral characteristics of this latent reservoir and the clinical relevance of this reservoir remain unclear. In this study, we assessed the tropic composition of latent viruses from peripheral TFH (pTFH), non-TFH memory, and naive CD4 T cells from individuals with HIV-1 infections on suppressive combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). X4-tropic latent HIV-1 was preferentially enriched in pTFH cells compared to levels in the other two subsets. Interestingly, the ratio of X4-tropic latent HIV-1 in pTFH cells not only was robustly and inversely correlated with blood CD4 T cell counts across patients but also was prognostic of CD4 T cell recovery in individuals on long-term cART. Moreover, patients with higher X4-tropic latent HIV-1 ratios in pTFH cells showed greater risks of opportunistic coinfections. These findings reveal the characteristics of latent HIV-1 in TFH cells and suggest that the ratio of X4-tropic latent HIV-1 in pTFH cells is a valuable indicator for disease progression and cART efficacy. IMPORTANCE TFH cells have been shown to harbor a significant amount of latent HIV-1; however, the viral characteristics of this reservoir and its clinical relevance remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that X4-tropic latent HIV-1 is preferentially enriched in pTFH cells, which also accurately reflects the viral tropism shift. The ratio of X4-tropic proviruses in pTFH cells but not in other memory CD4 T cell subsets is inversely and closely correlated with blood CD4 T cell counts and CD4 T cell recovery rates with cART. Our data suggest that the ratio of X4-tropic provirus in peripheral TFH cells can be easily measured and reflects disease progression and treatment outcomes during cART.";https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/2/e01219-19;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;e01219-19;;

Fixed-dose combinations of antiretrovirals largely reduce pill burden. Areas covered: The authors first provide an overview of the use of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) based therapy in HIV care. They then summarize the properties of each drug in the fixed-dose combination of tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine/rilpivirine/(TAF/FTC/RPV). The efficacy and safety of each component and the combination as a whole are reviewed: FTC is non-inferior to lamivudine (3TC) at assessed dosages; TAF was non-inferior to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF); the viral efficacy of RPV is non-inferior with EFV at the assessed dosage; TAF/FTC/RPV is non-inferior in efficacy but shows less of a decline in bone mineral density and renal function compared to TDF/FTC/RPV. Finally, adverse effects and drug–drug interaction data with FTC/RPV/TAF are discussed. Expert opinion: TAF/FTC/RPV can be used as an initial regimen for people living with HIV whose HIV RNA <100,000 copies/ml and CD4 cell count > 200 cells/mm3 when INSTI-based regimens are not a treatment option. Future antiretroviral therapy development may focus on dual therapy-based regimens containing RPV, particularly as long-acting formulations.";https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14656566.2020.1713096;5.7;5.6;4.9;14656566;;;

In this study, we aimed to analyze the natural polymorphisms and acquired DRM profile in HIV-1 CRF01_AE-infected patients in a large first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) cohort in northeastern China. Methods: The natural polymorphisms of CRF01_AE were analyzed in 2034 patients from a long-term ART cohort in northeastern China. The polymorphisms in 105 treatment failure (TF) patients were compared with those in 1148 treatment success (TS) patients. The acquired DRM profile of 42 patients who experienced TF with tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz (TDF/3TC/EFV) treatment was analyzed by comparing the mutations at TF time point to those at baseline. The Stanford HIVdb algorithm was used to interpret the DRMs. Binomial distribution, McNemar test, Wilcoxon test and CorMut package were used to analyze the mutation rates and co-variation. Deep sequencing was used to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of co-variation. Results: Before ART, there were significantly more natural polymorphisms of 31 sites on reverse transcriptase (RT) in CRF01_AE than subtype B HIV-1 (|Z value|  3), including five known drug resistance-associated sites (238, 118, 179, 103, and 40). However, only the polymorphism at site 75 was associated with TF (|Z value|  3). The mutation rate at 14 sites increased significantly at TF time point compared to baseline, with the most common DRMs comprising G190S/C, K65R, K101E/N/Q, M184 V/I, and V179D/I/A/T/E, ranging from 66.7 to 45.2%. Moreover, two unknown mutations (V75 L and L228R) increased by 19.0 and 11.9% respectively, and they were under positive selection (Ka/Ks > 1, log odds ratio [LOD] > 2) and were associated with several other DRMs (cKa/Ks > 1, LOD > 2). Deep sequencing of longitudinal plasma samples showed that L228R occurred simultaneously or followed the appearance of Y181C. Conclusion: The high levels of natural polymorphisms in CRF01_AE had little impact on treatment outcomes. The findings regarding potential new CRF01_AE-specific minor DRMs indicate the need for more studies on the drug resistance phenotype of CRF01_AE.;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-4808-3;4.5;4.3;4.1;;178;;

However, whether LLV increases the risk of virologic failure (VF) is controversial because of the non-uniform definitions of LLV and VF. Methods: A long-term first line regimen ART cohort from 2002 to 2018 from Shenyang, northeast China, was retrospectively studied. All participants were followed up every 3 to 6 months to evaluate the treatment effect. The high-risk LLV subgroups leading to VF (with strict standards) were explored with Cox proportional hazards model and linear mixed-effect model. The association factors of high-risk LLV were further explored using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results: A total of 2155 HIV-1 infected participants were included; of these, 38.7% showed LLV. Both high level LLV (HLLV) and any other level LLV coupled with high level blip (HLB) showed higher risk of VF (hazards ratios, HRHLLV = 5.93, and HRHLB = 2.84, p < 0.05 respectively). Moreover, HR increased with prolonged duration of LLV. Independent factors associated with high-risk LLV included the zenith baseline viral load (VL) above 6 log copies/ml (aOR = 3.49, p = 0.002), nadir baseline CD4 + T cell counts below 200 cells/mm3 (aOR = 1.78, p = 0.011), Manchu (aOR = 2.03, p = 0.003), ART over 60 months (aOR = 1.81, p = 0.004), AZT + 3TC + NVP (aOR = 2.26, p < 0.001) or DDI-based regimen (aOR = 9.96, p = 0.002), and subtype B infection (aOR = 8.22, p = 0.001). Conclusions: In case of VF with strict standards, high-risk LLV leading to VF includes VL above 400 copies/ml, occurring at least once. Serious laboratory indicators or advanced stage of infection, long term ART and subtype B infection might also predict the occurrence of high-risk LLV.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-4837-y;4.5;4.3;4.1;;147;;

We aimed to explore the temporal association of S68G and K65R mutations and disclose the role of the former on susceptibility to nucleotide/nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and viral replication with the K65R double mutations among CRF01_AE-infected patients who failed treatment. Methods: The occurrence of S68G and K65R mutations was evaluated among HIV-1 of various subtypes in the global HIV Drug Resistance Database. The temporal association of S68G and K65R mutations was analyzed through next-generation sequencing in four CRF01_AE-infected patients who failed treatment with tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz. The impact of the S68G mutation on susceptibility to NRTI and replication fitness was analyzed using pseudovirus phenotypic resistance assays and growth competition assays, respectively. Results: The frequency of the S68G mutation increased by 1.4-9.7% in almost all HIV subtypes and circulating recombinant forms in treatment-experienced patients, except subtype F. The S68G mutation often occurred in conjunction with the K65R mutation among RTI-treated patients, with frequencies ranging 21.1-61.7% in various subtypes. Next-generation sequencing revealed that the S68G mutation occurred following the K65R mutation in three of the four CRF01_AE-infected patients. In these three patients, there was no significant change detected in the half maximal inhibitory concentration for zidovudine, tenofovir, or lamivudine between the K65R and K65R/S68G mutations, as demonstrated by the phenotypic resistance assays. Virus stocks of the K65R and K65R/S68G mutations were mixed with 4:6, 1:1, and 9:1 and cultured for 13 days, the K65R/S68G mutants outgrew those of the K65R mutants irrespective of the input ratio. Conclusions: S68G may be a natural polymorphism and compensatory mutation of K65R selected by NRTIs in the CRF01_AE strain of HIV-1. This mutation does not affect susceptibility to NRTI; however, it improves the replication fitness of K65R mutants. This study deciphers the role of the S68G mutation in the HIV reverse transcriptase of the CRF01_AE strain and provides new evidence for the interpretation of drug-resistant mutations in non-B subtypes of HIV-1.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-4836-z;4.5;4.3;4.1;;123;;

The efficacy and safety of dolutegravir (DTG) were assessed in adults with HIV and drug-susceptible tuberculosis. Methods: International Study of Patients with HIV on Rifampicin ING is a noncomparative, active-control, randomized, open-label study in HIV-1-infected antiretroviral therapy-naive adults (CD4+ 50 cells/mm3). Participants on rifampicin-based tuberculosis treatment 8 weeks were randomized (3:2) to receive DTG (50 mg twice daily both during and 2 weeks after tuberculosis therapy, then 50 mg once daily) or efavirenz (EFV; 600 mg daily) with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of DTG-arm participants with plasma HIV-1-RNA <50 copies/mL (responders) by the Food and Drug Administration Snapshot algorithm (intent-to-treat exposed population) at Week 48. The study was not powered to compare arms. Results: For DTG (n = 69), the baseline HIV-1 RNA was >100 000 copies/mL in 64% of participants, with a median CD4+ count of 208 cells/mm3; for EFV (n = 44), 55% of participants had HIV-1 RNA >100 000 copies/mL, with a median CD4+ count of 202 cells/mm3. The Week 48 response rates were 75% (52/69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 65-86%) for DTG and 82% (36/44, 95% CI 70-93%) for EFV. The DTG nonresponses were driven by non-treatment related discontinuations (n = 10 lost to follow-up). There were no deaths or study drug switches. There were 2 discontinuations for toxicity (EFV). There were 3 protocol-defined virological failures (2 DTG, no acquired resistance; 1 EFV, emergent resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors). The tuberculosis treatment success rate was high. Tuberculosis-associated IRIS was uncommon (4/arm), with no discontinuations for IRIS. Conclusions: Among adults with HIV receiving rifampicin-based tuberculosis treatment, twice-daily DTG was effective and well tolerated.

Methods: Participants in the ANRS IPERGAY trial were randomly assigned to receive PrEP (fixed-dose combination of 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and 200 mg emtricitabine per pill) or placebo. The primary endpoint was the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection. Pill uptake was assessed by counting returned pills at each follow-up and by estimating tenofovir concentration from frozen plasma samples. Participants were interviewed at each visit to assess the pattern of PrEP use. All participants enrolled in the modified intention-to-treat population of the double-blind phase of the ANRS IPERGAY trial were eligible for this post-hoc analysis. We calculated the total follow-up time for periods of less frequent sexual intercourse with high PrEP adherence (15 pills or fewer per month taken systematically or often during sexual intercourse). To estimate the time of HIV acquisition, fourth-generation HIV-1/2 ELISA assays, plasma HIV-1 RNA assays, and western blot analyses were done with use of frozen samples, and the stage of HIV infection was defined according to Fiebig staging. HIV incidence was compared between the two treatment groups among individuals who had less frequent sexual intercourse with high PrEP adherence. The ANRS IPERGAY trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01473472. Findings: 400 participants who were randomly assigned to receive PrEP (n=199) or placebo (n=201) between Feb 22, 2012, and Oct 17, 2014, were included in this analysis. 270 participants had at least one period of less frequent sexual intercourse with high PrEP adherence during the study, representing 134 person-years of follow-up and 31% of the total study follow-up. During these periods, participants in both groups reported a median of 5·0 (IQR 2·0–10·0) episodes of sexual intercourse per month and used a median of 9·5 (6·0–13·0) pills per month. Six HIV-1 infections were diagnosed in the placebo group (HIV incidence of 9·2 per 100 person-years; 95% CI 3·4–20·1) and none were diagnosed in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine arm (HIV incidence of 0 per 100 person-years; 0–5·4; p=0·013), with a relative reduction of HIV incidence of 100% (95% CI 39–100). Interpretation: A choice between daily or on-demand PrEP regimens could be offered to men who have sex with men who have less frequent sexual intercourse.

Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a novel tenofovir prodrug with a 90% reduction in plasma tenofovir concentrations. We aimed to assess the non-inferiority of a TAF-containing combination regimen versus a TDF-containing fixed-dose single-tablet regimen in the antiretroviral-treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected patients. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Trial Registry, from January 2001 to July 2019, using relevant keywords. Available data were extracted from eligible randomized trials (RCTs) and pooled as risk ratios (RRs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) in a meta-analysis model using Stata/SE. Results: We included seven eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 6269 participants. Patients who were antiretroviral-naive adults with HIV-1 on both the TAF-containing regimens and the TDF-containing regimens had similar virologic suppression effects (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00–1.04; p > 0.05) at week 24 (93.99% vs. 94.20%), week 48 (90.71% vs. 89.54%), and week 96 (86.16% vs. 84.80%). Both groups had no significant improvements in CD4 cell count for the naive patients during 48 weeks of therapy (SMD, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.16; p < 0.05). Both treatments were safe and well-tolerated, and most adverse events were similar as mild to moderate in severity. Moreover, compared with the TDF-containing regimens, the TAF-containing regimens in patients had significantly smaller reductions in both hip (RR, 0.33; 95CI, 0.29-0.39; p < 0.05) and spine (RR, 0.58; 95CI, 0.51–0.65; p < 0.05). Additionally, the TAF-containing regimens in patients had significantly fewer increases for renal events than those of the TDF-containing regimens through 48 weeks (0.31; 95% CI, 0.18–0.55; p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis indicated that efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TAF-containing regimens were non-inferior in fixed-dose single-tablet regimens for initial treatment of HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, compared with those receiving the TDF-containing regimens, patients on the TAF-containing regimens had significant advantages in renal function, bone parameters, and lipid profile for the naive patients.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1201971220300370;5.3;5.6;5.3;12019712;;;

However, the clinical potential of cell-associated (CA) HIV-1 molecular markers is much less understood. Here, we measured CA HIV-1 RNA and DNA in HIV-infected individuals treated with temporary ART initiated during primary HIV-1 infection. We demonstrate substantial predictive value of CA RNA for (a) the virological and immunological response to early ART, (b) the magnitude and time to viral rebound after discontinuation of early ART, and (c) disease progression in the absence of treatment. Remarkably, when adjusted for CA RNA, plasma VL no longer appeared as an independent predictor of any clinical endpoint in this cohort. The potential of CA RNA as an HIV-1 clinical marker, in particular as a predictive biomarker of virological control after stopping ART, should be explored in the context of HIV-1 curative interventions.;https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/134196;0;2.6;5.8;;e134196;;

However, in some remote settings, access to viral load monitoring is still complex due to logistical and financial constraints. Use of dried blood spots (DBS) for blood collection could overcome these difficulties. This study aims to describe feasibility and operability of DBS use for routine viral load monitoring. Methods From June 2017 to April 2018, HIV-infected adults who initiated ART were enrolled in a prospective cohort in 43 clinical sites across 6 provinces in North Vietnam. Following national guidelines, the first viral load monitoring was planned 6 months after ART initiation. DBS were collected at the clinical site and sent by post to a central laboratory in Hanoi for viral load measurement. Results Of the 578 patients enrolled, 537 were still followed 6 months after ART initiation, of which DBS was collected for 397 (73.9%). The median (inter quartile range) delay between DBS collection at site level and reception at the central laboratory was 8 (6-19) days and for 70.0% viral load was measured 30 days after blood collection. The proportion of patients with viral load 1000 copies/mL at the 6 month evaluation was 15.9% (n = 59). Of these, a DBS was collected again to confirm virological failure in 15 (24.4%) of which virological failure was confirmed in 11 (73.3%). Conclusion Delay of DBS transfer to the central laboratory was acceptable and most viral loads were measured in 30 days, in-line with routine follow-up. However, the level of DBS coverage and the proportion of patients in failure for whom a confirmatory viral load was available were suboptimal, indicating that integration of viral load monitoring in the field requires, among other things, careful training and strong involvement of the local teams. The proportion of patients experiencing virological failure was in line with other reports; interestingly those who reported being non-adherent and those with a low BMI were more at risk of failure.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230968;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0230968;;

Methods: This prespecified analysis pooled efficacy data through the first 48 weeks of DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD from the DOR groups (DOR/lamivudine [3TC]/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF] or DOR [100 mg daily] with emtricitabine [FTC]/TDF or abacavir [ABC]/3TC [n = 747]) compared with DRV+r (800/100 mg daily) with FTC/TDF or ABC/3TC (n = 383) or EFV/FTC/TDF (600/200/300 mg daily; n = 364). Efficacy assessments included the proportion of participants with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA <50 copies/mL and change in CD4+ T-cell count. Results: At week 48, DOR demonstrated noninferior efficacy to DRV+r and EFV, with 84.1% of DOR-treated participants achieving HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL compared with 79.9% of the DRV+r and 80.8% of the EFV groups. Results were similar across demographic/prognostic subpopulations, including baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA, gender, race, and HIV-1 subtype. Mean increases from baseline in CD4+ T-cell count through 48 weeks were 195.5 cells/mm3 for DOR, 185.6 cells/mm3 for DRV+r, and 188.4 cells/mm3 for EFV/FTC/TDF. Conclusions: DOR, as a single entity (in combination with other antiretroviral agents) and as a fixed-dose combination (DOR/3TC/TDF), demonstrated noninferior efficacy to DRV+r and EFV as assessed by the proportion of HIV-1-infected, treatment-naive adults with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL.

We aimed to determine if responses to standardized combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) were similar between groups despite strain divergence. Methods: We performed an open nonrandomized study comparing the immunological, virological, and clinical responses to cART based on 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus 1 ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor, in naive and paired HIV-1/O vs HIV-1/M infected (+) patients (ratio 1:2), matched on several criteria. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with undetectable plasma viral load (pVL, threshold 60 copies/mL) at week (W) 48. Secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with undetectable pVL at W24 and W96 and CD4 evolution between baseline and W24, W48, and W96. Results: Forty-seven HIV-1/O+ and 94 HIV-1/M+ patients were included. Mean pVL at baseline was significantly lower by 1 log for HIV-1/O+ vs HIV-1/M+ patients. At W48, no significant difference was observed between populations with undetectable pVL and differences at W24 and W96 were not significant. A difference in CD4 gain was observed in favor of HIV-1/M at W48 and W96, but this was not significant when adjusted on both matched criteria and pVL at baseline. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate similar immunovirological and clinical response between HIV-1/O+ and HIV-1/M+ patients. They also reveal significantly lower baseline replication for HIV-1/O variants, suggesting specific virological properties and physiopathology that now need to be addressed.

Objectives: The main objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of acquired drug resistance (ADR) the epidemic characteristics of HIV-1-resistant strains among ART-failed HIV patients in Hunan Province, China. Methods: ART-experienced and virus suppression failure subjects in Hunan between 2012 and 2017 were evaluated by genotyping analysis and mutations were scored using the HIVdb.stanford.edu algorithm to infer drug susceptibility. Results: The prevalence of HIV-1 ADR were 2.76, 2.30, 2.98, 2.62, 2.23and 2.17%, respectively, from 2012 to 2017. Overall 2295 sequences were completed from 2932 ART-failure patients, and 914 of these sequences were found to have drug resistance mutation. The most common subtype was AE (64.14%), followed by BC (17.91%) and B (11.50%). Among those 914 patients with drug resistance mutations,93.11% had NNRTI-associated drug resistance mutations, 74.40% had NRTI drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and 6.89% had PI DRMs. Dual-class mutations were observed in 591 (64.66%) cases, and triple-class mutations were observed in 43 (4.70%) cases. M184V (62.04%), K103N (41.90%) and I54L (3.83%) were the most common observed mutations, respectively, in NRTI-, NNRTI-A nd PI-associated drug resistance. 93.76% subjects who had DRMs received the ART first-line regimens. CD4 count, symptoms in the past 3 months, and ART adherence were found to be associated with HIV-1 DR. Conclusions: This study showed that although the prevalence of HIV-acquired resistance in Hunan Province is at a low-level, the long-term and continuous surveillance of HIV ADR in antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) patients is necessary.;https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12985-020-01311-3;4.0;4.2;4.5;;38;;

Methods: Logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with HIVDR. Variables associated with drug resistance in multivariable logistic regression were included in the Cochran-Armitage test for trend. Results: A total of 11,976 patients were enrolled in the study. The prevalence of HIVDR among patients who received ART for 9-24 months during 2003-2008, 2009-2012, and 2013-2015 significantly decreased (15.5%, 6.3%, and 2.3%, respectively, P < 0.01). With respect to the class of antiretroviral, there were substantial increases in resistance to both non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (2003-2008, 2009-2012, and 2013-2015: 49.7%, 58.9%, and 73.0%, respectively, P < 0.01). The prevalence of DR to protease inhibitors (PIs) was low, which supported their continued use as second-line therapy in China.

The aim of the present study was to compare the expression levels of specific miRNAs, as well as their correlation with markers of response to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, in patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection with and without resistance to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Methods: miRNA assays were performed on plasma samples obtained from 20 HIV-1-positive patients. A total of ten patients were divided into two groups: HAART-responsive and HAART-resistant (n=5 per group). Commercial arrays were subsequently used to identify 84 miRNAs. A total of three differentially expressed miRNAs were selected and analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Five other patients were subsequently added to each group for a new relative expression analysis. The absolute expression level of the two miRNAs was obtained and compared using the Student’s t test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify patients with antiretroviral therapy (ART) resistance. Results: The array analysis revealed that miR-15b-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-126-3p and miR-150-5p were down-regulated in patients with HAART-resistance comparing with HAART-responsive. The expression levels of miR-16-5p, miR-26a-5p and miR-150-5p were confirmed using qPCR. The area under the ROC curve was 1.0 for the three miRNAs. Conclusions: The lower expression levels of miR-16-5p and miR-26a-5p in patients with HAART-resistance suggested that these may serve as potential biomarkers for the identification of HAART-responsive patients.;https://portlandpress.com/bioscirep/article/doi/10.1042/BSR20194433/222736/Plasma-microRNA-expression-levels-in-HIV1positive;3.1;2.9;2.9;01448463;BSR20194433;;

All Rights Reserved.The major obstacle to a cure for HIV infection is the persistence of replication-competent viral reservoirs during antiretroviral therapy. HIV-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have been developed to target latently infected CD4- T cells that express virus either spontaneously or after intentional latency reversal. Whether HIV-specific CAR-T cells can recognize and eliminate the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) reservoir of HIV-bound immune complexes (ICs) is unknown. We created HIV-specific CAR-T cells using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and a CAR construct that enables the expression of CD4 (domains 1 and 2) and the carbohydrate recognition domain of mannose binding lectin (MBL) to target native HIV Env (CD4-MBL CAR). We assessed CAR-T cell cytotoxicity using a carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) release assay and evaluated CAR-T cell activation through interferon gamma (IFN-) production and CD107a membrane accumulation by flow cytometry. CD4-MBL CAR-T cells displayed potent lytic and functional responses to Env-expressing cell lines and HIV-infected CD4  T cells but were ineffective at targeting FDC bearing HIV-ICs. CD4-MBL CAR-T cells were unresponsive to cell-free HIV or concentrated, immobilized HIV-ICs in cell-free experiments. Blocking intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) inhibited the cytolytic response of CD4-MBL CAR-T cells to Env-expressing cell lines and HIV-infected CD4  T cells, suggesting that factors such as adhesion molecules are necessary for the stabilization of the CAR-Env interaction to elicit a cytotoxic response. Thus, CD4-MBL CAR-T cells are unable to eliminate the FDC-Associated HIV reservoir, and alternative strategies to eradicate this reservoir must be sought.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/10/e00190-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;e00190-20;;

The plasma samples were collected from antiretroviral therapy (ART)-failure experienced individuals from 2016 to 2017 in Yunnan Province, China. The genotyping drug resistance of HIV-1 pol gene fragments was implemented using in-house assay. According to the analysis of RIP and MEGA 7.0, the HIV-1 strains related to URFs were screened for recombinant identification and drug resistance analysis. A total of 130 pol sequences of HIV-1 URF strains were obtained from 1,121 samples. The proportion of HIV-1 URF strains was 11.6% among the ART-failure individuals from 2016 to 2017 in Yunnan. The overall drug-resistance rate of HIV-1 URF strains was 56.9%. Meanwhile, the percentage of protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) resistance was 3.8% (5/130), 36.2% (47/130), and 53.8% (70/130), respectively. Mutations such as M184V/I (35.4%) in NRTIs and K103N/R/S/T (25.4%), V179D/E/T/Y (18.9%), G190A/E/R/S (13.8%), and Y181C (9.2%) in NNRTIs were common among the HIV-1 URF strains relative to other mutations. Factors such as male, sexual transmission pathway, and source of the year 2017 were significantly correlated with the development of HIV-1 URF drug resistance. The emergence of the multiple recombinant forms identified in Yunnan indicates active transmission networks of HIV-1 of different HIV-1 subtype/circulating recombinant forms cross-infection in this region. Therefore, it is necessary to further monitor the molecular epidemiology and drug resistance of HIV-1 in Yunnan.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2019.0041;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;

As such, studying HIV drug resistance allows for real-time evaluation of evolutionary mechanisms. Characterizing the biological process of drug resistance is also critically important for sustained effectiveness of ART. Investigating the link between “black box” deep learning methods applied to this problem and evolutionary principles governing drug resistance has been overlooked to date. Here, we utilized publicly available HIV-1 sequence data and drug resistance assay results for 18 ART drugs to evaluate the performance of three architectures (multilayer perceptron, bidirectional recurrent neural network, and convolutional neural network) for drug resistance prediction, jointly with biological analysis. We identified convolutional neural networks as the best performing architecture and displayed a correspondence between the importance of biologically relevant features in the classifier and overall performance. Our results suggest that the high classification performance of deep learning models is indeed dependent on drug resistance mutations (DRMs). These models heavily weighted several features that are not known DRM locations, indicating the utility of model interpretability to address causal relationships in viral genotype-phenotype data.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/5/560;5.8;5.3;4.3;;560;;

We sought to use central pharmacy supply data of Mozambique's rural Zambézia Province (2017 population 5.11 million persons; 12.6% adult HIV prevalence in 2016) to examine shortages, stockouts, and trends in availability. Using stock surveillance for 60 weeks in 2014-2015, we assessed availability of 36 medications [4 classes: adult antiretroviral (ARV) medications, pediatric ARVs, anti-TB medications, and antibiotics] and diagnostic test kits (2 rapid tests for HIV; 1 each for malaria and syphilis). We contrasted these to 2018-2019 data. We modeled pharmacy data using ordinal logistic regression, characterizing weekly product availability in four categories: good, adequate, shortage, or complete stockout. We found 166 (7.7%) stockouts and 150 (6.9%) shortages among 2,160 weekly records. Earlier calendar time was associated with reduced medication supplies (p < .001). Certain medication/test kit classes were associated with reduced supply (p < .001). We found an interaction between time and medication class on the odds of reduced supply (p < .001). Pediatric ARVs had a 17.4 (95% confidence interval: 8.8-34.4) times higher odds of reduced medication supply compared with adult ARVs at study midpoint. Trends comparing the first and last weeks showed adult ARVs having 67% and pediatric having 71% lower odds of reduced supplies. Only adult ARV shortages improved amid growing demand. Data from 2018 to 2019 suggest continuing inventory management challenges. Monitoring of drug (especially pediatric) and test kit shortages is vital to ensure quality improvement to guarantee adequate supplies to enable patients and care providers to achieve sustained viral suppression.

Methods: Open-label, single-arm, 48-week pilot trial. HIV-1 infected adults, naïve to integrase inhibitors, with CD4+ above 350 cell/L and fewer than 50 HIV-1 RNA copies per mL the year prior to study entry switched to dolutegravir plus lamivudine. Participants were excluded if baseline proviral DNA population genotyping detected lamivudine resistance-associated mutations. To detect resistance minority variants, proviral DNA next-generation sequencing was retrospectively performed from baseline samples. Primary efficacy endpoint was proportion of participants with fewer than 50 HIV-1 RNA copies per mL at week 48. Safety and tolerability outcomes were incidence of adverse events and treatment discontinuations. ART-PRO is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03539224. Findings: 41 participants switched to dolutegravir plus lamivudine, 21 with lamivudine resistance mutations in historical plasma genotypes. Baseline next-generation sequencing detected lamivudine resistance mutations (M184V/I and/or K65R/E/N) over a 5% threshold in 15/21 (71·4%) and 3/20 (15%) of participants with and without history of lamivudine resistance, respectively. At week 48, 92·7% of participants (38/41) had fewer than 50 HIV-1 RNA copies per mL. There were no cases of virologic failure. Three participants with historical lamivudine resistance were prematurely discontinued from the study (2 protocol violations, one adverse event). Ten participants (4 in the group with historical lamivudine resistance) had a transient viral rebound, all resuppressed on dolutegravir plus lamivudine. There were 28 drug-related adverse events, only one leading to discontinuation. Interpretation: In this pilot trial, dolutegravir plus lamivudine was effective in maintaining virologic control despite past historical lamivudine resistance and presence of archived lamivudine resistance-associated mutations detected by next generation sequencing. Further studies are needed to confirm our results.

To assess the effect of doubling the rifampicin dose (to 20 mg/kg/day, R20) on efavirenz pharmacokinetics (PK) in HIV/TB coinfected patients. Methods: Open-label Phase 2 drug-drug interaction randomized trial. Pulmonary TB, ART-naive adults were randomized to R20 and either efavirenz 600 mg (EFV600) or 800 mg (EFV800), or rifampicin 10 mg/kg/day (R10) and EFV600 with a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients were first started on TB treatment and 2-4 weeks later started on ART. They were switched to R10 and EFV600 after 8 weeks. Full PK sampling was done 4 weeks (on rifampicin) and 24 weeks (off rifampicin) after ART initiation. Transaminases, plasma HIV-1 RNA and sputum cultures were monitored. The efavirenz geometric mean ratio (GMR) of AUC at 4 and 24 weeks after ART initiation within the same patient was calculated in each arm and its 90% CI was compared with a preset range (0.70-1.43). Results: Of 98 enrolled patients (32 in the R20EFV600 arm, 33 in the R20EFV800 arm and 33 in the R10EFV600 arm), 87 had full PK sampling. For the R20EFV600, R20EFV800 and R10EFV600 arms, GMRs of efavirenz AUC were 0.87 (90% CI: 0.75-1.00), 1.12 (90% CI: 0.96-1.30) and 0.96 (90% CI: 0.84-1.10). Twelve weeks after ART initiation, 78.6%, 77.4% and 72.4% of patients had HIV-1 RNA below 100 copies/mL and 85.7%, 86.7% and 80.0% had Week 8 culture conversion, respectively. Two patients per arm experienced a severe increase in transaminases. Conclusions: Doubling the rifampicin dose had a small effect on efavirenz concentrations and was well tolerated.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/5/1250/5718045;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

Tropical Medicine & International Health Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdObjective: Early identification of confirmed virological failure is paramount to avoid accumulation of drug resistance in patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Scale-up of HIV-RNA monitoring in Africa and timely switch to second-line regimens are challenged. Methods: A WHO adapted confirmed virological treatment screening algorithm (HIV-RNA screening, enhanced adherence counselling, confirmatory HIV-RNA testing) was evaluated in HIV-infected patients on first-line ART from Tanzania. The main endpoints included viral resuppression and virological failure rates, retention and turnaround time of the screening algorithm until second-line ART initiation. Secondary endpoints included risk factors for virological treatment failure and patterns of genotypic drug resistance. Results: HIV-RNA >1000 copies/ml at first screening was detected in 58/356 (16.3%) patients (median time-on-treatment 6.3 years, 25% immunological treatment failure). Adjusted risk factors for virological failure were age <30 years (RR 5.2 [95% CI: 2.5–10.8]), years on ART 3 years (RR 3.0 [1.0–8.9]), CD4-counts <200 cells/µl (RR 9.3 [4.0–21.8]) and poor self-reported treatment adherence (RR 2.0 [1.2–3.4]). Resuppression of HIV-RNA <1000 copies/ml was observed in 5/50 (10%) cases after enhanced adherence counselling. Confirmatory testing within 3 months was performed in only 46.6% and switch to second-line ART within 6 months in 60.4% of patients. Major NNRTI-mutation were detected in all of 30 patients, NRTI mutations in 96.7% and 3 thymidine-analogue mutations in 40%. No remaining NRTI options were predicted in 57% and limited susceptibility in 23% of patients. Conclusion: We observed low levels of viral resuppression following adherence counselling, associated with high levels of accumulated drug resistance. High visit burden and turnaround times for confirmed virological failure diagnosis further delayed switching to second-line treatment which could be improved using novel point-of-care viral load monitoring systems.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tmi.13373;5.3;4.7;4.5;13602276;;;

Regimens include two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus either an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), a non-NRTI (NNRTI) or a boosted protease inhibitor (PI). The objective was to examine the outcomes of recommended first-line ART in Germany. Methods: This nationwide observational study included treatment-naïve chronically HIV-1 infected patients receiving one of the recommended first-line regimens. Patients were allocated to three arms (INSTI, NNRTI, PI) and were prospectively followed for 24 months. Delayed treatment initiation was defined by a baseline CD4 T-cell count of < 350/µl or CDC clinical stage C. Results: Among a total of 434 patients enrolled, virologic failure was rare and occurred in 4.3% (6/141) in the PI arm, in 3.3% (4/122) in the NNRTI arm and in 0.6% (1/171) in the INSTI arm (p = 0.10). De novo drug resistance mutations developed in only two patients in the NNRTI arm. Nonetheless, treatment modifications were frequent (51%) and mostly performed for strategic reasons. Retention on all initial compounds at month 24 was 64%, 49%, and 22% in the INSTI, NNRTI and PI arms respectively. Delayed treatment initiation was common (47%) and more frequently observed in patients in the PI arm. It was not associated with virological failure. Conclusion: High efficacy and low virological failure rates were observed with recommended first-line regimens independent of delayed treatment initiation, chosen regimen and subsequent treatment modifications, demonstrating the validity of the current treatment guidelines.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s15010-020-01428-1;4.6;4.2;4.9;03008126;;;

Here we explore phenotypic drug resistance in such patients in order to better understand this phenomenon. Patients (n = 71) failing a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen, but who subsequently re-suppressed on the same regimen, were assessed for HIV-1 genotypic drug resistance through Sanger sequencing. A subset (n = 23) of these samples, as well as genotypically matched samples from patients who did not re-suppress (n = 19), were further assessed for phenotypic drug resistance in an in vitro single cycle assay. Half of the patients (n = 36/71, 51%) harboured genotypic drug resistance, with M184V (n = 18/36, 50%) and K103N (n = 16/36, 44%) being the most prevalent mutations. No significant difference in the median time to re-suppression (31-39 weeks) were observed for either group (p = 0.41). However, re-suppressors with mutant virus rebounded significantly earlier than those with wild-type virus (16 vs. 33 weeks; p = 0.014). Similar phenotypic drug resistance profiles were observed between patients who re-suppressed and patients who failed to re-suppress. While most remained susceptible to stavudine (d4T) and zidovudine (AZT), both groups showed a reduced susceptibility to 3TC and NNRTIs. HIV- 1 infected patients on an NNRTI-based regimen can achieve viral re-suppression on the same regimen despite harbouring viruses with genotypic and phenotypic drug resistance. However, re-suppression was less durable in those with resistance, reinforcing the importance of appropriate regimen choices, ongoing viral load monitoring and adherence counselling.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234937;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0234937;;

All rights reserved.Objective: To investigate the influence of ABCB1 polymorphisms on the plasma level of efavirenz in Thai adult cases infected with HIV-1. Methods: A single nucleotide polymorphism of ABCB1 3435C>T (rs1045642) in the gene encoding ABCB1 was genotyped using real-time PCR-based alleles in 149 HIV-infected Thai adults receiving efavirenz treatment. Plasma concentrations of efavirenz were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography 12 hr after administration. The relationship between plasma efavirenz concentrations and ABCB1 3435C>T polymorphisms was analyzed. Results: Logistic regression analysis showed no significant predictors of high plasma efavirenz concentration in relation to age, gender, body weight, CD4 count and plasma HIV-1 RNA, blood biochemical parameters, antiretroviral duration or ABCB1 3435C>T polymorphisms, except for height (OR=0.902, 95% CI: 0.835-0.973) (P<0.05). The minor allele frequency of ABCB1 3435C>T was 0.446. The frequency of the heterozygous mutant ABCB1 3435C/ T was 53.02% (n=79), ABCB1 3435T/T homozygous mutant was 18.12% (n=27) and the wild type ABCB1 3435C/C genotype was 28.86% (n=43). The overall median plasma concentration of efavirenz in 149 HIV-infected Thai cases was 2.41 mg/L [IQR: (1.46-4.12) mg/L]. The plasma concentration of efavirenz was higher in cases with ABCB1 3435T/T homozygous mutant [2.73 mg/L, IQR: (2.02-4.19) mg/L] and ABCB1 3435C/T heterozygous mutant [2.29 mg/L, IQR: (1.41-4.28) mg/L] genotypes compared to the wild type ABCB1 3435C/C homozygous [2.1 mg/L, IQR: (1.37-3.53) mg/L]. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the efavirenz concentration between the different genotypes (P>0.05). Conclusions: There is no statistical significance for a tendency toward higher plasma efavirenz concentration in the ABCB1 3435T/T and ABCB1 3435C/T genotypes. No parameters of physiological characteristics in this study except for height were found to be predictors of high plasma efavirenz concentration in Thai HIV-1 infected cases.;None;3.7;3.2;4.1;19957645;;;

The traditional Sanger sequencing method is capable of detecting drug resistant mutations (DRMs) that make up at least 10–15% of the viral quasispecies population. Newer next generation sequencing technologies have a greater sensitivity for the detection of minority variant DRMs down to around 1% of the population. Objectives: Here NGS sequencing on the Vela Diagnostics automated next generation sequencing platform was evaluated and compared to the currently used Sanger sequencing method. Study design: Sequences from both methods were obtained from a total of 79 patients, with a range of subtypes (CRF01_AE, A1/G, A1/CRF01_AE, A1/CRF02_AG, A1, A, B, C, CRF01_AG, CRF 06_CPX, D, G, B/G, CRF 57_BC/C, G/CRF 02_AG and CRF 14_BG/G) and viral loads (2.43–7 log10 copies/ml). Results: A high concordance was seen between the two methods for subtyping (96%) and majority variant detection (97.9%). NGS sequencing detected more variants and DRMs than Sanger sequencing. Of the 76 patient samples 86% (n = 66) had identical drug resistance reports. From the ten discrepant reports, nine had extra DRMs detected by NGS sequencing and all discrepancies were seen for NRTI and NNRTI antiviral resistance. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a good performance of the NGS method for HIV-1 genotyping compared to the Sanger sequencing method for detection of majority variants, however the reproducibility for the detection of minority variants was sub-optimal. Adoption of an NGS sequencing approach has the potential to improve the clinical management of HIV-infected patients.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1386653220301189;5.7;6.0;5.9;13866532;104376;;

We report week-144 efficacy and safety results from these studies. Methods: We did two double-blind, active-controlled studies (now in open-label extension phase). Study 1 randomly assigned (1:1) HLA-B*5701-negative adults without hepatitis B virus co-infection to receive coformulated bictegravir 50 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg, or coformulated dolutegravir 50 mg, abacavir 600 mg, and lamivudine 300 mg once daily. Study 2 randomly assigned (1:1) adults to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, or dolutegravir 50 mg given with coformulated emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg. We previously reported non-inferiority at the primary endpoint. Here, we report the week-144 secondary outcome of proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL at week 144, by US Food and Drug Administration Snapshot algorithm, analysed in the same manner. These studies were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02607930 and NCT02607956. Findings: 629 participants were randomly assigned and treated in study 1 (314 to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, and 315 to dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine) and 645 in study 2 (327 to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, 325 to dolutegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide). At week 144, bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide was non-inferior to both dolutegravir-containing regimens for efficacy. In study 1, 256 (82%) of 314 participants had plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL in the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group and 265 (84%) of 315 in the dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine group (difference 2·6%, 95% CI 8·5 to 3·4). In study 2, 262 (82%) of 320 participants had plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL in the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group and 273 (84%) of 325 in the dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group (difference 1·9%, 7·8 to 3·9). In both studies, no participant had treatment-emergent resistance to study drugs up to week 144. All treatment regimens were well tolerated with additional exposure. Adverse events that led to study drug discontinuation were reported for no participants in the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group versus five (2%) of 315 in the dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine group (study 1), and six (2%) of 320 in the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide versus six (2%) of 325 in the dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group (study 2). In study 1, statistically significant differences were observed in median changes from baseline in fasting total cholesterol (14 mg/dL vs 10 mg/dL; p=0·034), direct LDL (21 mg/dL vs 14 mg/dL; p=0·004), and total cholesterol to HDL ratio (0·1 vs 0·3; p=0·007) at week 144; no differences were observed between groups in study 2. Weight gain was seen across all treatment groups in both studies, with no differences in median changes from baseline in weight at week 144 for either study. Interpretation: These long-term data support the use of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide as a safe, well tolerated, and durable treatment for people with HIV, with no emergent resistance.

Thus, investigations into simpler regimens with comparable efficacy and improved safety have been undertaken and continue to be conducted. Various 2-drug combinations have been evaluated with variable results. The combinations of dolutegravir plus lamivudine and dolutegravir plus rilpivirine were found to be comparable in efficacy to conventional 3-drug regimens and have now been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have entered into clinical practice. Dolutegravir/rilpivirine was approved for the treatment of adults with HIV-1 infection whose virus has been suppressed on a stable regimen for at least 6 months, with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of the combination. Dolutegravir/lamivudine was approved for the treatment of HIV infection in adults with no antiretroviral treatment history and with no known or suspected resistance to the individual components of the combination.;http://journals.prous.com/journals/servlet/xmlxsl/pk_journals.xml_summary_pr?p_JournalId=4&p_RefId=3131482&p_IsPs=N;2.3;2.2;2.0;16993993;;;

We assessed the prevalence of PDR and treatment outcomes among adults living with HIV-1 in Lilongwe, Malawi. Methods: We selected 200 participants at random from the Lighthouse Tenofovir Cohort Study (LighTen). Serum samples were drawn prior to treatment initiation in 2014 and 2015, frozen, and later analyzed for the presence of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations. Amplicons were sequenced and interpreted by Stanford HIVdb interpretation algorithm 8.4. We assessed treatment outcomes by evaluating clinical outcome and viral suppression at the end of the follow-up period in October 2019. Results: PDR testing was successful in 197 of 200 samples. The overall NNRTI- PDR prevalence was 13.7% (27/197). The prevalence of intermediate or high level NNRTI- PDR was 11.2% (22/197). The most common mutation was K103N (5.6%, 11/197), followed by Y181C (3.6%, 7/197). In one case, we detected an NRTI resistance mutation (M184V), in combination with multiple NNRTI resistance mutations. All HIV-1 isolates analyzed were of subtype C. Of the 27 patients with NNRTI- PDR, 9 were still alive, on ART, and virally suppressed at the end of follow-up. Conclusion: The prevalence of NNRTI- PDR was above the critical level of 10% suggested by the Global Action Plan on HIV Drug Resistance. The distribution of drug resistance mutations was similar to that seen in previous studies from the region, and further supports the introduction of integrase inhibitors in first-line treatment in Malawi. Furthermore, our findings underline the need for continued PDR surveillance and pharmacovigilance in Sub-Saharan Africa.;https://aidsrestherapy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12981-020-00282-3;3.2;3.8;4.4;;22;;

Materials and methods We studied the association between HIV subtypes and immunologic and virologic outcomes in a longitudinal cohort of 169 patients on combination antiretroviral therapy. Participants were followed up for 5 years. Demographic data, CD4 cell count and viral loads (VL) were extracted from medical records. Whole protease gene and codon 1–300 of the reverse transcriptase gene were sequenced and analysed. Results Sixty-four percent of participants were females with a median age of 35 years. Twelve different subtypes were observed, the commonest being CRF 02_AG (55.0%) and subtypes G (23.1%). All subtypes showed steady rise in CD4 count and there was no difference in proportion who achieved CD4+ cell count rise of 100 cells/L from baseline within 12 months’ post-initiation of ART, or 350 cells/L at 60 months’ post-initiation. Median time to attaining a rise of 350 cells/L was 24 months (6–48 months). The proportion that achieved undetectable VL at month 6 and 12 post-initiation of ART were comparable across subtypes. At end of 5th year, there was no statistical difference in proportion with virologic failure. Conclusion No association between HIV subtypes and immunologic or virologic response to therapy was observed, suggesting that current first-line ART may have similar efficacy across subtype predominating in South-West Nigeria.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238027;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0238027;;

This trial assessed if patients with sustained low-level HIV-1 viremia on first-line ART benefit from a switch to second-line treatment. Methods and findings This multicenter, parallel-group, open-label, superiority, randomized controlled trial enrolled patients on first-line ART containing non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) with two consecutive VLs 100 copies/mL, with the second VL between 100-999 copies/mL, from eight clinics in Lesotho. Consenting participants were randomly assigned (1:1), stratified by facility, demographic group, and baseline VL, to either switch to second-line ART (switch group) or continued first-line ART (control group; WHO guidelines). The primary endpoint was viral suppression (<50 copies/mL) at 36 weeks. Analyses were by intention to treat, using logistic regression models, adjusted for demographic group and baseline VL. Between August 1, 2017, and August 7, 2019, 137 individuals were screened, of whom 80 were eligible and randomly assigned to switch (n = 40) or control group (n = 40). The majority of participants were female (54 [68%]) with a median age of 42 y (interquartile range [IQR] 35-51), taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine/efavirenz (49 [61%]) and on ART for a median of 5.9 y (IQR 3.3-8.6). At 36 weeks, 22/40 (55%) participants in the switch versus 10/40 (25%) in the control group achieved viral suppression (adjusted difference 29%, 95% CI 8%-50%, p = 0.009). The switch group had significantly higher probability of viral suppression across different VL thresholds (<20, <100, <200, <400, and <600 copies/mL) but not for <1,000 copies/mL. Thirty-four (85%) participants in switch group and 21 (53%) in control group experienced at least one adverse event (AE) (p = 0.002). No hospitalization or death or other serious adverse events were observed. Study limitations include a follow-up period too short to observe differences in clinical outcomes, missing values in CD4 cell counts due to national stockout of reagents during the study, and limited generalizability of findings to other than NNRTI-based first-line ART regimens. Conclusions In this study, switching to second-line ART among patients with sustained low-level HIV-1 viremia resulted in a higher proportion of participants with viral suppression. These results endorse lowering the threshold for virologic failure in future WHO guidelines.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003325;14.1;15.5;15.5;15491277;1003325;;

Such exposure might have implications on cross-resistance to dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapies (ART). Case presentation: We report a 65 years old Cameroonian, previously exposed to raltegravir, and failing on third-line treatment with multi-drug resistance to darunavir/r and dolutegravir. Genotypic resistance testing (GRT) and viral tropism were performed during monitoring time points. The patient initiated ART in August 2007. At the time point of the first (29.04.2010), second (01.12.2017) and third (08.08.2019) GRT, prior ART exposure included 3TC, d4T, NVP and EFV; additionally TDF, DRV/r and RAL; and additionally ABC and DTG respectively. First GRT revealed mutations associated with resistance only to first-generation Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Second GRT revealed mutations associated with high-level resistance to all NRTIs, first generation NNRTIs, all ritonavir boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r), and all INSTI, while viral tropism (using geno2pheno) revealed a CCR5-tropic virus with a false positive rate (FPR) of 60.9% suggesting effectiveness of maraviroc (MRV). The third GRT showed high-level resistance to NRTI, NNRTI, all PI and all INSTI, with additional mutations (H221HY for NNRTI and S147G for INSTI), and a CCR5-tropic virus with a slightly reduced FPR (57.0%). Without any locally available active therapeutic option, the patient has been on a maintenance therapy with ""DRV/r (600mg x 2/day)+TDF+3TC""and patient/family-centered adherence has been reinforced.

Understanding the prevalence and patterns of HIVDR in this population (15-24 years) will contribute to defining effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, improving clinical decision making, and supporting behavioral change interventions needed to achieve HIV epidemic control. Methods A cross-sectional analysis of study enrollment data from the Project YES! Youth Engaging for Success randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants were 15 to 24 years old, who knew their HIV status, and had been on ART for at least 6 months. All participants completed a survey and underwent viral load (VL) testing. Participants with viral failure (VL 1,000 copies/mL) underwent HIVDR testing which included analysis of mutations in the protease and reverse transcriptase genes. Results A total of 99 out of 273 analyzed participants receiving ART had VL failure, of whom 77 had successful HIVDR amplification and analysis. Out of the 77, 75% (58) had at least one drug resistant mutation, among which 83% (48/58) required a drug change. Among the 58 with HIVDR mutations, the prevalence of at least one HIVDR mutation to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) were 81%, 65.5% and 1.7%. The mutation M184V which confers resistance to NRTI drugs of lamivudine (3TC) and emtricitabine (FTC) was the most common (81%) among NRTI associated mutations followed by K65R (34.5%) which is associated with both tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) resistance. Thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs) which confer resistance primarily to zidovudine (AZT), stavudine (d4T) and other NRTIs were observed at 32.8%. Common TAMs were K70RTQNE (32.8%), K219QE (22.4%), D67N (17.2%) and T215IT (15.5%). The most common NNRTI associated mutation was the K103N (65.5%) which confers resistance to both efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP). There was a relatively high occurrence of other NNRTI mutations V106A (36.2%), as well as Y188C (36.2%) and Y181C (36.2%) which confer resistance to etravirine. Conclusions There is a high prevalence of HIVDR including TAMs despite majority of these patients (90.48%) being on AZT or d4T sparing first line ART among the youth. Emergence of these mutations including the NNRTI associated mutations (Y181C and Y188C) may compromise future second- and third-line regimens in the absence of routine HIVDR testing. HIVDR monitoring at start of ART or at first-line failure can better inform clinical decision making and ART programing.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236156;5.7;5.4;5.2;;e0236156;;

This cross-sectional study enrolled 170 HIV-1-infected individuals of three major ethnicities who attended three HIV outpatient clinics in Malaysia. Questionnaire was used to obtain sociodemographic data while CD4 count and viral load data were gathered from hospital's record. Multiple factors were assessed for their predictive effects on CD4 count recovery (500 cells/mm3) and viral load suppression (50 copies/mL) using binary logistic regression. Most of the subjects were male (149/87.6%), in the age group 30 to 39 years old (78/45.9%) and got infected via homosexual contact (82/48.2%). Indians were associated with 11 times higher chance for CD4 recovery as compared to Malays at 8 to 12 months of HAART (adjusted OR: 10.948, 95% CI: 1.873, 64.001, P =.008). Viral load suppression was positively influenced by intravenous drug use (IVDU) status (adjusted OR: 35.224, 95% CI: 1.234, 1000.489, P =.037) at 4 to 6 months of HAART. Higher pretreatment CD4 count was a positive predictor for both initial immunological and virological responses while higher pretreatment viral load was a negative predictor for virological suppression only. In conclusion, ethnicity plays a significant role in determining early immune reconstitution in Malaysia, besides pretreatment CD4 count. Further studies are needed to identify possible biological factors underlying this association.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25680;3.8;3.9;4.0;01466615;;;

PrEP could fill an important HIV prevention gap, especially for sexually active young women who are limited in their ability to negotiate mutual monogamy or condom use. As PrEP is scaled up in high HIV incidence settings, it is crucial to consider the importance of early identification of HIV infection during PrEP use, to allow for rapid discontinuation of PrEP to reduce the risk of antiretroviral (ARV) resistance. The purpose of this case study is to provide this critical evidence. Case presentation: This report describes a 20-year-old woman in a HIV sero-discordant relationship who initiated oral PrEP (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC)) through a demonstration project (CAPRISA 084) in October 2017. Despite good adherence throughout her PrEP use, she tested HIV antibody positive at month nine of study participation. Retrospective testing showed increasing HIV viral load over time, and retrospective use of fourth-generation rapid HIV tests showed HIV detection (positive antigen/antibody) at month one. Sequencing confirmed a dominant wild type at month one with dual therapy resistance patterns emerging by month three (M184V and K65R mutations), which is suggestive of protracted PrEP use during an undetected HIV infection. The participant was referred to infectious diseases for further management of her HIV infection and was initiated on a first line, tenofovir-sparing regimen. At the time of this report (January 2020), the participant had been on ARV- therapy (ART) for 13 months and had no signs of either clinical, immunologic or virologic failure. Conclusions: This case report highlights the importance of appropriate HIV screening during wider oral PrEP scale-up in high HIV incidence settings to circumvent the consequences of prolonged dual therapy in an undiagnosed HIV infection and in turn prevent ARV resistance.;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05255-5;4.5;4.3;4.1;;532;;

Objective: To explore the effectiveness and safety, in particular NP-AEs, of DTG/ABC/3TC in a cohort of HIV-1 adult infected patients. Pill burden, adherence to this STR, and the impact of switching on costs were also evaluated. Methods: This was an observational, retrospective study. The study population included antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive and treatment-experienced (TE) patients who started DTG/ABC/3TC between February 1, 2016, and October 31, 2016. Effectiveness and safety were analyzed at week 48 (W48) by intention-to-treat analysis. The Cox regression model was used to investigate predictors of DTG/ABC/3TC discontinuation. Results: A total of 253 patients were included (44 ART naïve, 209 TE). At W48, the proportion of patients with virological suppression was 72.7% (95% CI = 58.4-87.0) in ART-naive patients, 85.6% (95% CI = 80.3-90.9) in previously suppressed TE patients, and 86.4% (95% CI = 65.1-97.1) in previously not suppressed TE patients. The rate of protocol-defined virological failure was 4.3%. The incidence of AEs was higher in the subgroup of ART-naive patients (56.1% vs 39.0%), with a rate of interruptions for this reason of 13.6% and 7.6%, respectively. The incidence of NP-AEs was 20.6%, with 3.9% of patients requiring discontinuation. Patients who had switched from a raltegravir-containing regimen discontinued DTG/ABC/3TC because of AEs more frequently (relative risk = 2.83; 95% CI = 1.04-7.72; P = 0.041) in the multivariate analysis. After switching to DTG/ABC/3TC, the median pill burden was reduced from 3 to 1 and the proportion of patients with an adherence <90%, from 20.1% to 12.0%. The annual per-patient ART costs increased by €48 (0.6% increase). Conclusion and Relevance: DTG/ABC/3TC is an effective strategy as first-line and switching ART. Our data suggest a worse tolerance in ART-naive patients, although the rate of discontinuation resulting from NP-AEs was relatively low. In the short-term, the adherence was slightly improved without significant changes in costs.";http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1060028019896638;5.7;5.2;4.3;10600280;;;

Recent studies have shown that clonal expansion of latently infected cells without viral reactivation is an important phenomenon that maintains the long-term stability of the reservoir, yet its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we report that a subset of CD4 T cells, characterized by CD161 expression on the surface, is highly permissive for HIV-1 infection. These cells possess a signicantly higher survival and proliferative capacity than their CD161-negative counterparts. More importantly, we found that these cells harbor HIV-1 DNA and replication-competent latent viruses at a signicantly higher frequency. By using massive single-genome proviral sequencing from ART-suppressed individuals, we conrm that CD161CD4 T cells contain remarkably more identical proviral sequences, indicating clonal expansion of the viral genome in these cells. Taking the results together, our study identies infected CD161CD4 T cells to be a critical force driving the clonal expansion of the HIV-1 latent reservoir, providing a novel mechanism for the long-term stability of HIV-1 latency. IMPORTANCE The latent reservoir continues to be the major obstacle to curing HIV-1 infection. The clonal expansion of latently infected cells adds another layer maintaining the long-term stability of the reservoir, but its mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that CD161+ CD4+ T cells serve as an important compartment of the HIV-1 latent reservoir and contain a significant amount of clonally expanded proviruses. In our study, we describe a feasible strategy that may reduce the size of the latent reservoir to a certain extent by counterbalancing the repopulation and dissemination of latently infected cells.;https://mbio.asm.org/content/10/5/e02121-19;11.2;10.5;9.9;21612129;e02121-19;;

All rights reserved.Background: Recently, many broadly applicable and potent neutralizing antibodies have been screened from HIV-1-infected patients. However, all these effective neutralizing antibodies were isolated from patients naive to antiretroviral treatment (ART). Methods: To better understand the induction of neutralizing antibodies in patients on ART, we screened 3 patients with an over ten-year infection history on ART from 350 patients in China for a cross-reactive neutralizing antibody response based on the use of different antigens and recombinant viruses. We studied the evolution of neutralizing activity in two patients during a one-year period with previously described recombinant viruses NL4-3 and SF162 using ELISA and neutralization assays. Results: Antibodies purified from sera were able to react with recombinant virus antigens R2-gp120 and SF162-gp140 and neutralize SF162 recombinant virus but not NL4-3 recombinant virus. In addition, we observed a significant increase in the neutralizing response of immunoglobulin G (IgG) isolated from the serum sample in Patient 1 and compared it with the serum from Patient 1 six months ago. Conclusions: We thus confirm the possibility of production of neutralizing antibodies in patients infected for over ten years on ART, and it is possible over time of the improvement of HIV-1 potent neutralizing activity associated with viremia and immune reconstruction.;http://www.clin-lab-publications.com/article/3059;1.6;1.5;1.5;14336510;;;

Here, we compared HIV-1 minority variants at baseline, through plasma RNA and PBMC DNA analyses, and the dominant variants at the virological failure (VF) point, to evaluate the impact of minority drug-resistant variants (MDRVs) on virological outcomes. Methods: Single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRTS) was performed on baseline RNA and DNA. The Stanford HIV-1 drug resistance database was used for the identification and evaluation of drug resistance-associated mutations (DRAMs). Results: We classified 50 patients into virological success (VS) and VF groups. We found that the rates of reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) DRAMs determined by SMRTS did not differ significantly within or between groups, whether based on RNA or DNA analyses. There was no significant difference in the level of resistance to specific drugs between groups, in either DNA or RNA analyses, except for the DNA-based analysis of lamivudine, for which there was a trend towards a higher prevalence of intermediate/high-level resistance in the VF group. The RNA MDRVs corresponded to DNA MDRVs, except for M100I and Y188H. Sequencing from DNA appeared to be more sensitive than from RNA to detect MDRVs. Conclusions: Detection of pretreatment minority HIV-1 RTI-resistant variants by UDS showed that MDRVs at baseline were not significantly associated with virological outcome. However, HIV-1 DNA sequencing by UDS was useful for detecting pretreatment drug resistance mutations in patients, potentially affecting virological responses, suggesting a potential clinical relevance for ultra-deep DNA sequencing.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/74/5/1408/5296302;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;

Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 licenseBackground: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up in sub-Saharan Africa combined with weak routine virological monitoring has driven increasing HIV drug resistance. We investigated ART failure, drug resistance, and early mortality among patients with HIV admitted to hospital in Malawi. Methods: This observational cohort study was nested within the rapid urine-based screening for tuberculosis to reduce AIDS-related mortality in hospitalised patients in Africa (STAMP) trial, which recruited unselected (ie, irrespective of clinical presentation) adult (aged 18 years) patients with HIV-1 at admission to medical wards. Patients were included in our observational cohort study if they were enrolled at the Malawi site (Zomba Central Hospital) and were taking ART for at least 6 months at admission. Patients who met inclusion criteria had frozen plasma samples tested for HIV-1 viral load. Those with HIV-1 RNA of at least 1000 copies per mL had drug resistance testing by ultra-deep sequencing, with drug resistance defined as intermediate or high-level resistance using the Stanford HIVDR program. Mortality risk was calculated 56 days from enrolment. Patients were censored at death, at 56 days, or at last contact if lost to follow-up. The modelling strategy addressed the causal association between HIV multidrug resistance and mortality, excluding factors on the causal pathway (most notably, CD4 cell count, clinical signs of advanced HIV, and poor functional and nutritional status). Findings: Of 1316 patients with HIV enrolled in the STAMP trial at the Malawi site between Oct 26, 2015, and Sept 19, 2017, 786 had taken ART for at least 6 months. 252 (32%) of 786 patients had virological failure (viral load 1000 copies per mL). Mean age was 41·5 years (SD 11·4) and 528 (67%) of 786 were women. Of 237 patients with HIV drug resistance results available, 195 (82%) had resistance to lamivudine, 128 (54%) to tenofovir, and 219 (92%) to efavirenz. Resistance to at least two drugs was common (196, 83%), and this was associated with increased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1·7, 95% CI 1·2–2·4; p=0·0042). Interpretation: Interventions are urgently needed and should target ART clinic, hospital, and post-hospital care, including differentiated care focusing on patients with advanced HIV, rapid viral load testing, and routine access to drug resistance testing. Prompt diagnosis and switching to alternative ART could reduce early mortality among inpatients with HIV.
