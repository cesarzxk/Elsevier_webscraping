The design problem is constructed as a phase optimization problem between the desired and designed phase response of a filter. In order to achieve the highly accurate passband (pb) response, phase response is fitted to desired response more precisely using FDC, due to which design problem becomes a multimodal error surface that is constructed from sum of passband error (ep) and stopband error (es). Optimal value of FDC is accomplished by minimizing the total error (er0) using improved swarm-based optimization technique, which is formulated by associating the scout bee mechanism of artificial bee colony algorithm with particle swarm optimization and termed as hybrid particle swarm optimization. The simulated results reflect that the improved response in passband along with better transition width is achieved using the proposed method. It is observed that about 90–99% of improvement in passband error can be achieved with 100% reduction in maximum passband ripple. However, slight reduction in stopband attenuation (As), in some cases, results within the permissible limit. The designed filters using this method are also stable toward finite word length effect.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00034-020-01456-0;3.3;3.6;3.8;;;;;;

Therefore, it's vital to find pharmacological treatments for managing PD-associated pain symptoms, to improve patients' quality of life. For this reason, we tested the possible synergy between L-DOPA and celecoxib in decreasing allodynia and hyperalgesia induced by unilateral lesioning with 6-OHDA into the SNpc in rats. We also tested whether the antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effect induced by combination of L-DOPA and celecoxib is mediated by the NO–cGMP–ATP-sensitive K+ channel pathway. Tactile allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia were evaluated using von Frey filament. Isobolographic analyses were employed to define the nature of the drug interaction using a fixed dose ratio (0.5: 0.5). We found that acute and sub-acute (10-day) treatment with a single dose of L-DOPA (3–25 mg/kg, i. p.) or celecoxib (2.5–20 mg/kg, i. p.) induced a dose-dependent antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effect in parkinsonian rats. Isobolographic analysis revealed that the ED50 values obtained by L-DOPA + celecoxib combination was significantly less than calculated additive values, indicating that co-administration of L-DOPA with celecoxib produces synergistic interactions in its antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effect in animals with nigrostriatal lesions. Moreover, the antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects induced by L-DOPA + celecoxib combination were blocked by intrathecal pre-treatment with L-NAME, ODQ, and glibenclamide. Taken together, the data suggest that L-DOPA + celecoxib combination produces an antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic synergistic interaction at the systemic level, and these effects are mediated, at the central level, through activation of the NO–cGMP–ATP-sensitive K+ channel pathway.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014299920306294;5.7;5.9;5.5;S0014299920306294;32971091;173537;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0014299920306294;;

Liver function tests were found to be worsening with severe drop in CD4 counts. An extensive workup for pyrexia was done. FNAC and biopsy of lymph node showed features suggestive of granulomatous lymphadenitis. CBNAAT of the lymph node aspirate was negative for MTB. Blood culture and lymph node cultures were negative for Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC). MAC was however, finally detected and reported positive on Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) of the cervical lymph node aspirate. Prompt treatment for MAC was initiated with Ethambutol 800 mg OD and Azithromycin 500 mg OD following which fever spikes subsided and lymph node resolved. The Patient's condition gradually improved and was discharged shortly with a good recovery on subsequent follow ups. Fever is one of the common symptoms in patients with MAC infection. Some other clinical manifestations include weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly and intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy. Diagnostic evaluation should be aggressive. As there is a high risk for MAC infection in advanced HIV cases with poor HAART compliance, FISH can be a valuable and effective diagnostic tool in early detection and treatment of MAC.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2405579420300528;0.7;1.6;1.8;S2405579420300528;;100188;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2405579420300528;;

The cortico-spinal tract (CST) is critical for voluntary motor control. Although neuroimaging work has identified anomalous microstructural properties in the CST in ADHD, no study to date has attempted to investigate the link between deficits in fine motor performance and microstructural properties of the CST in children with ADHD. This study aimed to address this gap using a novel fixel-based analysis (FBA). Methods: Participants were 50 right-handed medication naïve children with a history of ADHD and 56 non-ADHD controls aged 9–11 years. Fine motor control was assessed using the Grooved Pegboard task. Children underwent high angular resolution diffusion MRI. Following pre-processing, FBA was performed and the semi-automated deep-learning TractSeg was used to delineate the CST bilaterally. Fibre density (FD), fibre cross-section (FC-log), and fibre density/cross-section (FDC) were extracted for each tract. Results: Children with ADHD performed significantly worse than non-ADHD children on the Grooved Pegboard task when using their non-dominant hand. They also demonstrated widespread significantly lower diffusion metrics in both CSTs compared to non-ADHD controls. However, no correlations were observed between Grooved Pegboard performance and diffusion metrics for the CST in either hemisphere. Conclusions: While we failed to detect a significant relationship between fine motor skill and FBA metrics in either group, this paper extends previous work by showing that children with ADHD and reduced fine motor competence demonstrate atypical microstructure within the CST relative to non-ADHD controls.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0278584620304413;8.1;6.6;7.4;S0278584620304413;33031859;110125;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0278584620304413;;

In the development of a once daily, inhaled fixed dose combination (FDC) of indacaterol, glycopyrronium bromide (a long-acting muscarinic antagonist), and mometasone furoate (an inhaled corticosteroid [ICS]) for the treatment of patients with asthma, the acetate salt of indacaterol is used instead of the maleate salt. Here, we investigated the lung function, pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of indacaterol maleate 150 g once daily (o.d.) and indacaterol acetate 150 g o.d. in comparison with placebo. Methods: This was a randomised, double-blind, three-period crossover study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT03257995) in patients with asthma on background ICS therapy. Patients with percent predicted pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume per second (FEV1) 50% and  90% were included in the study. Patients received indacaterol maleate 150 g o.d., indacaterol acetate 150 g o.d., or placebo on top of stable background ICS in randomised sequence. Trough FEV1 was assessed after 14 days of treatment. PK of indacaterol salts were assessed at steady state after 14 days of treatment; peak expiratory flow (PEF) rate and rescue medication use were collected with a combined PEF-meter/electronic diary throughout the study. Results: Of the 54 adult patients (median age of 48 years), 51 patients completed the study. Both indacaterol salts demonstrated statistically significant improvements in trough FEV1 of 186 mL (maleate) and 146 mL (acetate) compared with placebo (both P < 0.001). FEV1 AUC0-4h improved by 248 mL (maleate) and 245 mL (acetate), and PEF by 33 L/min (maleate) and 30.8 L/min (acetate) versus placebo. Systemic exposure of indacaterol (AUC0-24h,ss and Cmax,ss on Day 14) was comparable after administration of both salt forms. Both salt forms demonstrated a good safety profile and were well tolerated, with a difference in the reporting frequency of AEs of coughing (maleate, 23.5%; acetate, 0%). Conclusions: In patients with asthma, indacaterol maleate and acetate elicited comparable and significant improvements in lung function compared with placebo and achieved comparable systemic exposure. Both indacaterol salts were safe and well tolerated.

They are prescribed with fixed-dose combination (FDC) antihypertensive therapy rather than monotherapies. Although it is commonly admitted that the use of FDC may improve compliance to treatment, adherence rates in patients receiving FDCs have not been documented. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the adherence to treatment in patients receiving FDCs of antihypertensive medications in a real-world setting in Egypt. Results: We conducted a multi-center cross-sectional study over a period of 1 year from Jan 2017 to Jan 2018. We included patients above 21 years old with essential hypertension who were already prescribed with an FDC of antihypertensive treatment for at least 3-month duration. We assessed the adherence to treatment by patient self-assessment using the Morisky 8-Item Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS 8). This study enrolled 2000 hypertensive Egyptian patients. The mean age of enrolled patients was 55.8 ± 10.9 years. Male to female ratio was 1.08. The mean MMAS score was 6.5 ± 1.9. Our analysis showed that 825 (41.3%) patients reached high adherence score, 523 (26.2%) medium adherence, and 652 (32.6%) low adherence. Furthermore, Male patients showed higher adherence rate than females (56.4% versus 43.6%, p < 0.001). Out of 746 patients with controlled blood pressure (< 140/90), 387 (51.9%) patients were highly adherent to treatment. Higher level of education was significantly associated with high adherence rate; 559 (67.8%) patients were university graduates, 232 (28.1%) had primary/secondary school education, and 34 (4.1%) were illiterate (p < 0.001). Moreover, once daily (99.2%) fixed-dose combination was associated with higher adherence rate than twice regimen daily (0.8%), p = 0.03. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that patients with high level of education, employed patients, and patients with controlled blood pressure have high adherence rate to medication. Conclusions: Higher adherence to medication is associated with high level of education and employment, and it can lead to better blood pressure control. Thus, patient education programs may increase patients’ adherence to their medication.";https://tehj.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s43044-020-00044-6;0.6;0.6;0.7;;;10;;;

While central nervous system IRIS (CNS IRIS) is thought to be prevalent in resource limited settings (RLS), its identification is constrained by limited data on pre-treatment HIV disease and diagnostic testing. A diagnosis can be improved with neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies, which are not universally available in RLS. This study evaluated whether diagnoses of CNS IRIS could be achieved in a resource limited setting based on established criteria. Methods: A retrospective chart review of HIV+ individuals, on ARVs at the time of presentation in two cohort studies of suspected CNS opportunistic infection or tuberculous (TB) meningitis who were admitted to a tertiary care facility in Lusaka, Zambia. Results: Using currently validated criteria, none of the 254 participants evaluated could be diagnosed with CNS IRIS, as there was no information on post-treatment trajectory of HIV viral loads or CD4 counts. Only one participant had a definitive, non-IRIS infectious diagnosis based on comprehensive testing. Of the remaining 253 patients, 68 (27%) had an identified potential CNS pathogen, 92 (36%) had inflammatory CSF in the absence of a pathogen, and 94 (37%) had normal CSF despite presenting with CNS symptoms. Conclusion: The absence of HIV disease trajectory data, and lack of comprehensive diagnostic testing, compounded by a high prevalence of infectious pathogens, substantially limits the ability to diagnose CNS IRIS in RLS.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022510X20303798;4.1;4.4;4.9;S0022510X20303798;32712429;117042;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0022510X20303798;;

Previous supraspinal investigations have primarily focused on cortical changes in this patient population. As the nexus between the brain and the spinal cord, the brainstem has been understudied in patients with DCM. The current study examined the structural and functional connectivity between the brainstem and cortex in DCM patients using probabilistic tractography and resting-state functional MRI. A total of 26 study patients and 32 neurologically intact, healthy volunteers (HCs) participated in this prospective analysis. The study cohort included DCM patients (n = 18), as well as neurologically asymptomatic patients with evidence of cervical spine degenerative changes and spinal cord compression (n = 8). Results of the study demonstrated significant differences in fiber density (FD), fiber cross-section (FDC), and the functional connectivity (FC) between the study cohort and HCs. Through seeding the brainstem, the study cohort showed reductions in FD and FDC along the corticospinal tract, including regions extending through the corona radiata and internal capsule. By correlating FD and FDC with the Neck Disability Index (NDI), and the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA), we identified increasing total volume of projections to the thalamus, basal ganglia, and internal capsule, and increased functional connectivity to visual network and the posterior parietal cortices. These results support our hypothesis that DCM patients tend to have long-term FC reorganization not only localized to sensorimotor regions, but also to regulatory and visual processing regions, designed to ultimately preserve neurological function.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S000689932030487X;5.6;6.2;5.4;S000689932030487X;32950486;147129;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S000689932030487X;;

Drug repurposing, combination therapy or nanotechnology were explored to improve antischistosomal treatment. The aim of the present study was to utilize a novel combination of the three strategies to improve the therapeutic profile of praziquantel. This was based on a fixed-dose nanocombination of praziquantel and miltefosine, an antischistosomal repurposing candidate, co-loaded at reduced doses into lipid nanocapsules, for single dose oral therapy. Methods: Two nanocombinations were prepared to provide 250 mg praziquantel-20 mg miltefosine/kg (higher fixed-dose) or 125 mg praziquantel-10 mg miltefosine/kg (lower fixed-dose), respectively. Their antischistosomal efficacy in comparison with a non-treated control and their praziquantel or miltefosine singly loaded counterparts was assessed in murine schistosomiasis mansoni. A single oral dose of either formulation was administered on the initial day of infection, and on days 21 and 42 post-infection. Scanning electron microscopic, parasitological, and histopathological studies were used for assessment. Preclinical data were subjected to analysis of variance and Tukey's post-hoc test for pairwise comparisons. Results: Lipid nanocapsules ( 58 nm) showed high entrapment efficiency of both drugs (> 97%). Compared to singly loaded praziquantel-lipid nanocapsules, the higher nanocombination dose showed a significant increase in antischistosomal efficacy in terms of statistically significant decrease in mean worm burden, particularly against invasive and juvenile worms, and amelioration of hepatic granulomas (P  0.05). In addition, scanning electron microscopy examination showed extensive dorsal tegumental damage with noticeable deposition of nanostructures. Conclusions: The therapeutic profile of praziquantel could be improved by a novel multiple approach integrating drug repurposing, combination therapy and nanotechnology. Multistage activity and amelioration of liver pathology could be achieved by a new praziquantel-miltefosine fixed-dose nanocombination providing 250 mg praziquantel-20 mg miltefosine/kg. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a fixed-dose nano-based combinatorial therapy for schistosomiasis mansoni. Further studies are needed to document the nanocombination safety and explore its prophylactic activity and potential to hinder the onset of resistance to the drug components.[Figure not available: see fulltext.];https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-020-04346-1;5.7;5.4;5.3;;32933556;474;;;

Recent studies support the combined therapy approach using ARAs with 5-RI for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in BPH patients at risk of clinical progression. We aimed to review BPH management in select group of randomized controlled trials by combination therapy with ARAs and 5-RIs compared to monotherapy with either drug with respect to the safety and efficacy. A total of 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving comparison of combination therapy with monotherapy using ARAs and 5-RIs were retrieved from PubMed Central and reviewed for international prostate symptom score (IPSS), quality of life (QoL), post-residual urinary flow rate (PUF), and clinical progression. The results significantly favour the treatment group that received the combination therapy in comparison with the groups receiving monotherapy. However, outcome with regard to prostate volume showed insignificant improvement when the combination therapy is compared with 5- RIs alone, rather than ARAs. In conclusion, combination therapy using ARAs and 5-RI is better than monotherapy in the patients of BPH. Fixed dose combination (FDC), a type of combination, is also cost-effective and its side-effects profile resembles to that of monotherapy.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014299920303939;5.7;5.9;5.5;S0014299920303939;32592768;173301;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0014299920303939;;

Examples of such crimes include creating forged International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers which are embedded on mobile packages and inside smart mobile cases for illicit activities. Another example of such crimes is altering the name or date on air tickets for breaching security at the airport. This paper presents a new expert system for detecting forged IMEI numbers as well as altered air ticket images. The proposed method derives the phase spectrum using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to highlight the suspicious regions; it is unlike the phase spectrum from a Fourier transform, which is ineffective due to power spectrum noise. From the phase spectrum, our method extracts phase statistics to study the effect of distortions introduced by forgery operations. This results in feature vectors, which are fed to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for detection of forged IMEI numbers and air ticket images. Experimental results on our dataset of forged IMEI numbers (which is created by us for this work), on altered air tickets, on benchmark datasets of video caption text (which is tampered text), and on altered receipts of the ICPR 2018 FDC dataset, show that the proposed method is robust across different datasets. Furthermore, comparative studies of the proposed method with the existing methods on the same datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods.

The Phase IV SPRINT study was conducted in 10 countries in Europe to assess asthma disease control and COPD symptom burden in patients treated with a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta agonists (LABAs). SPRINT included 1101 patients with asthma and 560 with COPD; all were receiving treatment with an FDC of ICS/LABA, delivered via various inhalers. Data were obtained over a 3-month period, during a single routine physician’s office visit. Asthma control was defined as Asthma Control Test (ACT) score >19. COPD symptom burden was assessed by COPD Assessment Test (CAT), with a CAT score <10 defining low COPD symptom burden. Among patients using any ICS/LABA FDC, 62% of patients with asthma had achieved disease control (ACT score >19) and 16% of patients with COPD had low symptom burden (CAT score <10).";http://www.nature.com/articles/s41533-019-0159-1;3.9;4.4;5.1;;31911607;1;;;

This study is aimed at determining if any constituent of cART can induce cerebellar limb dysmetria and spatial memory impairments. Materials and methods: Forty adult male Wistar rats were randomly grouped into four (n = 10): control (distilled water 0.5 mL); Tenofovir (6 mg/kg); Lamivudine (6 mg/kg) and Efavirenz (12 mg/kg). The following neurobehavioral studies were conducted: open field, beam walk, and Morris water maze. Immunohistochemistry of CD 68 and GFAP were used to test for neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Results: There was marked increase in pyknotic pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and ghost Purkinje cells in the cerebellum of treatment groups. There was also a significant increase in oxidative stress in lamivudine and efavirenz groups. In addition, Lamivudine caused a significant increase of microglial and astrocytic activity (p < 0.001, 0.05 respectively) compared to control. The open field test showed a significant decrease (p < 0.0001) of the line crossing performance in the efavirenz, lamivudine and tenofovir (with means: 26.4, 4.6, 17.4 respectively) compared to control (50.6). There was also a significant decrease in the grooming (p < 0.05) and rearing (p < 0.01) in lamivudine group. Whereas, walk latency increased in efavirenz (p < 0.01), and lamivudine (p < 0.0001) compared to control. While hind limb slips significantly increased in efavirenz (p < 0.05) and lamivudine (p < 0.0001) compared with control group. Likewise, Lamivudine and Tenofovir exposed groups experienced a significant delay in the time to identify the hidden platform in compared to control (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Lamivudine altered efferent stimuli along the cerebellospinal tracts thereby causing motor impairments.

We have investigated the cellular source and functions of several prostanoids in the immune inflammatory responses using follicular dendritic cell (FDC)-like cells. In this study, we report a novel finding on the role of 15(S)- hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE). Our observation of 15(S)-HETE uptake by FDC-like cells prompted to hypothesize that 15(S)-HETE might have a regulatory role in the other branch of eicosanoid production. The effects of 15(S)-HETE on COX-2 expression and prostaglandin (PG) production were analyzed by immunoblotting and specific enzyme immunoassays. The addition of 15(S)-HETE resulted in elevated levels of COX-2 expression and PG production. The enhanced PG production was not due to growth stimulation of FDC-like cells since 15(S)-HETE did not modulate FDC-like cell proliferation by the culture period of PG measurement. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR) seems to mediate the augmenting activity as the antagonist GW9662 dose-dependently prevented 15(S)-HETE from increasing PG production. In addition, PPAR protein expression was readily detected in FDC-like cells. These effects of 15(S)-HETE were displayed in the combined addition with IL-1. Based on these results, we suggest that 15(S)-HETE is an inflammatory costimulator of FDC acting in a paracrine fashion.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1098882320300800;4.1;4.7;4.0;S1098882320300800;33007445;106487;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1098882320300800;;

Recent Findings: Recent clinical practice guidelines include FDC use for treating high BP. Clinical trials in recent years support the use of antihypertensive FDCs including low-dose triple- and quadruple-therapy FDCs. Initiating a low-to-standard dose dual-therapy FDCs showed better BP control than initiating treatment with a standard-dose monotherapy, and triple-therapy FDCs produced better BP control rates than dual-therapy FDCs. Retrospective cohort studies showed that FDCs are associated with increased medication adherence, reduced clinical inertia, decreased time to BP control, and improved cardiovascular outcomes. We further discussed barriers and facilitators of wider implementation of antihypertensive FDCs in clinical practice. Summary: FDC treatment for hypertension is not commonly used despite historical and recent data which support the effectiveness, safety, and benefits of FDCs. Simplified and protocolized treatment algorithms, team-based care, shared decision-making principles are crucial to successful utilization and implementation of FDC in clinical practice.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11906-020-01109-2;5.3;5.5;6.0;;33052522;95;;;

It affected 57% of South African patients whose antiretroviral therapy (ART) included stavudine and was influenced by genotypes of the P2X-block (P2X7R, P2X4R and CAMKK2). We investigate associations between HIV-SN and P2X-block genotypes in patients who never received stavudine. An adjacent gene, ANAPC5, was included. 75 HIV+ individuals were assessed using the Brief Peripheral Neuropathy Screen before treatment and after 6-8 months on stavudine-free regimens. DNA was genotyped for 48 polymorphisms across the four genes using an OpenArray™ platform. Haplotypes were derived using fastPHASE. Associations with HIV-SN were assessed using bivariate and multivariate analyses. Nine individuals (12%) were diagnosed with HIV-SN prior to ART and a further 20 individuals (27%) developed HIV-SN within 6-8 months. Five polymorphisms, rs503720*G (OR = 133) in P2X7R, rs10849861*A (OR = 5.99), rs1653586*T (OR = 67.8) and rs11065504*C (OR = 0.02) in CAMKK2, and rs2089886*A (OR = 6.68) in ANAPC5, associated with HIV-SN after adjusting for body weight, nadir CD4 T-cell counts and prior tuberculosis (model p < 0.0001, n = 69, Pseudo R2 = 0.54). Three CAMKK2 haplotypes were associated with HIV-SN (OR = 2.82, 3.42 and 6.85) after adjusting for body weight, nadir CD4 T-cell counts and prior tuberculosis (model p < 0.0005, n = 71, Pseudo R2 = 0.26). The results support a role for CAMKK2 in HIV-SN, independent of mechanisms invoked by stavudine. Significance statement: HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) remains a clinically relevant complication of HIV infection and its treatment, affecting 38% of patients treated without neurotoxic stavudine. HIV-SN can impact an individual's ability to work and quality of life, with few effective therapeutic options, so an understanding of the underlying mechanisms would have clinical value. We confirm that CAMKK2 polymorphisms and haplotypes influence susceptibility to HIV-SN in South Africans treated without stavudine. This provides further evidence for a role for the protein encoded by CAMKK2 in the pathogenesis of HIV-SN, independent of mechanisms initiated by stavudine.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022510X20303245;4.1;4.4;4.9;S0022510X20303245;32585444;116987;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0022510X20303245;;

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of reduced doses of both tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and efavirenz for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. In this open-label, non-inferiority trial, HIV-1-infected antiretroviral-naive adults were randomly assigned to receive either a lower dose anti-retroviral regimen comprised of TDF (200 mg), efavirenz (400 mg), and standard dose lamivudine (300 mg) or the standard dose regimen. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA 50 copies/mL at week 48 using a non-inferiority margin of -10%. At week 48, 79 of 92 (85.9%) participants in the lower dose regimen group and 78 of 92 (84.8%) in the standard dose regimen group achieved HIV-1 RNA 50 copies/mL (treatment difference 1.1%, 95% CI -9.1 to 11.3) in the intention-to-treat analysis. Drug-related adverse events occurred more frequently in the participants receiving the standard dose regimen compared with the lower dose one (63.0% vs 80.4%). Changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate and bone mineral density were comparable between the two groups. The non-inferior efficacy and better safety profile of the lower dose ARV regimen support its use as alternative initial therapy for HIV-1 infected patients.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2020.1752609;7.3;4.9;6.9;;32267205;;;;

As this requires a certain cognitive and physical functioning, it is of interest to investigate how this service contribute during the course of dementia. In this study we aim to explore the individual characteristics predicting dropout from FDC. Furthermore, we investigate whether the participants who drop out of the service continue to live at home with another day care service or if they move to a residential care facility. Methods: The study includes 92 people with dementia attending FDCs in Norway, assessed with standardized instruments at baseline between January 2017 and January 2018. They were followed for 1 year, and dropouts from FDC during this period were mapped. The association between individual characteristics and dropout was assessed using a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results: Thirty-eight people stopped attending FDCs during the study. Twenty-six moved to residential care. Among the 12 who continued to live in their own homes, 9 people started in a regular day care service. Higher score on educational level and more severe dementia, as well as lower scores on social support, increased the probability of stopping FDC. Conclusion: FDCs appeared as a service that is stable over time for most participants, as more than two-third could use the care facility until the need of residential care. The transfers within care services and levels of care seemed to be characterized by continuity. More research on the growing population of educated older adults with dementia are warranted, to facilitate for their course of care needs. Finally, extended knowledge is needed to improve the collaboration between private and public networks, such as day care services, to improve the experience of social support for people with dementia.;https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01826-y;4.1;4.0;4.4;;;428;;;

However, recurrent disease remains the primary barrier to long-term survival. We extended our 2-step approach to HLA-matched related HSCT using a radiation-based myeloablative conditioning regimen combined with a high dose of T cells in an attempt to reduce relapse rates while maintaining the beneficial effects of CY tolerization. After conditioning, patients received their grafts in 2 components: (1) a fixed dose of 2 × 108/kg T cells, followed 2 days later by CY, and (2) a CD34-selected graft containing a small residual amount of non-CY-exposed T cells, at a median dose of 2.98 × 103/kg. Forty-six patients with hematologic malignancies were treated. Despite the myeloablative conditioning regimen and use of high T cell doses, the cumulative incidences of grade II-IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, and NRM at 1 year and 5 years were very low, at 13%, 9%, and 4.3%, respectively. This contributed to a high overall survival of 89.1% at 1 year and 65.8% at 5 years. Relapse was the primary cause of mortality, with a cumulative incidence of 23.9% at 1 year and 45.7% at 5 years. In a post hoc analysis, relapse rates were significantly lower in patients receiving greater than versus those receiving less than the group median of non-CY-exposed residual T cells in the CD34 product (19.3% versus 58.1%; P =.009), without a concomitant increase in NRM.

To compare the virologic response and clinical failure between groups we used the Cox and Kaplan Meier proportional hazard models. To analyze the immunologic outcome, we used multilevel GLLAMM and mixed effect linear regression models. To compare regimen change outcomes we used the Pearson’s chi-square test. We included 840 participants distributed across the groups according to the initial ART regimen. The mean followup period was 27.8 months. Almost half the sample initiated ART with AIDS-related signs/ symptoms. Virologic response was effective in 79.6% of participants within 12 months. The tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz group presented a higher proportion of virologic response (VL<50 at 6 months) when compared to the zidovudine/lamivudine/efavirenz group. There was no difference between the regimens regarding the immunologic response. A total of 17.3% of individuals changed regimen because of failure and 46.5% due to adverse events. Changes due to adverse events were more frequent in the group using zidovudine/lamivudine/efavirenz. The proportion of hospitalizations at 1 year was higher in the zidovudine/ lamivudine/efavirenz group when compared to the tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz group. The effectiveness outcomes between the regimens were similar. Some differences may be due to the individual characteristics of patients, toxicity and acceptability of drugs. Studies are needed that compare similarly effective regimens and their respective treatment costs and financial impacts on SUS (Integrated Healthcare System).;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239527;5.7;5.4;5.2;;32986730;e0239527;;;

However, acquiring information at the single-cell level for live cancer cells is challenging when small collections of cells are being targeted. Here, we report single-cell analysis for low abundance cells enabled by fluorescent droplet cytometry (FDC), an approach that uses a biomarker-specific enzymatic fluorescent assay carried out using a droplet microfluidic platform. FDC utilizes DNA-functionalized antibodies in droplets to achieve specific on-cell target detection and enables characterization and profiling of live cancer cells with single-cell resolution based on their surface phenotype. Using this approach, we achieve live-cell phenotypic profiling of multiple surface markers acquired with small (<40 cells) collections of cells.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.0c05276;24.0;24.4;24.8;;32786736;;;;

In order to protect network security for these businesses in cloud computing, nowadays, a number of middleboxes are deployed at front-end of cloud computing or parts of middleboxes are deployed in cloud computing. However, the former is leading to high cost and management complexity, and also lacking of network security protection between virtual machines while the latter does not effectively prevent network attacks from external traffic. To address the above-mentioned challenges, we introduce a novel customized network security for cloud service (CNS), which not only prevents attacks from external and internal traffic to ensure network security of services in cloud computing, but also affords customized network security service for cloud users. CNS is implemented by modifying the Xen hypervisor and proved by various experiments which showing the proposed solution can be directly applied to the extensive practical promotion in cloud computing.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7974828/;8.2;10.9;13.3;;;7974828;;;

Since both cardiovascular and renal disease, and polypharmacy, are common in ageing people with HIV, there is a need for alternative efficacious regimens. bPI-based regimens are often the treatment of choice for individuals with pre-treatment or treatment-acquired resistance but it is plausible that carefully selected HIV-positive individuals with drug resistance, who are virologically suppressed on their current bPI regimen, could maintain virological efficacy when switched to bictegravir, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) fixed dose combination (FDC). Methods/design: A phase IV, investigator-initiated, multicentre, open label pilot, randomised two-arm study to assess the safety and efficacy of switching from bPI regimen to B/F/TAF single tablet regimen in integrase inhibitor-naïve, virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1 infection harbouring drug resistance mutations. Eligible individuals will either continue on their bPI regimen or switch to B/F/TAF FDC. After 24 weeks, all participants in the bPI arm will be switched to B/F/TAF and followed for a further 24 weeks and all participants will be followed for 48 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at week 24 using pure virologic response whilst the secondary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48. Other secondary outcome measures include between arm comparisons of drug resistance at virological failure, safety and tolerability and patient-reported outcome measures. Discussion: We aim to provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy of switching to B/F/TAF in patients with virological suppression on a bPI-based regimen who harbour select drug resistance mutations.

Malignant transformation is associated with the formation of a reactive stroma where cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) induce matrix remodeling and thereby provide atypical biochemical and biomechanical signals to epithelial cells. Previous work has been focused on the cellular and molecular phenotype as well as on matrix stiffness and remodeling, providing potential targets for cancer therapeutics. So far, biomechanical changes in CAFs and adjacent epithelial cells of the prostate have not been explored. Here, we compared the mechanical properties of primary prostatic CAFs and patient-matched non-malignant prostate tissue fibroblasts (NPFs) using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and real-time deformability cytometry (RT-FDC). It was found that CAFs exhibit an increased apparent Young's modulus, coinciding with an altered architecture of the cytoskeleton compared with NPFs. In contrast, co-cultures of benign prostate epithelial (BPH-1) cells with CAFs resulted in a decreased stiffness of the epithelial cells, as well as an elongated morphological phenotype, when compared with co-cultures with NPFs. Moreover, the presence of CAFs increased proliferation and invasion of epithelial cells, features typically associated with tumor progression. Altogether, this study provides novel insights into the mechanical interactions between epithelial cells with the malignant prostate microenvironment, which could potentially be explored for new diagnostic approaches.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2590006420300338;0;0;0.5;S2590006420300338;;100073;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2590006420300338;;

PrEP could fill an important HIV prevention gap, especially for sexually active young women who are limited in their ability to negotiate mutual monogamy or condom use. As PrEP is scaled up in high HIV incidence settings, it is crucial to consider the importance of early identification of HIV infection during PrEP use, to allow for rapid discontinuation of PrEP to reduce the risk of antiretroviral (ARV) resistance. The purpose of this case study is to provide this critical evidence. Case presentation: This report describes a 20-year-old woman in a HIV sero-discordant relationship who initiated oral PrEP (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC)) through a demonstration project (CAPRISA 084) in October 2017. Despite good adherence throughout her PrEP use, she tested HIV antibody positive at month nine of study participation. Retrospective testing showed increasing HIV viral load over time, and retrospective use of fourth-generation rapid HIV tests showed HIV detection (positive antigen/antibody) at month one. Sequencing confirmed a dominant wild type at month one with dual therapy resistance patterns emerging by month three (M184V and K65R mutations), which is suggestive of protracted PrEP use during an undetected HIV infection. The participant was referred to infectious diseases for further management of her HIV infection and was initiated on a first line, tenofovir-sparing regimen. At the time of this report (January 2020), the participant had been on ARV- therapy (ART) for 13 months and had no signs of either clinical, immunologic or virologic failure. Conclusions: This case report highlights the importance of appropriate HIV screening during wider oral PrEP scale-up in high HIV incidence settings to circumvent the consequences of prolonged dual therapy in an undiagnosed HIV infection and in turn prevent ARV resistance.;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05255-5;4.5;4.3;4.1;;32698772;532;;;

They can also occur extranodally. Extranodal FDC sarcomas most commonly present as solitary masses. Inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT)-like FDC sarcomas, a subcategory of FDC sarcomas, are rarer than other sarcoma subtypes. They are composed of spindle or ovoid neoplastic cells and exhibit an admixture of plasma cells and prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltration. Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP), also known as paraneoplastic autoimmune multiorgan syndrome, is a rare autoimmune bullous disease that is associated with underlying neoplasms. PNP has a high mortality, and its early diagnosis is usually difficult. CASE SUMMARY We describe a 27-year-old woman who presented with stomatitis, conjunctivitis, and skin blisters and erosions as her first symptoms of PNP with an intraabdominal IPT-like FDC sarcoma. The patient underwent surgical tumor resection and received tapering oral corticosteroid treatment. She showed no recurrence at the 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSION IPT-like FDC sarcomas are rare underlying neoplasms that have an uncommon association with PNP. PNP-associated FDC sarcomas predominantly occur in intra-abdominal sites and suggest a poor prognosis. Surgical resection is an essential and effective treatment for PNP and primary and recurrent FDC sarcomas.;https://www.wjgnet.com/2307-8960/full/v8/i14/3097.htm;0;0.0;0.3;;;;;;

Methods: We performed a descriptive analysis of demographic and clinical data of HIV/TB coinfected patients receiving ART at Beijing Ditan Hospital between January 2014 and October 2018. Results: Of 199 patients included, 45 (22.6%) developed paradoxical TB-IRIS, and 19 (9.5%) TB-IRIS cases presented miliary TB. The pre-ART CD4 count lower than 50 cells/mm3 was found to be significantly associated with development of TB-IRIS. Similarly, patients with higher than 4-fold increase in CD4 cell count after antiretroviral therapy (ART) had significantly higher odds of having TB-IRIS. When patients aged 25-44 years were utilized as the control group, youths (< 25 years old) were more likely to have miliary TB. No significant difference was observed in the intervals from initiation of ART to IRIS presentation between miliary and non-miliary group. Conclusions: In conclusion, our data demonstrate that approximate one quarter of patients coinfected with TB and HIV develop paradoxical TB-IRIS after initial of ART therapy in China.

Main body: Tiotropium bromide was the first LAMA available for COPD in clinical practice and, because of its long duration of action, is administered once daily. Tiotropium was initially available as an inhalation powder delivered via a dry-powder inhaler (DPI). Later, tiotropium also became available as an inhalation spray delivered via a soft mist inhaler (SMI). The SMI was designed to overcome or minimize some of the issues associated with other inhaler types (eg, the need for strong inspiratory airflow with DPIs). Results of short- and long-term randomized, controlled clinical trials of tiotropium in patients with COPD indicated tiotropium was safe and significantly improved lung function, health-related quality of life, and exercise endurance, and reduced dyspnea, lung hyperinflation, exacerbations, and use of rescue medication compared with placebo or active comparators. These positive efficacy findings triggered the evaluation of tiotropium in fixed-dose combination with olodaterol (a long-acting 2-agonist). In this review, we provide an overview of studies of tiotropium for the treatment of COPD, with a focus on pivotal studies. Conclusion: Tiotropium is safe and efficacious as a long-term, once-daily LAMA for the maintenance treatment of COPD and for reducing COPD exacerbations. The SMI generates a low-velocity, long-duration aerosol spray with a high fine-particle fraction, which results in marked lung drug deposition. In addition, high inspiratory flow rates are not required.;https://respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12931-020-01407-y;6.3;5.3;5.3;;32727455;199;;;

We conducted a phase Ib study to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of fluorouracil, l-leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) plus ramucirumab. Methods: This phase Ib study investigated three dose levels of FOLFOXIRI plus ramucirumab (three dose levels of irinotecan and fluorouracil with fixed dose of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 and ramucirumab 8 mg/kg on day 1, repeated every 2 weeks) in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was assessed during the first cycle. Results: A total of ten patients were enrolled. The first four patients received the treatment at dose level 0 (irinotecan 150 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2), and subsequent six patients were treated at dose level 1 (irinotecan 165 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 3200 mg/m2). No DLT was observed in the nine DLT-evaluable patients, which indicated that the RP2D was dose level 1. Grade 3 or worse adverse events included neutropenia (70%), hypertension (20%), and febrile neutropenia (10%). No treatment-related death was observed in any cycle. The overall response rate was 70%. Conclusion: The RP2D of FOLFOXIRI plus ramucirumab was determined to be 8 mg/kg of ramucirumab, 165 mg/m2 of irinotecan, 85 mg/m2 of oxaliplatin, 200 mg/m2 of l-leucovorin, and 3200 mg/m2 of fluorouracil.

Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background: Gemcitabine (GEM) plus nab-paclitaxel (NabP) (GEM 1000 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes + NabP 125 mg/m2 IV given days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days) is one of the two standard of care combination therapies for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Our cancer center has utilized GEM-NabP given every two-weeks due to tolerability and patient convenience. Here, we review the safety and efficacy of this modified regimen. Methods: Metastatic PDAC patients (pts) who initiated front-line or second-line GEM-NabP during 2013-2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Primary objective was overall survival. Secondary objectives were disease control rate, progression-free survival, and the incidence of dose delays and/or adjustments. Results: From a total of 235 patients, 140 pts received GEM-NabP front-line while 95 pts received GEM-NabP second-line. Median dosing was 600 mg/m2 at fixed-dose rate for GEM and 125 mg/m2 for NabP given predominantly (~90%) every two-weeks. Eastern Cooperative Group performance status of 0 and 1 pts had front-line OS of 12.7 and 9.6 months and when given second-line had OS of 8 months and 7.3 months, respectively. ECOG 0 and 1 pts had front-line progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.3 months and 2.8 months and second-line PFS was 3.5 months and 2.4 months, respectively. Treatment was well tolerated with limited dose modifications. Conclusion: Our analysis revealed safety with every two-week low dose GEM-NabP while maintaining efficacy. Patient schedule convenience should factor into metastatic incurable malignancies. We suggest the use of every two-week GEM-NabP particularly in patients desiring a modified schedule.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cam4.3229;4.9;4.5;4.6;;32519420;;;;

For the management of asthma, the fixed-dose combination of a long-acting 2-agonist (LABA) and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) has been recommended by Global Initiative for Asthma guideline as a preferred treatment option for patients who are uncontrolled with only ICS doses. One of the available LABA/ICS combinations is the formoterol/budesonide (FB). Areas covered: This article systematically reviews the efficacy and safety of the FB pMDI compared with the FB dry powder inhaler (DPI), individual mono-components (formoterol and budesonide) or salmeterol/fluticasone (SF) combination in the treatment of asthma among paediatric and adult patients. PubMed was searched with the string: ‘‘((Budesonide) AND Formoterol) AND ((((pMDI) OR MDI) OR Pressurised Metered-dose inhaler) OR Metered-dose inhaler)’’, in ALL fields. Screening of all the articles was done till February 2020. We have included 24 articles from the total of 142 hits received. Conclusions: The FB pMDI is efficacious for the long-term management of asthma in patients 6 years of age and above. It has been shown to improve lung function and asthma control, and to reduce daytime and night-time symptoms, the number of rescue medication doses and asthma exacerbations. It also showed rapid onset of bronchodilatory effect with a dose–response relationship that allows patients to utilise it as a Single Maintenance And Reliever Therapy (SMART) regimen.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0954611120301955;5.9;5.4;5.5;S0954611120301955;32843176;106055;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0954611120301955;;

Percentile flows of the FDC express the percent of time a flow is equaled or exceeded, and often need to be predicted for ungauged basins. Regression models are commonly used to predict percentile flows. However, a major challenge of this approach is selecting basin characteristics to serve as independent variables. The number of basin characteristics precludes an analysis of all possible models. Thus, a subset of models are typically evaluated using an automated regression procedure, like stepwise regression or the more exhaustive branch-and-bound approach. The latter was used as a baseline approach in this study, and was compared to six other less commonly used methods from the field of variable (feature) selection. The performance of all seven approaches was evaluated based on percentile flow regression models developed for a large sample of 918 basins in the United States. The baseline regression procedure only outperformed principal component analysis, the only method that did not use the percentile flows to select variables. Of the variable selection methods that used the percentile flows, the regression procedure performed the worst. This suggests that regression procedures should not be the first choice among variable selection methods for developing percentile flow regression models. Variables selected based on knowledge of the FDC performed nearly as well as the best overall data-based method (i.e. random forests). Random forests, and other methods that performed well, emphasized the influence of geology on percentile flows. A geologic variable (i.e. baseflow index) had the largest effect on predictive performance. All of the models suffered from large predictive error, and future work should apply a regional approach that groups similar basins to predict percentile flows.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022169420304352;6.8;7.2;7.2;S0022169420304352;;124975;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0022169420304352;;

Patients had psoriasis classified as at least 'mild' per PGA. NCT01536938 enrolled adult patients (18 years) randomized 1:1:1 to once-daily (QD) Cal/BD foam (Cal 0.005%, BD 0.064%), Cal foam (0.005%) or BD foam (0.064%). NCT02387853 enrolled adolescent patients (12- <17 years) to Cal/BD foam QD (dose as previously). Treatment success was based on improvement in PGA classification at week 4. Additional efficacy endpoints included mPASI in adults and effect on extent of scalp surface area (SSA) in adolescents. Safety was also assessed. Overall, 302 adults (n=100 Cal/BD foam; n=101 Cal foam; n=101 BD foam) and 106 adolescents received treatment. Treatment success in adults was significantly higher with Cal/BD vs Cal foam (53.0% vs 35.6%, P=0.021) and numerically higher than with BD foam (47.5%, P=0.45). Mean percentage changes in mPASI were -80.0%, -57.8% and -71.2%, for Cal/BD, Cal and BD foam, respectively. In adolescents, 73.6% of patients treated with Cal/BD foam achieved treatment success and mean SSA fell from 50.6% at baseline to 12.5% at week 4. All treatment-related AEs were considered mild-to-moderate across both studies, except one severe AE (hypersensitivity reaction with urticaria) in the adult Cal/BD foam group, which led to withdrawal from the study. In these studies, treatment of scalp psoriasis with Cal/BD foam provided good efficacy for adults and adolescents and was generally well tolerated.

Transient overvoltage due to transmission line switching, particularly in series and shunt compensated power systems, is one of the most important issues that increases the exposure level of the CCVT to FP. A probabilistic study focused on the impact of transient overvoltages on the FP in CCVT is conducted in this article. Through this framework, the behavior of different types of ferroresonance damping circuits (FDCs) is investigated. By investigating the effect of several factors such as switching instance and different fault types in the presence of series and shunt compensation in the power system, the probability density function of the CCVT primary (bus voltage) and secondary (CCVT output) voltage signals with/without different FDCs is obtained. A criterion based on total harmonic distortion, designed to identify and determine the severity of the FP, is also introduced. Simulation results confirm that overvoltages in a series and shunt compensated power system will enhance the vulnerability of the CCVT against FP.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8890840/;12.5;10.0;13.9;;;8890840;;;

These inflammatory states cause damage in the sidewalls of the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in malabsorption of food and vitamins. Folic acid (Vitamin B9) is often associated with inflammatory bowel diseases since reduced overall folate concentration in the human body may lead to the development of colorectal cancer and megaloblastic anaemia. However, its deficiency is easily compensated by taking an additional folic acid pill during regular therapy. At the moment, there are no studies that have examined the compatibility of folic acid with 5-aminosalicylate drugs used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. In this work, differential scanning calorimetry, forced degradation studies, isothermal stress testing and dissolution stability testing were used to determine the stability of folic acid and one of the most commonly used 5-aminosalicylates, mesalazine, when present in the same solution or blend. To monitor the assay of folic acid, mesalazine and nine of its related impurities, a single HPLC method was developed. Results of compatibility studies showed that no physicochemical interaction between mesalazine and folic acid occurs when combined, opening the path to the development of new formulations, such as a mesalazine/folic acid fixed-dose combination.;https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/13/8/187;6.1;5.0;5.4;;;187;;;

However, simulations driven by GCM data cannot be directly evaluated using observed flows, and the confidence in the results can be relatively low. The objectives of this paper were to bias correct simulated stream flows from calibrated hydrologic models for two basins in New Jersey, USA, and evaluate model performance in comparison to uncorrected simulations. Then, we used stream flow bias correction and flow duration curves (FDCs) to evaluate and assess simulations driven by statistically downscaled GCMs for the historical period and the future time slices 2041-2070 and 2071-2099. Bias correction of stream flow from simulations increased confidence in the performance of two previously calibrated hydrologic models. Results indicated there was no difference in projected FDCs for uncorrected and bias-corrected flows in one basin, while this was not the case in the second basin. This result provided greater confidence in projected stream flow changes in the former basin and implied more uncertainty in projected stream flows in the latter. Applications in water resources can use the methods described to evaluate the performance of GCM-driven simulations and assess the potential impacts of climate change with an appropriate level of confidence in the model results.;https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/12/8/2312;2.4;2.6;3.0;;;2312;;;

Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: Genotype 1b is the most common HCV genotype worldwide, accounting for the largest proportion of infections in Europe, Russia, Latin America and Asia. Reducing treatment duration can improve adherence, reduce drug exposure and cost. Accordingly, we evaluated the efficacy of 8 weeks fixed-dose combination of grazoprevir-elbasvir in treatment-naïve patients, with non-severe fibrosis. Methods: HCV mono-infected and treatment naïve patients with non-severe fibrosis (Fibroscan®<9.5 kPa and Fibrotest® < 0.59) were enrolled in a study which included 117 patients. Genotyping by sequencing identified five patients with non-1b genotype (two GT1a, one GT1h, one GT1e and one GT1l). Thus, we included in the final analysis 112 GT1b patients. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with HCVRNA below the lower limit of quantification 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12). Findings: Mean age was 54 ± 13 years, 31% were men and viral load was higher than 800.000 IU/mL in 70 of 112 patients (63%). Using Fibroscan®, 100 had F0-1 fibrosis score. FIB-4 lower than 1.45 and APRI less than 1 was found in 74/112 (66%) and 107/112 (95%) patients respectively. Relapse occurred in three patients by week 12. These three patients had a viral load higher than 6 million IU/mL and NS5A Y93H RAS (resistance-associated substitution). Then, modified intention-to-treat SVR12 for patients with genotype 1b was 109/112 (97%). By week 24; five relapses were observed and all had the Y93H RAS at relapse. SVR12 was achieved in 100% of patients with a baseline viral load below 6 million and decreased to 98% (98/100) by follow-up week 24. Interpretation: Naïve patients with genotype 1b and non-severe fibrosis can achieve an SVR12 of 97% and an SVR24 of 95%. Then, these patients can be treated with grazoprevir-elbasvir for 8 weeks.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/liv.14502;8.5;9.3;9.0;;32383275;;;;

Therefore, we performed this systematic review to explore the relationship between the FL microenvironment and prognosis. Methods: Relevant studies were identified from PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. Twenty-three trials involving 3336 patients with FL were included for analysis. Results: This meta-analysis confirmed the unfavorable prognostic role of high CD21+/CD23+ FDC density in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). CD8+ or granzyme B+ TILs instead of CD4+ TILs are indicators for good OS. FoxP3+ Treg cells was not associated with prognosis, and even in subgroup analysis neither the number of cells nor the infiltration pattern had predictive value. A high degree of CD68+ macrophage infiltration was a negative prognostic factor for OS, but was associated with good prognosis in the rituximab-era subgroup. Although there was no correlation between PD1-positive immune cells and prognosis, subtypes with the follicular helper T (TFH) or exhausted T cell (TEX) phenotype tended to influence prognosis. The HR in the short time to transformation (TTT) analyses suggested that high CD68+ LAM numbers, diffuse pattern of FOXP3+ Treg cells and PD1+ cells, and high PD-L1 cell numbers are adverse factors leading to early transformation. Conclusions: Multiple tissue-infiltrating immune cells in microenvironment play critical and different roles in FL prognosis.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567576920312583;5.5;5.6;5.1;S1567576920312583;32540726;106684;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1567576920312583;;

Numbers in this age group are increasing and are expected to place a greater strain on existing resources. Objectives: To describe the demographic features and the co-morbidities of OPLWH in Tlokwe. This included an assessment of viral load (VL) suppression and the identification of associations between patient characteristics and clinical outcomes. Methods: A retrospective file review was undertaken to cover the period 01 May 2017 to 30 April 2018. Descriptive statistics were applied to demographic and clinical data and to treatment outcomes. Statistically significant associations were subjected to logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the 191 participants, 111/191 (58.1%) were female and 167/191 (87.4%) were 60-70 years of age. Of the participants, 154/191 (81.9%) were virally suppressed (< 400 copies/mL). Hypertension (n = 106/191, 55.5%) was the most frequently identified co-morbidity. A CD4 cell count of  350 cells/mm3 at last assessment correlated positively with VL suppression (odds ratio 2.3, confidence interval 1.05-5.02, p = 0.037). Conclusion: Although the level of VL suppression in this cohort was high, greater effort is required to bring this in line with the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) recommendations viz. 90% viral suppression in PLWH by 2030. Further research is needed to define the evolving long-term needs of OPLWH and to facilitate entry into care of those currently not in care.;http://www.sajhivmed.org.za/index.php/HIVMED/article/view/1066;1.6;1.2;1.3;;;a1066;;;

Fe3O4@dopa@CuL (FDC) was synthesized using a four-step procedure: (i) synthesis of a dihydrazone derivative, (ii) reaction of the dihydrazone derivative with copper perchlorate salt to generate a copper complex of the dihydrazone derivative, (iii) immobilization of the complex onto Fe3O4@dopa to generate FDC, and (iv) coating of FDC with surfactant Triton X-100. The as-synthesized homogeneous complex was well characterized using UV–Vis., Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry, and single-crystalX-ray techniques. Single-crystalX-ray analysis revealed the tetranuclear framework of the complex. The heterogeneous nanoparticles (FDCTX) were characterized using FT-IR, powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersiveX-ray spectroscopy, magnetic hysteresis, and dynamic light scattering techniques. Finally, both the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts were utilized for efficient oxidation of alcohols, alkanes, and sulfides and epoxidation of alkenes. A most probable mechanism for the oxidation reaction is proposed at the end of the article.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aoc.5695;3.4;3.0;3.6;;;e5695;;;

Only rare cases of resistance to DTG have been reported when it is used as a component of antiretroviral therapy regimens in treatment-experienced patients unless there was prior use of a first-generation integrase inhibitor. Patient presentation: A 38-year-old woman diagnosed with tuberculosis was switched to a second-line antiretroviral regimen of zidovudine, lamivudine and dolutegravir 50 mg 12-hourly together with rifampicin-based TB treatment. Based on treatment history and a previous resistance test there was resistance to lamivudine but full susceptibility to zidovudine. The patient did not suppress her viral load on this regimen and later admitted to only taking dolutegravir 50 mg in the morning because of insomnia. Management and outcome: A second resistance test was performed which showed intermediate level of resistance to dolutegravir. Her regimen was changed to tenofovir, emtricitabine and ritonavir-boosted atazanavir with rifabutin replacing rifampicin for the remainder of her TB treatment. She achieved viral suppression on this regimen. Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the first case report from South Africa of emergent dolutegravir resistance in a treatment-experienced, integrase inhibitor-naive patient. Factors that may have contributed to resistance emergence in this patient were that there was only one fully active nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor in the regimen and lower exposure to dolutegravir because of the reduced dosing frequency while on rifampicin.;http://www.sajhivmed.org.za/index.php/HIVMED/article/view/1062;1.6;1.2;1.3;;;a1062;;;

Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly improved AIDS-associated morbidity, but has limitations of adverse effects, frequent dosing regimen leading to medical non-adherence. Drug delivery systems that target HIV reservoirs could potentially reduce dose-dependent toxicity and the duration of treatment. The major cellular HIV reservoirs are macrophages and CD4+ T cells with macrophages being responsible for carrying and spreading the virus. The crucial involvement of macrophages in the pathogenesis of HIV infection has led to development of macrophage targeted nanocarrier delivery systems. Areas covered: Eradication of viral reservoirs like HIV-infected macrophages has emerged to be a fundamental barrier and challenge for complete eradication of HIV from the immune system. Literature reports several macrophage targeted nanocarrier delivery systems developed as either functionalized or non-functionalized formulations such as liposomes, ethosomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and solid lipid nanoparticles showcasing superior efficacy over the conventional antiretroviral delivery systems. Expert opinion: The development of fixed dose combination of antiretroviral drugs into macrophage targeted delivery systems should factor in the inherent plasticity and heterogeneity of macrophages that is dependent on their microenvironment. A rational selection of nanocarriers will facilitate selectivity and enhanced efficacy of antiretroviral drugs accompanied by reduced dosing and toxicity. Such macrophage targeted delivery systems would positively impact the therapeutic outcomes in the management of HIV infection.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17425247.2020.1762565;9.9;10.1;9.4;;32347124;;;;

Despite the availability of various antihypertensive agents, hypertension is still poorly controlled. Therefore, new chemical compounds with antihypertensive efficacy need to be developed. The dual angiotensin II receptor-neprilysin inhibitor LCZ696 is a single molecule synthesized by co-crystallization of valsartan and the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug sacubitril (1:1 molar ratio). Areas covered: This review includes an overview of hypertension and the current pharmacotherapy. The authors summarize the LCZ696 drug chemistry, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, randomized control trials (RCTs), and safety concerns. Databases searched included PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Expert opinion: LCZ696 is effective in hypertension treatment. Short-term RCTs have shown that the highest doses of LCZ696 (200 and 400 mg [q.d.]) were more effective at lowering office and ambulatory blood pressure than angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) alone while having a similar tolerability profile. The effects of LCZ696 on hypertensive organ damage are only sparsely investigated and so far no studies have established the impact of LCZ696 on cardiovascular event rates. Future studies should focus on the comparison of LCZ696 and combination therapies already in use such as ARB and calcium channel blockers.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14656566.2020.1735356;5.7;5.6;4.9;;32133873;;;;

As a result, HIV-positive patients with diabetes were initially excluded from beta cell replacement therapy. Early reports of pancreas transplant in patients with HIV described high rates of early graft loss with limited follow-up. We report long-term follow-up of islet or pancreas transplantation in HIV-positive type 1 diabetic patients who received a kidney transplant concurrently or had previously undergone kidney transplantation. Although 4 patients developed polyoma viremia, highly active antiretroviral therapy and adequate infectious prophylaxis were successful in providing protection until CD4+ counts recovered. Coordination with HIV providers is critical to reduce the risk of rejection by minimizing drug-drug interactions. Also, protocols for prophylaxis of opportunistic infections and strategies for monitoring and treating BK viremia are important given the degree of immunosuppression required. This series demonstrates that type 1 diabetic patients with well-controlled HIV and renal failure can be appropriate candidates for beta cell replacement, with a low rate of infectious complications, early graft loss, and rejection, so excellent long-term graft survival is possible. Additionally, patients with HIV and cardiovascular contraindications can undergo islet infusion.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajt.15796;10.0;10.8;11.1;;31994295;;;;

Understanding the prevalence and patterns of HIVDR in this population (15-24 years) will contribute to defining effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, improving clinical decision making, and supporting behavioral change interventions needed to achieve HIV epidemic control. Methods A cross-sectional analysis of study enrollment data from the Project YES! Youth Engaging for Success randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants were 15 to 24 years old, who knew their HIV status, and had been on ART for at least 6 months. All participants completed a survey and underwent viral load (VL) testing. Participants with viral failure (VL 1,000 copies/mL) underwent HIVDR testing which included analysis of mutations in the protease and reverse transcriptase genes. Results A total of 99 out of 273 analyzed participants receiving ART had VL failure, of whom 77 had successful HIVDR amplification and analysis. Out of the 77, 75% (58) had at least one drug resistant mutation, among which 83% (48/58) required a drug change. Among the 58 with HIVDR mutations, the prevalence of at least one HIVDR mutation to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) were 81%, 65.5% and 1.7%. The mutation M184V which confers resistance to NRTI drugs of lamivudine (3TC) and emtricitabine (FTC) was the most common (81%) among NRTI associated mutations followed by K65R (34.5%) which is associated with both tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) resistance. Thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs) which confer resistance primarily to zidovudine (AZT), stavudine (d4T) and other NRTIs were observed at 32.8%. Common TAMs were K70RTQNE (32.8%), K219QE (22.4%), D67N (17.2%) and T215IT (15.5%). The most common NNRTI associated mutation was the K103N (65.5%) which confers resistance to both efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP). There was a relatively high occurrence of other NNRTI mutations V106A (36.2%), as well as Y188C (36.2%) and Y181C (36.2%) which confer resistance to etravirine. Conclusions There is a high prevalence of HIVDR including TAMs despite majority of these patients (90.48%) being on AZT or d4T sparing first line ART among the youth. Emergence of these mutations including the NNRTI associated mutations (Y181C and Y188C) may compromise future second- and third-line regimens in the absence of routine HIVDR testing. HIVDR monitoring at start of ART or at first-line failure can better inform clinical decision making and ART programing.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236156;5.7;5.4;5.2;;32804970;e0236156;;;

Process management systems mainly consist of statistical process control (SPC), fault detection and classification (FDC), and advanced process control (APC), and are modeled using time series data. However, large amounts of time series data and various distributions are collected in the process; hence, preprocessing measures, such as length adjustment, are essential for modeling. Dynamic time warping (DTW) has been widely used as an algorithm that can measure the similarity between two different time series data and adjust their length. However, owing to the complex structure and time lag of processing time series data, there are limitations in applying the traditional DTW. Therefore, to solve this problem, we propose the shape segment dynamic time warping (SSDTW) algorithm that improves DTW in consideration of the structure information of time series data. By using the maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT), the proposed method reflects the peripheral information of the time series data and divides the time series data interval to achieve a reasonable local alignment path. SSDTW attains more accurate alignment paths than DTW, derivative dynamic time warping (DDTW), and shapeDTW. Experiments conducted using semiconductor signal data and UCR time series data sets show that the proposed method is more effective than DTW, DDTW, and shapeDTW.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0957417420301160;9.5;10.2;11.0;S0957417420301160;;113291;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0957417420301160;;

Adherence to the ART is a crucial challenge to be addressed as it plays a major role in the success of HIV management. Aim: To determine the prescribing pattern of antiretroviral drugs uses at an ART center and the levels of adherence to the drugs and the associated adverse effects. Materials and methods: It is a retrospective analysis of the clinical records related to HIV-infected adults who were receiving treatment at an ART Center in Andhra Pradesh state. The main outcomes of the study are demographic details of the patients, the pattern of ART combinations prescribed, adherence to the given ART, and analysis of reported ADRs. Simple descriptive statistics and chi-square tests are the statistics used to measure the outcomes. Results: A total of 430 HIV patients' records were selected and assessed. Tenofovir (TAF) + Lamivudine (3TC) +Efavirenz (EFV) (66.5%) were the most prescribed ARV combination. The majority of 348 patients (80.9%) was good adherence and showed a significant association with therapeutic outcomes. The most common clinical ADRs found in this study were gastrointestinal disturbances (30.9%) followed by dermatological problems (20.4 %). Conclusion: Despite drug toxicity, ART treatment bears potential therapeutic efficacy and is considered as the only means to increase life expectancy in HIV infected patients. Detailed patient counseling and monitoring improve therapeutic outcomes and patients adherence.;None;0.4;0.4;0.4;;;;;;

There are few data available from African cohorts demonstrating the effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on coagulation biomarkers. Methods: From March 2014 to October 2014, ART-naïve PLHIV initiating non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART were recruited from seven clinics in western Kenya and followed for up to 12 months. Demographics, clinical history and blood specimens were collected. Logistic regression models adjusted for intrasite clustering examined associations between HIV viral load and D-Dimer at baseline. Mixed linear effects models were used to estimate mean change from baseline to 6 months overall, and by baseline viral load, sex and TB status at enrollment. Mean change in D-dimer at 6 months is reported on the log10 scale and as percentage change from baseline. Results: Among 611 PLHIV enrolled, 66% were female, median age was 34 years (interquartile range (IQR) 29-43 years), 31 (5%) participants had tuberculosis and median viral load was 113,500 copies/mL (IQR: 23,600-399,000). At baseline, 311 (50.9%) PLHIV had elevated D-dimer (> 500 ng/mL) and median D-dimer was 516.4 ng/mL (IQR: 302.7-926.6) (log baseline D-dimer: 2.7, IQR: 2.5-3.0). Higher baseline D-dimer was significantly associated with higher viral load (p < 0.0001), female sex (p = 0.02) and tuberculosis (p = 0.02). After 6 months on ART, 518 (84.8%) PLHIV had achieved viral load < 1000 copies/mL and median D-dimer was 390.0 (IQR: 236.6-656.9) (log D-dimer: 2.6, IQR: 2.4-2.8). Mean change in log D-dimer from baseline to 6 months was - 0.12 (95%CI -0.15, - 0.09) (p < 0.0001) indicating at 31.3% decline (95%CI -40.0, - 23.0) in D-dimer levels over the first 6 months on ART. D-dimer decline after ART initiation was significantly greater among PLHIV with tuberculosis at treatment initiation (- 172.1, 95%CI -259.0, - 106.3; p < 0.0001) and those with log viral load > 6.0 copies/mL (- 91.1, 95%CI -136.7, - 54.2; p < 0.01). Conclusions: In this large Kenyan cohort of PLHIV, women, those with tuberculosis and higher viral load had elevated baseline D-dimer. ART initiation and viral load suppression among ART-naïve PLHIV in Kenya were associated with significant decrease in D-dimer at 6 months in this large African cohort.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05213-1;4.5;4.3;4.1;;32664854;508;;;

A nationwide cross-sectional internet-based survey was conducted among the 41,800 French dentists. The online questionnaire was distributed through professional networks from April 2017 to April 2018. Seven-hundred seventy-five dentists participated but only 455 questionnaires were complete enough to be included in the analyses. Amoxicillin was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic (65.8%, 1783/2711), followed by spiramycin + metronidazole fixed-dose combination (11.6%, 312/2711) and amoxicillin–clavulanic acid (10.3%, 279/2711). The main indications for use were abscess (349/423, 82.5%), cervicofacial cellulitis (74.2%, 314/423), and pericoronitis (58.6%, 239/408). Most dentists (90.5%, 381/421) considered that antibiotic resistance is of concern but only half of them (56.3%, 238/423) felt adequately informed about antibiotic use. Many dentists did not comply with the national guidelines: the majority of them declared inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for 11/17 clinical situations. They did not prescribe antibiotics for 5/6 clinical situations requiring prophylaxis. They reported that the publication of clinical guidelines is the main factor influencing their prescriptions (71.0%, 299/421). They wished to receive regular updates of national guidelines in the form of practical sheets (93.0%, 172/185). French dentists should urgently be targeted by antibiotic stewardship initiatives.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10096-020-03849-0;5.2;4.5;4.6;;32062724;;;;

The study primary objective is to investigate factors associated with faster initial HIV RNA half-life decay when combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) is initiated in pregnancy. Methods: This was a multicentre, retrospective, observational study, conducted in south England, United Kingdom, between August 2001 and February 2018. Data were extracted from case notes of eligible women initiating cART during the index pregnancy. Anonymised data were collated and analysed centrally. Regression analyses were conducted to determine factors associated with faster HIV RNA half-life decay in the first 14 days after commencing cART (first-phase), and with achieving an undetectable maternal pVL by 36 weeks' gestation. We then assessed whether HIV- and obstetric- related parameters differed by antiretroviral third agent class and whether the proportions of women with undetectable pVL at 36 weeks' gestation and at delivery differed by antiretroviral third agent class. Results: Baseline pVL was the only independent factor associated with faster first-phase HIV RNA half-life decay on commencing cART. Lower pVL on day 14 after starting cART was associated with an increased likelihood of achieving an undetectable pVL by 36 weeks' gestation. Integrase inhibitor-based cART was associated with a faster first-phase HIV RNA half-life decay on commencing cART. Overall, 73% and 85% of women had an undetectable pVL at 36 weeks' gestation and at delivery respectively, with no significant difference by antiretroviral third agent class. Conclusions: Only high baseline pVL independently contributed to a faster rate of first-phase viral half-life decay. pVL at 14 days after initiating cART allows early identification of treatment failure. In the first 14 days after initiating cART in pregnancy, integrase inhibitor-based cART reduced maternal pVL faster than protease inhibitor- and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase-based cART. While our study findings support INSTI use when initiated in pregnancy especially when initiated at later gestations and in those with higher baseline pVL, other non-INSTI based cART with more data on safety in pregnancy also performed well.;https://aidsrestherapy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12981-020-00297-w;3.2;3.8;4.4;;32660502;41;;;

Published by BMJ.Introduction Despite the consistent evidence of the benefits of physical activity on preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) and some cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia, the prescription of drugs remains the most widely used approach to prevent ASCVD in clinical settings. The purpose of this study protocol is to provide a meta-synthesis methodology for comparing the effect of fixed-dose combination therapy and physical exercise on controlling cardiovascular risk factors and preventing ASCVD. Methods and analysis This protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols and the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. We plan to conduct a computerised search in Medline, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and SPORTDiscus from inception to May 2020 for studies testing the effectiveness of physical exercise or fixed-dose combination drug therapy in preventing ASCVD, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and controlling some cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension and dyslipidaemia). Since performing network meta-analyses (NMA) is a statistical approach that allows direct and indirect comparisons of interventions, where sufficient studies are included, we plan to perform the following NMA comparing the effect of fixed-dose combination therapy and physical exercise interventions on (1) improving lipid profile, (2) reducing blood pressure, (3) preventing cardiovascular events and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and (4) improving compliance with the therapeutic strategy and reducing adverse events. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval will not be needed because data included in the NMA will be extracted from published trials that meet accepted ethical standards. The results will be published in academic peer-reviewed journals, and the evidence gathered by this project could be included in the preventive cardiovascular disease guidelines.;https://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036734;3.7;3.6;3.5;;32641333;e036734;;;

Methods: All newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases at Beijing YouAn Hospital from January 2012 to December 2013 were selected as the control group, while all newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients from January 2015 to December 2016 were selected as the intervention group, receiving the comprehensive case management model. Results: 4906 patients were enrolled, of which 1549 were in the control group and 3357 in the intervention group. The median time from confirming HIV infection to ART initiation in the intervention group was 35 (18-133) days, much shorter than the control group (56 (26-253) days, P < 0.001). Participants in the intervention group had better ART adherence compared to those in the control group (intervention: 95.3%; control: 89.2%; p < 0.001). During the 2 years' follow-up, those receiving case management were at decreased odds of experiencing virological failure (OR: 0.27, 95%CI: 0.17-0.42, P < 0.001). Observed mortality was 0.4 deaths per 100 patient-years of follow-up for patients in the control group compared with 0.2 deaths per 100 patient-years of follow-up in the intervention group. Conclusions: People living with HIV engaged in the comprehensive case management model were more likely to initiate ART sooner and maintained better treatment compliance and improved clinical outcomes compared to those who received routine care. A comprehensive case management program could be implemented in hospitals across China in order to reduce the HIV disease burden in the country.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05219-9;4.5;4.3;4.1;;32646373;489;;;

Published by BMJ.Background Cemiplimab, a high-affinity, potent human immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody to programmed cell death-1 demonstrated antitumor activity in a Phase 1 advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) expansion cohort (NCT02383212) and the pivotal Phase 2 study (NCT02760498). Here we report the primary analysis of fixed dose cemiplimab 350 mg intravenously every 3 weeks (Q3W) (Group 3) and provide a longer-term update after the primary analysis of weight-based cemiplimab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks (Q2W) (Group 1) among metastatic CSCC (mCSCC) patients in the pivotal study (NCT02760498). Methods The primary objective for each group was objective response rate (ORR) per independent central review (ICR). Secondary endpoints included ORR by investigator review (INV), duration of response (DOR) per ICR and INV, and safety and tolerability. Results For Group 3 (n=56) and Group 1 (n=59), median follow-up was 8.1 (range, 0.6 to 14.1) and 16.5 (range, 1.1 to 26.6) months, respectively. ORR per ICR was 41.1% (95% CI, 28.1% to 55.0%) in Group 3, 49.2% (95% CI, 35.9% to 62.5%) in Group 1, and 45.2% (95% CI, 35.9% to 54.8%) in both groups combined. Per ICR, Kaplan-Meier estimate for DOR at 8 months was 95.0% (95% CI, 69.5% to 99. 3%) in responding patients in Group 3, and at 12 months was 88.9% (95% CI, 69.3% to 96.3%) in responding patients in Group 1. Per INV, ORR was 51.8% (95% CI, 38.0% to 65.3%) in Group 3, 49.2% (95% CI, 35.9% to 62.5%) in Group 1, and 50.4% (95% CI, 41.0% to 59.9%) in both groups combined. Overall, the most common adverse events regardless of attribution were fatigue (27.0%) and diarrhea (23.5%). Conclusion In patients with mCSCC, cemiplimab 350 mg intravenously Q3W produced substantial antitumor activity with durable response and an acceptable safety profile. Follow-up data of cemiplimab 3 mg/kg intravenously Q2W demonstrate ongoing durability of responses. Trial registration number Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02760498.

This article aim to assess that difference that HIV makes on radiation treatment. Patients and methods: A retrospective cohort of all DBCL patients treated with chemotherapy and consolidative radiotherapy at a single institution between 2010 and 2018 was assessed. All patients had biopsy-proven lymphoma and were included if radiation was part of the treatment and had at least 6 months of follow-up or were followed until death. Results: Three-hundred fifty-nine (359) patients were selected, with a median age at diagnosis of 57.7 years (13-90 years). Twenty-eight patients (7.8%) were HIV positive. Median follow-up was 48.0 months. Female patients were 51.3% and most had a good performance in the ECOG scale (78.8% are ECOG 0-1). Median overall survival was not reached, but mean OS was 50.1 months with 86 deaths. Median progression-free survival was 48.7 months. HIV infection had no impact on OS (p = 0.580) or PFS (p = 0.347) among patients treated with RT. HIV positive patients were more frequently staged only with CT (p > 0.05) with no impact on PFS (p = 0.191). No HIV positive patient received rituximab due to local policy restrictions and HIV positive patients were more prone to receive CHOP-like chemotherapy (p < 0.05), specially ones with etoposide (CHOEP). CHOP was associated with better survival (p = 0.015) in the overall population and in the HIV negative population (p = 0.002), but not in the HIV positive population (p = 0.982). RT toxicities were not overall more frequent in the HIV positive population (p = 0.567), except for fatigue (p < 0.05) and hematological toxicities (p = 0.022). Conclusion: HIV status did not influence on survival when patients were treated with consolidative radiotherapy. HIV infection was a bias on our sample for staging methods and chemotherapy regimens choices. For HIV positive patients there was an increase in fatigue and hematological toxicities of any grade with radiation.;https://ro-journal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13014-020-01589-1;5.2;4.7;4.3;;32539797;153;;;

In this study interactions between butorphanol and dexmedetomidine were investigated in the thermal pain and autonomous locomotor activity. Butorphanol and dexmedetomidine were administered subcutaneously alone and in combination in a fixed-dose ratio (3:1) to assess the antinociceptive and sedative responses. Butorphanol produced antinociception in the hot-plate test via three major opioid receptor subtypes, i.e. MORs, KORs and DORs, while in the tail-immersion test the antinociception was produced by MORs and KORs, whereas dexmedetomidine exhibited antinociception by 2ARs in both tests. They exhibited dose- and time-dependent antinociception and inhibition of locomotor activity when administered alone, while their combination displayed enhanced therapeutic effects. Isobolographic analysis revealed that combined butorphanol and dexmedetomidine produced synergistic interactions in the hot-plate, tail-immersion and locomotor activity tests. Furthermore, the analgesic synergy was also approved to be modulated by MORs, KORs, DORs and 2ARs. Hence we concluded from this study that combined butorphanol and dexmedetomidine produced synergistic antinociception that may be helpful in facilitating clinical management of acute nociceptive pain.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0928098720301111;5.7;5.4;6.6;S0928098720301111;;105322;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0928098720301111;;

The planned synthesis of a mixed-linker MOF, combining TDC and FDC in the framework turned out to yield a rather largely intricate mixture of CAU-23 and MIL-160. This is due to the different opening angles of 150° for TDCversus120° for FDC and the concomitantcis-trans versus cis-only OH-bridges in the infinite secondary building unit {Al(-OH)(O2C-)} chains. At the same time, the CAU-23 phase is accompanied by the polymorphic MIL-53-TDC phase withtrans-only OH-bridges. The measurement of water vapor sorption isotherms was the method of choice to confirm the formation of mixed MOFs instead of mixed-linker phases. Thereby, the water sorption isotherms indicate the simultaneous formation of both MOF phases, albeit they do not exclude mixed-linker MOFs which may have formed at low levels of substitution. The differentiationviapowder X-ray diffractometry (PXRD), IR-spectroscopy and nitrogen sorption was either not conclusive enough or impossible, due to similarities of the neat MOF phases. The synthesized MOF mixtures within the TDC : FDC ratios of 38 : 62 up to 82 : 18 exhibit two or three uptake steps in the water sorption isotherm, with the first two corresponding to an overlay from the individual water sorption isotherm of CAU-23 and MIL-160 and a third one from the additional MIL-53-TDC.;http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=D0DT01044H;7.3;7.3;6.8;;32427259;;;;

Methods: This is an exploratory non-randomized, open-label, multinational and multicenter seamless phase I/II trial in children and adolescents with relapsed / refractory or progressive high-risk solid tumors and CNS tumors. The phase I is divided in 2 age cohorts: 12-21 years and 6-11 years and follows a 3 + 3 design with two dose levels for entinostat (2 mg/m2 and 4 mg/m2 once per week) and fixed dose nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Patients entering the trial on RP2D can seamlessly enter phase II which consists of a biomarker defined four group basket trial: high mutational load (group A), high PD-L1 mRNA expression (group B), focal MYC(N) amplification (group C), low mutational load and low PD-L1 mRNA expression and no MYC(N) amplification (group D). A Bayesian adaptive design will be used to early stop cohorts that fail to show evidence of activity. The maximum number of patients is 128. Discussion: This trial intends to exploit the immune enhancing effects of entinostat on nivolumab using an innovative biomarker driven approach in order to maximize the chance of detecting signs of activity. It prevents exposure to unnecessary risks by applying the Bayesian adaptive design for early stopping for futility. The adaptive biomarker driven design provides an innovative approach accelerating drug development and reducing exposure to investigational treatments in these vulnerable children at the same time.

Methods: We characterized a prospective cohort of adults presenting to a tertiary emergency department in Harare, Zimbabwe with suspected community-acquired sepsis using blood and urine cultures, urine tuberculosis lipoarabinomannan (TB LAM), and serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) testing. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Results: Of 142 patients enrolled 68% (n = 96/142, 95% confidence interval (CI) [60–75%]) were HIV-positive, 41% (n = 39/96, 95% CI [31–50%]) of whom were ART-naïve. Among HIV-positive patients, both opportunistic pathogens (TB LAM-positivity, 36%, 95% CI [24–48%]; CrAg-positivity, 15%, 95% CI [7–23%]) and severe non-AIDS infections (S. pneumoniae urine antigen-positivity 12%, 95% CI [4–20%]; bacteraemia 17% (n = 16/96, 95% CI [9–24%]), of which 56% (n = 9/16, 95% CI [30–80%]) were gram-negative organisms) were common. Klebsiella pneumoniae recovered from blood and urine was uniformly resistant to ceftriaxone, as were most Escherichia coli isolates. Acknowledging the power limitations of our study, we conclude that relative to HIV-negative patients, HIV-positive patients had modestly higher 30-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.88, 95% CI [0.78–4.55]; p = 0.16, and 3.59, 95% CI [1.27–10.16], p = 0.02) among those with and without viral suppression, respectively. Conclusion: Rapid point-of-care assays provide substantial clinically actionable information in the setting of suspected sepsis, even in areas with high ART coverage. Antimicrobial resistance to first-line antibiotics in high burden settings is a growing threat.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1201971220302198;5.3;5.6;5.3;S1201971220302198;32289564;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1201971220302198;;

All rights reserved.To report a case of reversible corneal endothelial abnormalities after treatment with netarsudil.Observation:A 68-year-old woman presented with the complaint of blurred vision soon after starting treatment with the fixed-dose combination of netarsudil and latanoprost (FC-netarsudil-latanoprost). She had been receiving the fixed-dose combination of dorzolamide and timolol and latanoprost for primary open-angle glaucoma until her ophthalmologist switched latanoprost to FC-netarsudil-latanoprost 2 months before referral to our center.Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20-1 in the right eye and 20/20-3 in the left eye. The slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination was remarkable for a guttata-like abnormality of the corneal endothelium of both eyes. The intraocular pressure was 10 mm Hg in both eyes. Specular microscopy revealed irregularly shaped corneal endothelial cells with indistinct borders between cells. FC-netarsudil-latanoprost was replaced with latanoprost in the left eye but continued in the right eye. Nine weeks later, best-corrected visual acuity remained 20/20-1 in the right eye but it improved to 20/20 in the left eye. Repeat specular microscopy was unchanged in the right eye and was normal in the left eye.Conclusion and Importance:Topical therapy with netarsudil can result in guttata-like changes of the corneal endothelium and corneal endothelial cell abnormalities that can be detected with specular microscopy. These abnormalities seem to be transient and resolved upon the cessation of netarsudil. Ophthalmologists should consider the possibility of a corneal endothelial abnormality in patients treated with netarsudil who develop blurred vision.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/IJG.0000000000001507;3.1;3.0;3.5;;32224803;;;;

Human Brain Mapping published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Diffusion tensor imaging is often used to assess white matter (WM) changes following traumatic brain injury (TBI), but is limited in voxels that contain multiple fibre tracts. Fixel-based analysis (FBA) addresses this limitation by using a novel method of analysing high angular resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (HARDI) data. FBA examines three aspects of each fibre tract within a voxel: tissue micro-structure (fibre density [FD]), tissue macro-structure (fibre-bundle cross section [FC]) and a combined measure of both (FD and fibre-bundle cross section [FDC]). This study used FBA to identify the location and extent of micro- and macro-structural changes in WM following TBI. A large TBI sample (Nmild = 133, Nmoderate–severe = 29) and control group (healthy and orthopaedic; N = 107) underwent magnetic resonance imaging with HARDI and completed reaction time tasks approximately 7 months after their injury (range: 98–338 days). The TBI group showed micro-structural differences (lower FD) in the corpus callosum and forceps minor, compared to controls. Subgroup analyses revealed that the mild TBI group did not differ from controls on any fixel metric, but the moderate to severe TBI group had significantly lower FD, FC and FDC in multiple WM tracts, including the corpus callosum, cerebral peduncle, internal and external capsule. The moderate to severe TBI group also had significantly slower reaction times than controls, but the mild TBI group did not. Reaction time was not related to fixel findings. Thus, the WM damage caused by moderate to severe TBI manifested as fewer axons and a reduction in the cross-sectional area of key WM tracts.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hbm.24939;9.5;8.3;7.9;;31999046;;;;

However, the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Forty patients including HIV+ SDE+ (n = 15), HIV SDE+ (n = 15) and HIV+ SDE (n = 10) subjects were enrolled in our study. All HIV+ patients were at acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) stage. Serum levels of TNF-, IFN-, IL-4, IL-13, IL-6, CXCL9, and CCL17 were quantified by ELISA. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) loads were quantified by RT-qPCR. CD4, CD8, Th1, Th2, TNF--CD8, and IFN--CD8 T cell populations were measured by flow cytometry. Levels of biochemical indexes in HIV+ SDE+ patients were significantly different from in HIV SDE+ patients (P <.05). EBV and CMV viral loads were significantly higher in HIV+ SDE+ patients, but not in HIV SDE+ patients (P <.05). Inflammatory cytokines TNF- and IFN- were significantly elevated in HIV+ SDE+ patients (P <.05). Th2/Th1 populations and TNF- secreting or IFN- secreting CD8+ T cells, were significantly up-regulated in HIV+ SDE+ patients compared to HIV SDE+ patients (P <.05). Conversely, the CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly down-regulated in HIV+ SDE+ patients compared to HIV SDE+ patients (P <.05). HIV infection confers distinct clinical phenotypes and immune inflammatory mechanisms in SDE. Sustained EBV and CMV activation, unbalanced Th2/Th1 and overactive CD8+ T cells mediating a pro-inflammatory response could act as distinct mechanisms in the aggravation of SDE in HIV+ SDE+ patients.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1440-1681.13266;3.6;3.8;4.2;;31991490;;;;

However, it was shown that a combination of protruding substrate design and applying a nonlinear field-dependent conductivity layer could address the issue. Electric filed (E) simulations were carried out according to IEC 61287-1 for the partial discharge test measurement step, where a 50/60 Hz AC voltage was applied. However, dielectrics, including ceramic substrate and silicone gel, in power devices undergo high temperatures up to a few hundred degrees and frequencies up to 1 MHz. Thus, E values obtained with electrical parameters of the mentioned dielectrics for room temperature and under 50/60 Hz may not be valid for high temperatures and frequencies mentioned above. In this paper, we address this technical gap through developing a finite element method (FEM) E calculation model developed in COMSOL Multiphysics where E calculations are carried out for different temperatures up to 250°C and frequencies up to 1 MHz. Using the model, the influence of temperature and frequency on our proposed electric field mitigation technique mentioned above is evaluated.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9158768/;0;0;0;;;9158768;;true;9781728154855

The relative efficacy of budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate metered dose inhaler 320/18/9.6 µg (BGF MDI) in COPD was compared with other ICS/LAMA/LABA fixed-dose and open combination therapies in a network meta-analysis (NMA). Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials of at least 10-week duration, including at least one fixed-dose or open combination triple therapy arm, in patients with moderate to very severe COPD. Studies were assessed for methodological quality and risk of bias. A three-level hierarchical Bayesian NMA model was used to determine the exacerbation rate per patient per year as well as the following outcomes at week 24: changes from baseline in pre-dose trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), post-dose peak FEV1, and St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score; proportion of SGRQ responders; and Transition Dyspnea Index focal score. Change from baseline in rescue medication use over weeks 12–24 was also analyzed. Meta-regression and sensitivity analyses were used to assess heterogeneity across studies. Results: Eighteen studies (n = 29,232 patients) contributed to the NMA. ICS/LABA dual combinations were combined as a single treatment group to create a connected network. Across all outcomes, there were no statistically significant differences between BGF MDI and other triple ICS/LAMA/LABA fixed-dose (fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol and beclomethasone dipropionate/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate) and open combinations with data available within the network. Results from sensitivity analyses and meta-regression were consistent with the base-case scenario. Conclusion: This NMA suggested that BGF MDI has comparable efficacy to other ICS/LAMA/LABA fixed-dose and open triple combination therapies in reducing exacerbations and improving lung function and symptoms in patients with moderate to very severe COPD. Further research is warranted as additional evidence regarding triple therapies, especially fixed-dose combinations, becomes available.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12325-020-01311-3;4.2;4.6;5.0;;32335859;;;;

Likewise, despite documented vestibular alterations in people with HIV, the true occurrence, presentation, and nature of these manifestations are yet to be established. Advances in technology for vestibular testing has allowed for objective site-of-lesion tests such as the video head impulse test (vHIT), cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMPs) and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMPs). The current study aimed to compare and describe auditory, vHIT, cVEMPs and oVEMPs findings in adults with and without HIV. Methods: The current study included an HIV positive group (n = 30) and an HIV negative group (n = 30) who underwent an auditory assessment (tympanometry and pure tone audiometry) and objective vestibular assessments. Results: The occurrence of hearing loss was 53.3% in the HIV positive group compared to 33.3% in the HIV negative group. A higher occurrence of vestibular involvement was documented in the HIV positive group (73.3%) compared to 13.3% in the HIV negative group. Conclusion: Auditory assessment and objective measures of vestibular end-organ function (vHIT and VEMPs) can be useful to detect sub-clinical alterations.

Journal of the International AIDS Society published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of the International AIDS Society.Introduction: When protease inhibitor (PI)-based second-line ART fails, guidelines recommend drug resistance testing and individualized third-line treatment. However, PI-resistant viral strains are rare and drug resistance testing is costly. We investigated whether less costly PI-exposure testing can be used to select those patients who would benefit most from drug resistance testing. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of South African adults living with HIV experiencing failure of ritonavir-boosted-lopinavir (LPV/r)-based second-line ART for whom drug resistance testing results were available. We included patients who received plasma-based drug resistance testing at a central South African reference laboratory in 2017 and patients who received dried blood spots (DBS)-based drug resistance testing at a rural South African clinic between 2009 and 2017. PI-exposure testing was performed on remnant plasma or DBS using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS). Additionally, a low-cost immunoassay was used on plasma. Population genotypic drug resistance testing of the pol region was performed on plasma and DBS using standard clinical protocols. Results: Samples from 544 patients (494 plasma samples and 50 DBS) were included. Median age was 41.0 years (IQR: 33.3 to 48.5) and 58.6% were women. Median HIV-RNA load was 4.9 log10 copies/mL (4.3 to 5.4). Prevalence of resistance to the NRTI-backbone was 70.6% (349/494) in plasma samples and 56.0% (28/50) in DBS. Major PI-resistance mutations conferring high-level resistance to LPV/r were observed in 26.7% (132/494) of plasma samples and 12% (6/50) of DBS. PI-exposure testing revealed undetectable LPV levels in 47.0% (232/494) of plasma samples and in 60.0% (30/50) of DBS. In pooled analysis of plasma and DBS samples, detectable LPV levels had a sensitivity of 90% (84% to 94%) and a negative predictive failure of 95% (91% to 97%) for the presence of major LPV/r resistance. Conclusions: PI-exposure testing revealed non-adherence in half of patients experiencing failure on second-line ART and accurately predicted the presence or absence of clinically relevant PI resistance. PI-exposure testing constitutes a novel screening strategy in patients with virological failure of ART that can differentiate between different underlying causes of therapy failure and may allow for more effective use of limited resources available for drug resistance testing.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jia2.25501;5.5;6.7;7.1;;32515898;e25501;;;

Methods: Data were collected from the records of 566 HIV-positive individuals. A retrospective cohort study design was employed. Data were entered into Epi Info 7 and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20. TB incidence density was determined per 100 person-years. Time-to-event distributions were estimated using Kaplan–Meier estimates. Survival curves and hazards across different categories were compared using log-rank tests. Determinants were identified using the Cox proportional hazards model. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed. A p-value <0.05 in the multivariate analysis was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 566 HIV-positive individuals were followed for 2140.08 person-years, giving a TB incidence density rate of 6.82/100 person-years (146, 25.8%). The highest incidence was observed within the first year of follow-up. Independent determinants were large family size (adjusted HR (AHR) 1.783, 95% CI 1.113–2.855), lower baseline CD4 (AHR 2.568, 95% CI 1.602–4.116), and baseline body mass index <18.5 kg/m2 (AHR 1.907, 95% CI 1.530–2.690).

Clopidogrel plus acetylsalicylic acid combination is the most commonly used dual antiplatelet therapy recommended by international guidelines and in Chinese clinical practice. Poor adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy or premature interruption of dual antiplatelet therapy is an important contributor to cardiovascular mortality and lethal cardiovascular events. Clopidogrel + acetylsalicylic acid fixed-dose combination enhances adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy. Herein, we aimed to evaluate bioequivalence of acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel in fixed-dose combination compared with simultaneous administration of their individual formulations in healthy Chinese subjects under fasting conditions. Methods: This was a randomized, single-center, open-label, three-sequence, three-period, two-treatment, crossover study with a washout period of 10 days conducted in healthy Chinese volunteers. Subjects were randomized to receive Co-Plavix® (test formulation- fixed-dose combination of 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 75 mg clopidogrel) once and reference formulations (coadministration of individual formulations of 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 75 mg clopidogrel) twice during the study period. Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed for acetylsalicylic acid, its metabolite salicylic acid, clopidogrel, and its metabolite SR26334. As acetylsalicylic acid shows high intrasubject variability, the reference-scaled average bioequivalence (RSABE) approach was implemented for acetylsalicylic acid analysis, while bioequivalence of clopidogrel was assessed using the average bioequivalence method. Point ratios and confidence intervals (CIs) for AUC, AUClast, and Cmax for acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel were calculated. Results: In total, 171 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Subjects were randomized and 170 subjects were treated with test or reference formulation; 164 subjects completed the study. Regarding acetylsalicylic acid exposure, as reference within-subject standard deviation (SDW) was at least 0.294 for acetylsalicylic acid Cmax, AUClast, and AUC, the RSABE analysis method was used to assess bioequivalence for all three parameters. The point estimates were within the 0.80–1.25 range (1.19, 1.09, and 1.04, respectively), and upper one-sided 95% CIs of scaled average bioequivalence metric were at most 0 ( 0.30,  0.14, and  0.10, respectively). Thus, bioequivalence was demonstrated with acetylsalicylic acid. Bioequivalence was also achieved with clopidogrel as the 90% CIs for geometric mean ratios of clopidogrel Cmax, AUClast, and AUC were within the bioequivalence range (0.80–1.25). Conclusion: Application of the reference-scaled average bioequivalence approach to evaluate bioequivalence of acetylsalicylic acid in Chinese male and female healthy volunteers under fasting conditions demonstrated bioequivalence of test and reference formulations.

We assessed the prevalence of PDR and treatment outcomes among adults living with HIV-1 in Lilongwe, Malawi. Methods: We selected 200 participants at random from the Lighthouse Tenofovir Cohort Study (LighTen). Serum samples were drawn prior to treatment initiation in 2014 and 2015, frozen, and later analyzed for the presence of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations. Amplicons were sequenced and interpreted by Stanford HIVdb interpretation algorithm 8.4. We assessed treatment outcomes by evaluating clinical outcome and viral suppression at the end of the follow-up period in October 2019. Results: PDR testing was successful in 197 of 200 samples. The overall NNRTI- PDR prevalence was 13.7% (27/197). The prevalence of intermediate or high level NNRTI- PDR was 11.2% (22/197). The most common mutation was K103N (5.6%, 11/197), followed by Y181C (3.6%, 7/197). In one case, we detected an NRTI resistance mutation (M184V), in combination with multiple NNRTI resistance mutations. All HIV-1 isolates analyzed were of subtype C. Of the 27 patients with NNRTI- PDR, 9 were still alive, on ART, and virally suppressed at the end of follow-up. Conclusion: The prevalence of NNRTI- PDR was above the critical level of 10% suggested by the Global Action Plan on HIV Drug Resistance. The distribution of drug resistance mutations was similar to that seen in previous studies from the region, and further supports the introduction of integrase inhibitors in first-line treatment in Malawi. Furthermore, our findings underline the need for continued PDR surveillance and pharmacovigilance in Sub-Saharan Africa.;https://aidsrestherapy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12981-020-00282-3;3.2;3.8;4.4;;32434561;22;;;

We evaluated the bioequivalence of 2 doses of an FDC of extended-release metformin (metformin XR), empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, and linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, versus corresponding free tablet combinations. Methods: Two randomized, open-label, two-way crossover studies in healthy adults compared: 2 FDC tablets of empagliflozin 5 mg/linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin XR 1000 mg (Study 1; N = 30), 1 FDC tablet of empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg/metformin XR 1000 mg (Study 2; N = 30) versus corresponding dose of free combinations. Subjects received study medication under fed conditions; washout was 35 days between treatments. Primary endpoints: area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) from time 0 to last quantifiable data point for empagliflozin and metformin; AUC from time 0 to 72 hours for linagliptin, and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) for empagliflozin, linagliptin, and metformin. Bioequivalence was defined as adjusted geometric mean ratios (FDC: free combination) and two-sided 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of AUC and Cmax for each component within 80.00–125.00%. Results: Study 1: 27/29 and 28/30 treated participants were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis for the FDC and free combination periods, respectively. Study 2: 29/29 treated participants were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis for both periods. The adjusted geometric mean ratios of FDCs to their respective free tablet combinations and two-sided 90% CIs were all within the predefined range. The shapes of the mean plasma concentration–time profile of empagliflozin, linagliptin, and metformin XR were similar for subjects in the FDC and free combination groups in both studies. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion: The evaluated doses of empagliflozin/linagliptin/metformin XR FDC tablets were bioequivalent to the corresponding free combinations. Based on these two bioequivalence studies and existing phase 3 data, the FDA has recently approved this triple FDC to improve glycemic control in adults with T2D.";https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00325481.2020.1750228;3.7;3.7;4.2;;32366156;;;;

Regimens include two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus either an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), a non-NRTI (NNRTI) or a boosted protease inhibitor (PI). The objective was to examine the outcomes of recommended first-line ART in Germany. Methods: This nationwide observational study included treatment-naïve chronically HIV-1 infected patients receiving one of the recommended first-line regimens. Patients were allocated to three arms (INSTI, NNRTI, PI) and were prospectively followed for 24 months. Delayed treatment initiation was defined by a baseline CD4 T-cell count of < 350/µl or CDC clinical stage C. Results: Among a total of 434 patients enrolled, virologic failure was rare and occurred in 4.3% (6/141) in the PI arm, in 3.3% (4/122) in the NNRTI arm and in 0.6% (1/171) in the INSTI arm (p = 0.10). De novo drug resistance mutations developed in only two patients in the NNRTI arm. Nonetheless, treatment modifications were frequent (51%) and mostly performed for strategic reasons. Retention on all initial compounds at month 24 was 64%, 49%, and 22% in the INSTI, NNRTI and PI arms respectively. Delayed treatment initiation was common (47%) and more frequently observed in patients in the PI arm. It was not associated with virological failure. Conclusion: High efficacy and low virological failure rates were observed with recommended first-line regimens independent of delayed treatment initiation, chosen regimen and subsequent treatment modifications, demonstrating the validity of the current treatment guidelines.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s15010-020-01428-1;4.6;4.2;4.9;;32394345;;;;

Objective: To examine neurocognitive performance in a group of Ghanaians living with HIV and possible factors that contribute to their performance. Methods: One hundred and four patients were assessed using a selection of brief non-invasive neuropsychological assess-ments as well as the International HIV Dementia Scale. Psycho-behavioural factors (alcohol use, depression, and medication adherence) as well as demographic characteristics and functional daily activities were assessed to determine their association with neurocognitive performance, using linear regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses. Results: About 48% of the participants met the criteria for risk of neurocognitive impairment. Age, education, and symptoms of depression were found to be significantly associated with the risk of impairment. Conclusion: Some people living with HIV showed risk of neurocognitive impairment, which was significantly associated with education, age and depressive symptoms. It is therefore important to consider routine neurocognitive screening in HIV management to recognize any risks for early interventions.;https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ahs/article/view/197820;2.2;2.2;2.0;;;;;;

Here we present a pre-specified pooled analysis of PINNACLE-1, PINNACLE-2, and PINNACLE-4. Methods: PINNACLE-1, -2, and -4 were multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trials that enrolled patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD, with no requirement for exacerbation history or a high symptom burden. Patients received GFF MDI 18/9.6 g, glycopyrrolate (GP) MDI 18 g, formoterol fumarate (FF) MDI 9.6 g, or placebo MDI, twice-daily for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint of the pooled analysis was the change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) at week 24. Secondary endpoints included COPD exacerbations and clinically important deterioration (CID). Adverse events were also assessed. Results: The pooled intent-to-treat population included 4983 patients; of these, 61.9% had a COPD assessment test (CAT) score 15, and 25.0% had experienced 1 moderate/severe exacerbation in the past year. At week 24, GFF MDI improved morning pre-dose trough FEV1 versus GP MDI (least squares mean [LSM] difference [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 59 mL [43, 75]), FF MDI (65 mL [48, 81]), and placebo MDI (146 mL [125, 166]); all p < 0.0001. GFF MDI reduced the risk of a moderate/severe exacerbation by 18% (p = 0.0168), 15% (p = 0.0628), and 28% (p = 0.0012) compared with GP MDI, FF MDI, and placebo MDI, respectively. In general, exacerbation risk reduction with GFF MDI versus comparators was greater in subgroups of symptomatic patients (CAT 15) and those who had an exacerbation history, than in the pooled intent-to-treat population. The risk of CID was also lower with GFF MDI versus GP MDI (23% decrease), FF MDI (17%), and placebo MDI (49%); all p < 0.0001. All treatments were well tolerated, with no unexpected safety signals. Conclusions: This pooled analysis of the PINNACLE studies demonstrated that GFF MDI improved lung function and reduced the risk of exacerbations compared with monocomponents and placebo in patients with COPD. Exacerbation reductions with GFF MDI versus comparators were generally greater in patients with higher symptom burden and those with exacerbation history.

FeistleObjective: Asthma patients often have co-existing symptoms of allergic rhinitis and are often prescribed with both asthma and rhinitis treatments such as montelukast and levocetirizine. The objective of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of a montelukast/levocetirizine fixed-dose combination chewable tablet with individual administration of montelukast and levocetirizine in healthy subjects. Materials and methods: A randomized, open-label, single-dose crossover study was conducted in healthy male subjects. One of the following treatments was administered in each period: co-administration of 1 chewable tablet of montelukast 5 mg and 1 tablet of levocetirizine 5 mg or administration of 1 chewable tablet of montelukast/levocetirizine 5/5 mg fixed-dose combination. Serial blood samples were collected up to 48 hours post dose. Plasma drug concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from dosing to the last measurable concentration (AUClast), were determined by non-compartmental analysis. The geometric least-square mean (GLSM) ratios and associated 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of Cmax and AUClast were calculated to evaluate pharmacokinetic equivalence. Results: A total of 22 subjects were included in pharmacokinetic analysis. The GLSM ratios and 90% CIs of Cmax and AUClast were 1.0054 (0.9535 - 1.0601) and 1.0628 (1.0013 - 1.1281) for montelukast and 1.0105 (0.9488 - 1.0764) and 1.0396 (0.9935 - 1.0879) for levocetirizine, respectively. Conclusion: The pharmacokinetic parameters of montelukast and levocetirizine when administered as separate tablets or as a fixed-dose combination were compared, and the parameters met the pharmacokinetic equivalence criteria.

In this paper, beach profile survey data of four years 2003 (before nourishment), 2005-2007 (after nourishment) and 11 beach profile chainages were analyzed to measure the closure depth using the Fixed Depth Change (FDC) method for the case study at Teluk Cempedak, Kuantan. The results from the measured closure depth were then compared to that calculated from the Hallermeier equations. The Hs0.137% wave height was determined by a wave refraction model that was developed and analyzed against offshore wave heights to predict the onshore wave heights at a depth of 10 m using Delft3D model. In comparison, the predictive equation showed an underestimate of the average closure depth of approximately 5%. This underprediction could be due to the inclusion of closure depths that are captured at the mid-zone for the chainage profiles that are located near the southern headland. Neglecting these chainage profiles lead to an over-prediction of the closure depth. This is consistent with the concept of Hallermeiers that the predictive equation determines an upper limit value of the closure depth. The new closure depth for the studied area was established and can be equated to 0.8 times Hs0.137%.;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/849/1/012093;0.4;0.5;0.6;;;012093;;;

Recent strategies for the optimization ADCs include the development of antibody fragment–drug conjugates (FDCs). The critical factor in the successful development of ADCs and FDCs is the identification of tumor antigen-specific and internalizing antibodies (Abs). However, systematic comparison or correlation studies of internalization rates with different antibody formats have not been reported previously. In this study, we generated a panel of scFv-phage Abs using phage display technology and their corresponding scFv and scFv-Fc fragments and evaluated their relative internalization kinetics in relation to their antibody forms. We found that the relative rates and levels of internalization of scFv-phage antibodies positively correlate with their scFv and scFv-Fc forms. Our systematic study demonstrates that endocytosis of scFv-phage can serve as a predictive indicator for the assessment of Ab fragment internalization. Additionally, the present study demonstrates that endocytic antibodies can be rapidly screened and selected from phage antibody libraries prior to the conversion of phage antibodies for the generation of the conventional antibody format. Our strategic approach for the identification and evaluation of endocytic antibodies would expedite the selection for optimal antibodies and antibody fragments and be broadly applicable to ADC and FDC development.;https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/6/955;8.8;8.5;2.3;;32630402;955;;;

For this purpose, 12 HIV/AIDS carrier patients with CD4+ T cell counts <500, and who had received the same antiretroviral therapy for at least 1 year before starting this investigation were selected. The patients were required to dissolve the effervescent glutamine formulation (supplied in sachets) in water immediately before oral ingestion (12.4 g), once a day, after lunch or after dinner during 30 days. CD4+ T cell counts, complete blood cell counts, serum cytokines, and amino acids levels were quantified; biochemical and toxicological measurements were performed. The numbers of CD4+ T cells were increased (P < .05), and the serum C-reactive protein levels decreased (P < .01) after the administration of effervescent glutamine formulation. Serum levels of interferon-gamma inducible protein-10, RANTES, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 were decreased after the treatment with effervescent glutamine formulation. No changes were observed in the serum levels of amino acids, hematological, toxicological, and biochemical parameters. In conclusion, the treatment during 30 days with effervescent glutamine formulation was well tolerated, promoted reduction of inflammation, and improved the beneficial effects of antiretroviral therapies in HIV/AIDS carrier patients.";https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/jmf.2019.0129;3.8;3.7;3.6;;31634026;;;;

We sought to ascertain the contributory effect of SNPs in four key genes linked to dolutegravir disposition (UGT1A1, ABCG2, CYP3A and NR1I2) on plasma dolutegravir pharmacokinetics. Methods: Paired pharmacogenetic/pharmacokinetic data from 93 subjects were analysed for association using multivariate linear regression. Results: Co-occurring UGT128 and NR1I2 c.63396C>T homozygosity was associated with a 79% increase in AUC0-24 (P = 0.001; 27% if analysed individually), whilst combined ABCG2 c.421C>A and NR1I2 c.63396C>T variants were associated with a 43% increase in Cmax (P = 0.002) and a 39% increase in AUC0-24 (P = 0.002). When analysed individually, homozygosity for the NR1I2 c.63396C>T variant alleles was associated with a 28% increase in Cmax (P = 0.033) and homozygosity for the ABCG2 c.421C>A variant alleles was associated with a 28% increase in Cmax (P = 0.047). The UGT1A128 (rs8175347) poor metabolizer status (28/28; 28/37; 37/37) was individually associated with a 27% increase in AUC0-24 (P = 0.020). The combination of UGT1A128 poor metabolizer and UGT1A16 intermediate metabolizer statuses correlated with a 43% increase in AUC0-24 (P = 0.023). Conclusions: This study showed a pharmacogenetic association between dolutegravir pharmacokinetics and variants in the ABCG2, UGT1A1 and NR1I2 genes, particularly when combined. Further research is warranted to confirm these associations in population-specific studies and to investigate their putative relationship with dolutegravir pharmacodynamics.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/5/1259/5721437;8.7;7.7;8.3;;32011683;;;;

We aimed to investigate virological suppression before giving birth with dolutegravir compared with efavirenz, when initiated during the third trimester. Methods: In this randomised, open-label trial, DolPHIN-2, we recruited pregnant women in South Africa and Uganda aged at least 18 years, with untreated but confirmed HIV infection and an estimated gestation of at least 28 weeks, initiating ART in third trimester. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to dolutegravir-based or efavirenz-based therapy. HIV viral load was measured 7 days and 28 days after antiretroviral initiation, at 36 weeks' gestation, and at the post-partum visit (0–14 days post partum). The primary efficacy outcome was a viral load of less than 50 copies per mL at the first post-partum visit, and the primary safety outcome was the occurrence of drug-related adverse events in mothers and infants until the post-partum visit. Longer-term follow-up of mothers and infants continues. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03249181. Findings: Between Jan 23, and Aug 15, 2018, we randomly assigned 268 mothers to dolutegravir (135) or efavirenz (133). All mothers and their infants were included in the safety analysis, and 250 mothers (125 in the dolutegravir group, 125 in the efavirenz group) and their infants in efficacy analyses, by intention-to-treat analyses. The median duration of maternal therapy at birth was 55 days (IQR 33–77). 89 (74%) of 120 in the dolutegravir group had viral loads less than 50 copies per mL, compared with 50 (43%) of 117 in the efavirenz group (risk ratio 1·64, 95% CI 1·31–2·06). 30 (22%) of 137 mothers in the dolutegravir group reported serious adverse events compared with 14 (11%) of 131 in the efavirenz group (p=0·013), particularly surrounding pregnancy and puerperium. We found no differences in births less than 37 weeks and less than 34 weeks gestation (16·4% vs 3·3%, across both groups). Three stillbirths in the dolutegravir group and one in the efavirenz group were considered unrelated to treatment. Three infant HIV infections were detected, all in the dolutegravir group, and were considered likely to be in-utero transmissions. Interpretation: Our data support the revision to WHO guidelines recommending the transition to dolutegravir in first-line ART for all adults, regardless of pregnancy or child-bearing potential.

MF at low (80 g) and high (320 g) doses delivered via Breezhaler® is expected to be comparable to MF at low (200 g) and high (800 g) doses respectively, delivered via Twisthaler®. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, four-week, parallel-group study of 739 adolescents and adults with persistent asthma. Eligible patients were receiving ICS treatment up to the maximum dose per day on a stable regimen for at least four weeks before screening. The study population was enriched for patients who were responsive to ICS therapy. The primary objective of the present study was to show non-inferiority of these doses, i.e. the low (80 g) and high (320 g) doses of MF delivered via Breezhaler® once daily, compared with the corresponding low (200 g) and high (800 g) doses of MF delivered via Twisthaler® once daily. The primary endpoint was 24 h post-dose trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), after four weeks of treatment in patients with asthma. A secondary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of MF 80 g and 320 g delivered via Breezhaler®, and MF 200 g and 800 g delivered via Twisthaler® in terms of Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5) after one, two, three and four weeks of treatment. Results: The LS mean difference in trough FEV1 after four weeks of treatment between MF low dose 80 g (Breezhaler®) and MF low dose 200 g (Twisthaler®) was 27 mL (95% CI –34, 89); for MF high dose 320 g (Breezhaler®) and MF high dose 800 g (Twisthaler®) the difference was 0 mL (95% CI –60, 61). These differences were neither clinically nor statistically significant. All treatment arms provided similar clinically relevant improvements in ACQ-5 after four weeks of treatment compared with baseline. Both treatments showed a similar safety profile with a low incidence of adverse events. Conclusion: The similarities in effects on lung function and ACQ after four weeks of treatment demonstrate the comparability of MF at low (80 g) and high (320 g) doses delivered with Breezhaler® with MF at low (200 g) and high (800 g) doses delivered with Twisthaler®, respectively. The study formally demonstrated that MF, delivered via Breezhaler®, is non-inferior to MF, delivered via Twisthaler® at corresponding ICS doses.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1094553920301231;4.9;4.9;4.3;S1094553920301231;32387408;101919;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1094553920301231;;

We report week-144 efficacy and safety results from these studies. Methods: We did two double-blind, active-controlled studies (now in open-label extension phase). Study 1 randomly assigned (1:1) HLA-B*5701-negative adults without hepatitis B virus co-infection to receive coformulated bictegravir 50 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg, or coformulated dolutegravir 50 mg, abacavir 600 mg, and lamivudine 300 mg once daily. Study 2 randomly assigned (1:1) adults to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, or dolutegravir 50 mg given with coformulated emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg. We previously reported non-inferiority at the primary endpoint. Here, we report the week-144 secondary outcome of proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL at week 144, by US Food and Drug Administration Snapshot algorithm, analysed in the same manner. These studies were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02607930 and NCT02607956. Findings: 629 participants were randomly assigned and treated in study 1 (314 to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, and 315 to dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine) and 645 in study 2 (327 to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, 325 to dolutegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide). At week 144, bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide was non-inferior to both dolutegravir-containing regimens for efficacy. In study 1, 256 (82%) of 314 participants had plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL in the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group and 265 (84%) of 315 in the dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine group (difference 2·6%, 95% CI 8·5 to 3·4). In study 2, 262 (82%) of 320 participants had plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL in the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group and 273 (84%) of 325 in the dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group (difference 1·9%, 7·8 to 3·9). In both studies, no participant had treatment-emergent resistance to study drugs up to week 144. All treatment regimens were well tolerated with additional exposure. Adverse events that led to study drug discontinuation were reported for no participants in the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group versus five (2%) of 315 in the dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine group (study 1), and six (2%) of 320 in the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide versus six (2%) of 325 in the dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group (study 2). In study 1, statistically significant differences were observed in median changes from baseline in fasting total cholesterol (14 mg/dL vs 10 mg/dL; p=0·034), direct LDL (21 mg/dL vs 14 mg/dL; p=0·004), and total cholesterol to HDL ratio (0·1 vs 0·3; p=0·007) at week 144; no differences were observed between groups in study 2. Weight gain was seen across all treatment groups in both studies, with no differences in median changes from baseline in weight at week 144 for either study. Interpretation: These long-term data support the use of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide as a safe, well tolerated, and durable treatment for people with HIV, with no emergent resistance.

Knowledge of the atypical morphology and immunophenotype of FDCS is critical to avoid misdiagnosis. Here we presented a case of extranodal FDCS with an unusual morphology and a previously unreported immunophenotype leading to misdiagnosis. A 32-years-old man presented with a tonsilar mass that showed epithelioid cells in nested and alveolar patterns. Immunohistochemistry study revealed that the tumor cells were positive for CD4 and CD30, and were negative for cytokeratin, CD3, CD20, CD68, CD163, lysozyme, ALK, S-100, and desmin. Multiple outside expert consultations rendered a consensus diagnosis of ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). The patient received multiple lines of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the residual tumor progressively enlarged eight months later and a more complex morphology was presented in the re-excised tumor: including spindle cells with vesicular nuclei and nuclear pseudoinclusions in fascicles or a whorled pattern, and plump ovoid cells arranged in meningioma-like whorls as well as epithelioid tumor cells similar to the initial biopsy. All these three components were positive for CD4, CD21, CD23, and CD35. The diagnosis was revised to FDCS after a positive immunostaining for CD21, CD23, and CD35 on the initial specimen was confirmed retrospectively. A literature review identified 57 cases of FDCS published from 2009 through 2019, and 13 (22.8%) of them were misdiagnosed at initial presentation. Among these misdiagnosed cases, all except one case were extranodal, and the incorrect initial diagnosis was mostly location-related. These cases expand the pathologic spectrum of FDCS, and further emphasize the necessity for pathologists to stay alert for this rare entity, bringing FDCS into the differentials for any spindle cell tumors, undifferentiated epithelioid cell tumors, and ALCL to avoid misdiagnosis.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fonc.2020.00876/full;8.6;5.4;3.5;;;876;;;

Antibodies targeting the checkpoint inhibitor (CKI) programmed cell death protein-1 (PD1) have demonstrated the efficacy as monotherapies in second-line treatment of SCCA. The aim of this study is to evaluate the combination of atezolizumab and mDCF as first-line chemotherapy in a non-comparative multicentre randomized phase II study of advanced SCCA patients. Methods: Patients with chemo-naive advanced histologically proven SCCA, metastatic or unresectable locally advanced recurrence, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-performance status (ECOG-PS) < 2 will be eligible. The primary endpoint is a 12-month PFS rate. Using one-arm non-parametric survival with unilateral alpha type I error of 5% and a statistical power of 80%, the upper critical value for the 12-month PFS rate is 47% to reject H0. Assuming 5% lost to follow-up, 99 patients will be randomized on a 2:1 basis, 66 to the experimental arm (arm A, mDCF plus atezolizumab) and 33 to the standard arm (arm B, mDCF). In both arms, 8 cycles of mDCF will be administered. In arm A, patients receive mDCF with a fixed dose of atezolizumab (800 mg every 2 weeks) and are followed up to 1 year. Secondary endpoints are overall survival, PFS, response rate, safety, health-related quality of life, and an extensive biomarker programme and its correlation with the treatment efficacy. Discussion: Although the Epitopes-HPV02 trial has changed long-lasting prognosis of patients with SCCA in advanced stage disease, more than 50% of patients will progress at 12 months. The purpose of the SCARCE trial to establish the addition of atezolizumab to mDCF as a new standard in this rare disease.

The fixed-dose combination tablet of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as PrEP for adults in 2012. Since then, recognition has been increasing that adolescents at risk for acquiring HIV can benefit from PrEP. In 2018, FDA approved revised labeling for TDF/FTC that expanded the indication for PrEP to include adolescents weighing at least 77 lb (35 kg) who are at risk for acquiring HIV. In 2019, FDA approved the combination product tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/FTC as PrEP for adolescents and adults weighing at least 77 lb (35 kg), excluding those at risk for acquiring HIV through receptive vaginal sex. This exclusion is due to the lack of clinical data regarding the efficacy of TAF/FTC in cisgender women. Clinical providers who evaluate adolescents for PrEP use must consider certain topics that are unique to the adolescent population. Important considerations related to adolescents include PrEP safety data, legal issues about consent for clinical care and confidentiality, the therapeutic partnership with adolescents and their parents or guardians, the approach to the adolescent patient's clinical visit, and medication initiation, adherence, and persistence during adolescence. Overall, data support the safety of PrEP for adolescents. PrEP providers should be familiar with the statutes and regulations about the provision of health care to minors in their states. Providers should partner with the adolescent patient for PrEP decisions, recognizing the adolescent's autonomy to the extent allowable by law and including parents in the conversation about PrEP when it is safe and reasonable to do so. A comprehensive approach to adolescent health is recommended, including considering PrEP as one possible component of providing medical care to adolescents who inject drugs or engage in sexual behaviors that place them at risk for acquiring HIV. PrEP adherence declined over time in the studies evaluating PrEP among adolescents, a trend that also has been observed among adult patients. Clinicians should implement strategies to address medication adherence as a routine part of prescribing PrEP; more frequent clinical follow-up is one possible approach. PrEP is an effective HIV prevention tool for protecting adolescents at risk for HIV acquisition. For providers, unique considerations that are part of providing PrEP to adolescents include the possible need for more frequent, supportive interactions to promote medication adherence. Recommendations for PrEP medical management and additional resources for providers are available in the U.S. Public Health Service clinical practice guideline Preexposure Prophylaxis for the Prevention of HIV Infection in the United States-2017 Update and the clinical providers' supplement Preexposure Prophylaxis for the Prevention of HIV Infection in the United States-2017 Update: Clinical Providers' Supplement (https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/clinicians/prevention/prep.html).";http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/rr/rr6903a1.htm?s_cid=rr6903a1_w;104.3;153.9;152.5;;32324724;;;;

The FDC gives information on the water regime, providing information to optimally manage the water resources of the river. In spite of its importance, because of the lack of streamflow gauging stations, the FDC construction can be a not straightforward task. In partially gauged basins, FDCs are usually built using regionalization among the other methods. In this paper we show that the FDC is not a characteristic of the basin only, but of both the basin and the weather. Different weather conditions lead to different FDCs for the same catchment. The differences can often be significant. Similarly, the FDC built at a site for a specific period cannot be used to retrieve the FDC at a different site for the same time window. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to estimate FDCs at partially gauged basins (i.e., target sites) using precipitation data gauged at another basin (i.e., donor site). The main idea is that it is possible to retrieve the FDC of a target period of time using the data gauged during a given donor time period for which data are available at both target and donor sites. To test the methodology, several donor and target time periods are analyzed and results are shown for different sites in the USA. The comparison between estimated and actually observed FDCs shows the reasonability of the approach, especially for intermediate percentiles.;https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/24/2043/2020/;6.6;6.9;7.8;;;;;;

The method is being reported for the first time and includes an estimation of degradation products produced post-stress conditions without any extraction or derivatization. The chromatographic separation of the drugs was achieved with a Symmetry Shield RP18 Column (100 Å, 5 m, 4.6 mm × 250 mm) using a mixture of buffer, methanol and acetonitrile (42:27:31 v/v/v) as mobile phase. The buffer used in mobile phase contained 35 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and its pH was adjusted to 7.0 ± 0.02 with 20% orthophosphoric acid. The instrument was set at flow rate of 1.2 mL min-1 at ambient temperature and the wavelength of UV-visible detector at 275 nm. The developed method could be suitable for the quantitative determination of these drugs in pharmaceutical preparations and also for quality control in bulk manufacturing. Stress testing was performed to prove the specificity. No interference was observed from its stress degradation products. The statistical analysis was done by using F-test and t-test at 95% confidence level.;https://academic.oup.com/chromsci/article/58/4/346/5700593;2.1;2.5;2.6;;31953544;;;;

In this study, an alternative, a simple, sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography method has been developed (limit of detection: 15 ng/mL and limit of quantification: 50 ng/mL) for simultaneous estimation of this drug combination in rat plasma. Most remarkably, bioavailability of NAT has been increased markedly on coadministration with PIO, than when it was administered alone. Thus, PIO is assumed to retard the catabolism of NAT by inhibiting metabolic liver-microsomal enzyme, especially CYP2C9. Using a Waters Nova-Pak C 18 column (150 × 3.9 mm, 4 m) and a mobile phase of acetonitrile: 10 mM KH2PO4 (60: 40, V/V (volume by volume)) pH 3.5, the analysis was performed at 210 nm with a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. In silico docking via molecular dynamics simulation revealed that NAT-CYP2C9 binding affinity may be reduced after PIO attachment, presumably due to the binding site overlapping of the two drugs. Thus, it has been proposed that NAT and PIO may be an efficient synergistic fixed dose combination against diabetes mellitus, and the above method can foster a simple but highly sensitive bioanalytical estimation for routine analysis.;https://academic.oup.com/chromsci/article/58/4/309/5673745;2.1;2.5;2.6;;31836899;;;;

Published by BMJ.Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS) is a rare and unusual cancer that arises from sustentacular cells of the lymph node that present antigen to B cells, rather than lymphocytes themselves. While surgery for primary disease is still paramount in primary management, for unresectable, recurrent and metastatic tumours, FDCS is frequently treated with anthracycline-based lymphoma chemotherapy regimens. In recent years, it is clear that Programmed Cell Death 1 (PD1)-directed immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are active in Hodgkin lymphoma, but significantly less active in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. These data raised the question of whether FDCS respond to ICI therapy. We present two patients with FDCS who were treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab with evidence of tumour response. These cases also highlight the difficulty in arriving at a proper diagnosis, emphasising the need for expert review of pathology to optimise treatment for these and other patients with sarcoma.;https://casereports.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bcr-2020-234363;0.6;0.6;0.6;;32327462;e234363;;;

Immaturity of the follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), in particular, appears to play a critical role for the inability to stimulate immune responses. Using the CD21mT/mG mouse model we found that at 7 days of life, FDCs exhibited a mature phenotype only in the Peyer´s patches (PP), but our unique adjuvant, CTA1-DD, effectively matured FDCs also in peripheral lymph nodes following systemic, as well as mucosal immunizations. This was a direct effect of complement receptor 2-binding to the FDC and a CTA1-enzyme-dependent enhancing effect on gene transcription, among which CR2, IL-6, ICAM-1, IL-1, and CXCL13 encoding genes were upregulated. This way we achieved FDC maturation, increased germinal center B-cell- and Tfh responses, and enhanced specific antibody levels close to adult magnitudes. Oral priming immunization of neonates against influenza infection with CTA1-3M2e-DD effectively promoted anti-M2e-immunity and significantly reduced morbidity against a live virus challenge infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate direct effects of an adjuvant on FDC gene transcriptional functions and the subsequent enhancement of neonatal immune responses.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41385-020-0253-2;13.3;12.6;12.7;;31959882;;;;

Methods: We enrolled 547 and 1064 adult participants on first-line ART for 12 (±3) months (ADR12) and 48 months (ADR48), respectively. Dried blood spots and plasma specimens were collected for VL testing and genotyping among the VFs. Results: VLS was 95.0% (95% CI 93.4%-96.5%) in the ADR12 group and 87.9% (95% CI 85.0%-90.9%) in the ADR48 group. The weighted prevalence of ADR was 96.1% (95% CI 72.9%-99.6%) in the ADR12 and 90.4% (95% CI 73.6-96.8%) in the ADR48 group, out of the 30 and 95 successful genotypes in the respective groups.

Conclusions: While good VLS was observed, the high prevalence of ADR among the VFs before they underwent the recommended three intensive adherence counselling (IAC) sessions followed by repeat VL testing implies that IAC prior to treatment switching may be of limited benefit in improving VLS.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/5/1280/5727896;8.7;7.7;8.3;;32025714;;;;

However, as the discontinuation of therapy leads to virus rebound in plasma within weeks, it is evident that, despite daily pill intake, the treatment is unable to clear the infection from the body. Furthermore, as cART drugs exhibit a much lower concentration in key HIV residual tissues, such as the brain and lymph nodes, there is a rationale for the development of drugs with enhanced tissue penetration. In addition, the treatment, with combinations of multiple different antiviral drugs that display different pharmacokinetic profiles, requires a strict dosing regimen to avoid the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains. An intriguing opportunity lies within the development of long-acting, synthetic scaffolds for delivering cART. These scaffolds can be designed with the goal to reduce the frequency of dosing and furthermore, hold the possibility of potential targeting to key HIV residual sites. Moreover, the synthesis of combinations of therapy as one molecule could unify the pharmacokinetic profiles of different antiviral drugs, thereby eliminating the consequences of sub-therapeutic concentrations. This review discusses the recent progress in the development of long-acting and tissue-targeted therapies against HIV for the delivery of direct antivirals, and examines how such developments fit in the context of exploring HIV cure strategies.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/4/412;5.8;5.3;4.3;;32272815;412;;;

Dyslipidaemia and other metabolic complications are commonly associated with PI use. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and adverse events between switching from PI-based to RPV-based regimen, versus continuing PI-based regimens in HIV-positive individuals with complete viral suppression. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in HIV-positive individuals receiving PI-based regimens with undetectable HIV RNA and without prior HIV drug resistance. Patients were enrolled between July and December 2017 in a university medical centre in Bangkok, Thailand. They were randomized to switch from PIs to RPV (switch group) or continue ritonavir-boosted PI (control group). Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with undetectable HIV RNA at 48 weeks. Changes in CD4 cell counts, lipid profiles and adverse events were also analysed. Results and discussion: A total of 84 patients were enrolled, 42 in each group. Mean age was 47.7 years and 53.6% were males. At 48 weeks, 95.2% of patients in the switch group and 92.9% of control group had maintained undetectable HIV RNA (difference rate 2.4%; 95% CI, 9.6 to 14.7). Means of CD4 cell counts were 611 and 641 cells/mm3 in switch and control groups respectively (p = 0.632). Mean changes in lipid profiles (switch vs. control groups) were: total cholesterol, 12.5 versus + 12.2 (p = 0.024); LDL, 3.4 versus + 6.2 (p = 0.040); HDL, +1.6 versus + 1.9 (p = 0.887); and triglycerides, 82.6 versus  24.4 mg/dL (p = 0.031). The mean changes of glucose and eGFR were similar (p > 0.05) between the two groups. The mean change of ALT was significantly greater in switch group (18.2 vs. 4.0 U/L, p = 0.017). One patient in switch group had anorexia and elevated ALT at 14 weeks and completely recovered after RPV discontinuation. Conclusions: Switching PIs to RPV, in patients with complete viral suppression and without prior HIV drug resistance, sustains viral suppression and yields better lipid profiles. This finding supports its use as switching therapy in patients receiving PI-based regimens due to intolerance to efavirenz and NVP and previous alternatives limited to PI in resource-limited settings.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jia2.25462;5.5;6.7;7.1;;32277868;e25462;;;

Methods: This phase 3, double-blind clinical trial enrolled adult patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease due to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors. Patients were randomly assigned (2:2:2:1) to treatment with the fixed-dose combination, bempedoic acid 180 mg, ezetimibe 10 mg or placebo added to stable background statin therapy for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change from baseline to week 12 in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Results: Among the 301 patients included in the primary analysis, the mean baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was 3.87 mmol/L (149.8 mg/dL). At week 12, the fixed-dose combination lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (–36.2%) significantly more than placebo (1.8% (placebo-corrected difference –38.0%); P < 0.001), ezetimibe alone (–23.2%; P < 0.001) or bempedoic acid alone (–17.2%; P < 0.001). The fixed-dose combination lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels similarly across subgroups, including patients receiving high-intensity, other-intensity or no statin therapy. Improvements with the fixed-dose combination were also observed in secondary efficacy endpoints, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. In this trial, fixed-dose combination treatment had a generally similar safety profile compared with bempedoic acid, ezetimibe or placebo. Conclusion: The bempedoic acid and ezetimibe fixed-dose combination significantly lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol versus placebo or other oral monotherapies and had a favourable safety profile when added to maximally tolerated statin therapy in patients with hypercholesterolemia and high cardiovascular disease risk.

There are numerous clinical trials proving the efficacy of cyclosporine in psoriasis in inducing remission and maintaining results, although there are few studies about the treatment optimization of cyclosporine. METHODS: We performed a 15-year retrospective observational study comparing two groups of psoriatic patients matched for age and sex. We assessed the clinical response, the safety and the compliance who took fixed dose of 200 mg cyclosporine (range 2.2-3.3 mg/kg) compared with a group of patients who took body weight-based dosage. Student's t-test was used to assess the difference in terms of PASI 75 achievement, patient-reported compliance on a five-point scale, DLQI questionnaire, laboratory values and blood pressure. RESULTS: PASI 75 achievement was not statistically different between the two groups. Compliance was good in both groups, and DLQI was also comparable. Laboratory values and blood pressure were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups in PASI reduction and PASI 75 achievement, even though the fixed dose was often lower (range 2.2-3.3 mg/kg) than the dosage administered depending on weight. Fixed dose cyclosporine is simple and practical to use in specific clinical settings, in particular when the patient's weight ranges from 60 to 90 kg. This approach can result in improved clinical outcomes and a better quality of life for psoriatic patients.;https://www.minervamedica.it/index2.php?show=R23Y2020N02A0146;1.9;1.8;1.5;;29368846;;;;

Then, for the first time, we showed that a combination of the aforementioned geometrical methods and the application of a nonlinear field-dependent conductivity (FDC) layer could address the issue. Simulations were done under a 50 Hz sinusoidal AC voltage per IEC 61287-1. However, in practice, the insulation materials of the envisaged WBG power modules will be under square wave voltage pulses with a frequency of up to a few tens of kHz and temperatures up to a few hundred degrees. The relative permittivity and electrical conductivity of aluminum nitride (AlN) ceramic, silicone gel, and nonlinear FDC materials that were assumed to be constant in our previous studies, may be frequency- and temperature-dependent, and their dependency should be considered in the model. This is the case for other papers dealing with electric field calculation within power electronics modules, where the permittivity and AC electrical conductivity of the encapsulant and ceramic substrate materials are assumed at room temperature and for a 50 or 60 Hz AC sinusoidal voltage. Thus, the big question that remains unanswered is whether or not electric field simulations are valid for high temperature and high-frequency conditions. In this paper, this technical gap is addressed where a frequency- and temperature-dependent finite element method (FEM) model of the insulation system envisaged for a 6.5 kV high-density WBG power module will be developed in COMSOL Multiphysics, where a protruding substrate combined with the application of a nonlinear FDC layer is considered to address the high field issue. By using this model, the influence of frequency and temperature on the effectiveness of the proposed electric field reduction method is studied.;https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/8/2022;3.1;3.3;3.8;;;2022;;;

All rights reserved.Based on daily streamflow data at 7 stations during 1956-2016 and daily precipitation data at 72 stations during 1960-2016 in the Huai River Basin (HRB), the eco-surplus and eco-deficit under influences of abrupt streamflow behaviors were analyzed using Flow Duration Curve (FDC). Regarding the relations between ecological indicators and hydrological alteration indicators, we analyzed the ecological effects of the altered hydrological processes. Besides, we also quantified fractional contributions of climatic indices to ecological flow using Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) framework. The results indicated that: (1) the FDC was subject to general decrease due to hydrological alterations, and most streamflow components were lower than 25% FDC. We found the decreased eco-surplus and the increased eco-deficit due to altered hydrological processes. The FDC of the streamflow along the mainstream of the HRB was lower than that along the tributaries of the HRB. The changes of eco-surplus (eco-deficit) matched well those of precipitation anomalies. The hydrological regulations of water reservoirs acted as the major factor behind mismatch between summer ecological flow and precipitation anomalies. (2) Eco-deficit (eco-surplus) was increasing (decreasing) at annual and seasonal scales with exception of winter season. In winter, the eco-surplus was higher than other seasons. However, the eco-surplus was decreasing persistently. The 21st century witnessed the lowest eco-surplus along the main streamflow of the HRB and Shannon index indicated the decreased ecological diversity across the HRB. (3) The ecological flow was highly sensitive to Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Nino3.4. Meanwhile, the ecological flow along the main stream of the HRB was highly sensitive to climate indices. While the ecological flow by GAMLSS model had better performance in the fitting of extreme value and local trend.;http://www.ecologica.cn/stxb/ch/reader/view_abstract.aspx?doi=10.5846/stxb201903080438;0.8;1.0;1.1;;;;;;

This study, therefore, presents an assessment of streamflow recession characteristics in relation to the hydrostratigraphy property of watershed. The streamflow recession assessment was carried out by computing the flow duration curve (FDC) and baseflow index (BFI) analyses of 28 year streamflow records at six distinct streamflow gauging stations. Digital processed aeromagnetic map was hybridized with geological survey and map review for the construction and characterization of concise watershed surficial lithology. The FDC plot of low-flow slopes and Q95 reported the flow per station as thus; Buffalo ( 0.0113; 0.0026), Tshoxa ( 0.0029, 0.0016), Yellowwoods ( 0.0022, 0.0008), Mgqakwebe ( 0.0017, 0.0007), Quencwe ( 0.0009, 0.0002), and Ngqokweni ( 0.0005, 0.0001). Similarly, BFI results show the following rank: Buffalo (0.541), Yellowwoods (0.488), Tshoxa (0.450), Mgqakwebe (0.443), Quencwe (0.415), and Ngqokweni (0.332). The recession analysis revealed that the Q95 slope of the stochastic FDC approach is a more reliable recession estimate for environmental flow. The assessment of the recession–lithology relationship suggests that the porosity network of the contact zone and fracture system of dolerite may produce a weightier impact of baseflow discharge in support of environmental flow over the hydraulic conductivity of sandstone. The physiographic trends of streamflow response suggest the influence of the high relief on streamflow flux. The overall results suggest that the hybrid approach of FDC and BFI analyses are highly effective for replicating the streamflow recession at the catchment stage and could be adopted for investigation of river sustainability.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12665-020-08925-4;3.0;3.6;4.0;;;187;;;

A confluence of chemistry and engineering continues to improve the sensitivity and selectivity for several classes of harmful chemicals with the promise of cheap and portable sensing. Herein, following the function-oriented research strategy, eight novel lanthanide coordination polymers (Ln-CPs) have been successfully assembled with the framework composition [Ln(2,5-FDC)0.5(Adip)(H2O)2] (Ln = Nd (1), Sm (2), Eu (3), Gd (4), Tb (5), Dy (6), Ho (7), Er (8), 2,5-FDC2- = furan-2,5-dicarboxylate, Adip2- = Adipate) under solvothermal synthesis conditions. The structural analysis indicates that all the eight CPs have the same structural features. All compounds crystallize in the orthorhombic crystal system (space group Pnma) with point symbol {33·44·53} and consist of 2D cem topological type. The linkers 2,5-FDC2- and Adip2- exhibit 2-4,1:1:1:1 and 3-5,2:1:1:1 coordination modes respectively. The as-synthesized polymers were characterized by powder X-ray crystallography, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and photoluminescence studies. CP-3 and CP-5 are promising luminescent lanthanide coordination polymers (Ln-CPs) and function as efficient sensors for the detection of nitroaromatic compounds at the ppm level in mix N,N-dimethyl formamide-aqueous medium via the luminescence quenching mechanism.;http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=D0NJ01018A;4.7;4.5;4.7;;;;;;

This study evaluated real world adherence and persistence of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART), comparing STRs and MTRs. Methods: Adult Medicaid beneficiaries (aged  18 years) initiating ART with  2 ART claims during the identification period (January 1, 2015-December 31, 2016) and continuous health plan enrollment for a 12-month baseline period were included. For STRs, the first ART claim date was defined as the index date; for MTRs, the prescription fill claim date for the last drug in the regimen was defined as the index date, and prescription fills were required to occur within a 5-day window. Adherence was assessed in 30-day intervals over a 6-month period, with adherence defined as having less than a 5-day gap between fills. Persistence was evaluated as median number of days on therapy and percent persistence at 12 months. Cox Proportional Hazard models were used to evaluate risk of discontinuation, controlling for baseline and clinical characteristics. Results: A total of 1,744 (STR = 1290; MTR = 454) and 2409 (STR = 1782; MTR = 627) patients newly prescribed ART had available data concerning adherence and persistence, respectively. Average age ranged 40-42 years. The patient population was predominantly male. Adherence assessments showed 22.7% of STR initiators were adherent to their index regimens over a 6-month period compared to 11.7% of MTR initiators. Unadjusted persistence analysis showed 36.3% of STR initiators discontinued first-line therapy compared to 48.8% for MTR initiators over the 2-year study period. Controlling for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, MTR initiators had a higher risk of treatment discontinuation (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.6, p < 0.0001). Among STRs, compared to the referent elvitegravir(EVG)/cobicistat(COBI)/emtricitabine(FTC)/tenofovir alafenamide(TAF), risk of discontinuation was higher for efavirenz(EFV)/FTC/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate(TDF) (HR = 3.6, p < 0.0001), EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF (HR = 2.8, p < 0.0001), and abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC)/dolutegravir (DTG) (HR = 1.8, p = 0.004). Among backbones, FTC/TAF was associated with lower risk of discontinuation than FTC/TDF (HR = 4.4, p < 0.0001) and ABC/3TC (HR = 2.2, p < 0.0001).

Although clinical trials describe the efficacy and safety of these FDCs, their use in daily clinical practice can present challenges for the clinician in two specific scenarios. In patients who are already receiving triple therapy via different devices, switching to FDCs could confer benefits by reducing critical errors in the management of inhalers, improving therapeutic adherence, and lowering costs, while maintaining the same clinical efficacy. In patients who are not receiving triple therapy in different devices and who require a change in treatment, triple therapy FDC has shown benefits in clinical trials. Although methodological differences among the trials advise against direct comparison, clinical results show good efficacy, but also considerable variability, and a number of clinical outcomes have yet to be explored. In the future, trials must be developed to complete clinical efficacy data. Real-world efficacy trials are needed, and studies must be designed to determine the profile of patients who present a greater therapeutic response to each FDC in order to pave to way towards more personalized treatment.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0300289619305794;1.6;1.5;1.5;S0300289619305794;31983474;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0300289619305794;;

Netarsudil, a novel Rho kinase inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, reduces intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing trabecular outflow. Two phase 3 superiority studies compared a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of netarsudil and the prostaglandin latanoprost with each active component for IOP-lowering efficacy. Methods: Pooled efficacy and safety data were analyzed from MERCURY-1 and -2 studies in patients with OAG or OHT. Patients instilled one drop of netarsudil (0.02%)/latanoprost (0.005%) FDC (n = 483), netarsudil (0.02%, n = 499), or latanoprost (0.005%, n = 486) into each eye once-daily between 20:00 and 22:00. IOP was measured at 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 at weeks 2, 6, and the primary endpoint at month 3. Results: Baseline mean diurnal IOP was 23.6, 23.6, and 23.5 mmHg in netarsudil/latanoprost FDC, netarsudil, and latanoprost groups, respectively. Mean diurnal IOP in each group was 15.3, 18.1, and 17.5 mmHg at week 2, 15.7, 18.4, and 17.4 mmHg at week 6, and 15.8, 18.4, and 17.3 mmHg at week 12. The netarsudil/latanoprost FDC met criteria for superiority compared with each active component (p < 0.0001 for all nine time points). At month 3, among patients randomized to netarsudil/latanoprost FDC or latanoprost, 58.4% vs 37.3% (p < 0.0001) achieved IOP  16 mmHg. Among patients randomized to netarsudil/latanoprost FDC or netarsudil or latanoprost, 30.9% vs 5.9% (p < 0.0001) vs 8.5% (p < 0.0001) achieved at least a 40% reduction from baseline in mean diurnal IOP. Pooled safety results were consistent with individual MERCURY studies. Conclusion: Once-daily netarsudil/latanoprost FDC produced statistically significant and clinically relevant reductions in mean IOP that were statistically superior to IOP reductions achieved by netarsudil and latanoprost monotherapy. Results of the pooled efficacy and safety analyses were consistent with the individual studies.

Many patients do not achieve sufficient IOP lowering with a single drug. The use of multiple IOP-lowering agents, which may have different dose regimens, can be complex and reduce patient adherence. Combination treatments that incorporate multiple agents are available, but until recently none included a prostaglandin analogue, the most widely prescribed first-line therapy. A once-daily, fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapy (ROCKLATAN®) has been approved in the USA that contains the prostaglandin analogue latanoprost and netarsudil, a novel Rho kinase inhibitor. The netarsudil/latanoprost FDC demonstrated efficacy and safety in lowering IOP among patients with OAG and OHT in the 12-month MERCURY-1 and the 3-month MERCURY-2 clinical trials. To better characterize efficacy and safety, we pooled and analyzed the data from each trial. The pooled data support the findings of the individual studies: Efficacy: 1. Netarsudil/latanoprost FDC demonstrated statistical superiority to the individual components netarsudil and latanoprost in decreasing IOP at all time points assessed over 3 months. 2. Nearly twice as many patients receiving FDC achieved at least a 30% reduction from baseline in IOP, as recommended by the American Academy of Ophthalmology for a first-line treatment, compared to the IOP reduction achieved by netarsudil and latanoprost monotherapy. Safety: No new safety signals were identified. Netarsudil/latanoprost FDC was associated with no treatment-related serious adverse events, minimal systemic adverse events, and manageable ocular adverse events.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12325-020-01277-2;4.2;4.6;5.0;;32166538;;;;

For establishing bioequivalence (BE) for amlodipine, valsartan, and atorvastatin, a reference-scaled average BE approach was used if applicable, as well as the conventional limit of 0.80-1.25. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the geometric mean ratios (GMRs) for the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the curve to the last measurable concentration (AUCt) between the FDC and separate formulations were within the 0.80-1.25 limit for all analytes but atorvastatin. The estimated within-subject standard deviation of the log-transformed values of the separate formulations, the reference intervention, was 0.3804 for the Cmax of atorvastatin, being set at 0.7489-1.3352 for the BE acceptance limit. For both the Cmax and AUCt for atorvastatin, the GMRs lay within 0.80-1.25, and the 90%CIs for the GMRs were within the BE acceptance limit. This 3-period replicate crossover study demonstrated the BE of the FDC formulation of amlodipine, valsartan, and atorvastatin and the separate formulations of an amlodipine/valsartan tablet and an atorvastatin tablet. A similar incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was observed in both interventions, and headache was the most common TEAE.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpdd.727;2.4;3.0;3.2;;31373174;;;;

Prolonged ethambutol use is known to cause ocular adverse drug events (ADE). Objectives: To assess the magnitude of ocular ADEs in adult drug sensitive TB patients initiated on daily FDCs and to describe the demographic and clinical profile of patients with ocular ADEs. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving review of RNTCP records of all adult (age >14 years) drug sensitive TB patients initiated on daily FDCs between1st January 2018 and 31st July 2018 in Thiruvananthapuram district, Kerala State, India. Results: 714 patients were initiated on daily FDCs during the study period. It was unknown whether all patients had undergone assessment for ocular ADEs. However, of these 714 patients, 8 patients (1.1%) were documented to have had ocular ADEs. Seven of these 8 patients had received ethambutol more than 15 mg/kg body weight and had developed ocular symptoms (decreased/blurring of vision) 3 months after TB treatment initiation. Ethambutol was stopped in all these 8 patients. In 5 patients it was recorded that ocular ADEs had resolved following stoppage of ethambutol and in the remaining it was unknown. Conclusion: The study confirms the occurrence of ocular ADEs among drug sensitive TB patients on daily FDCs and recommends strengthening of systems for assessing, documenting and managing ocular ADE.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0019570720300378;0.5;0.8;1.0;S0019570720300378;32553315;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0019570720300378;;

Despite significant progress in treatment efficacy, tolerability, and reducing pill burden, new agents are needed to address issues of resistance, drug-drug interactions, end organ disease, and adherence. This review covers novel ART agents recently approved or in development. Recent Findings: Capsid inhibitors (CAI) demonstrate high potency and potential for extended-duration dosing in pre-clinical trials. While previous maturation inhibitors (MI) were hampered by issues of drug resistance, a recent phase IIa trial for a second-generation MI demonstrated promising antiviral activity. A phase I trial to evaluate a transdermal implant of islatravir, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTTI), maintained concentrations above the target pharmacokinetic threshold at 12 weeks. The attachment inhibitor fostemsavir is available in the USA for compassionate use in multi-drug-resistant (MDR) HIV. Summary: New antiretroviral agents show promise for both extended-duration dosing and MDR HIV.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11904-020-00486-2;10.3;0;6.5;;32052271;;;;

Since 2010, patients diagnosed with MDR/RR-TB are being treated with 20–24 months of standardized second-line drugs (SLDs). The profile, management and factors associated with unfavourable treatment outcomes of MDR/RR TB have not been systematically evaluated in Zimbabwe. Objective To assess treatment outcomes and factors associated with unfavourable outcomes among MDR/RR-TB patients registered and treated under the National Tuberculosis Programme in all the district hospitals and urban healthcare facilities in Zimbabwe between January 2010 and December 2015. Methods A cohort study using routinely collected programme data. The ‘death’, ‘loss to follow-up’ (LTFU), ‘failure’ and ‘not evaluated’ were considered as “unfavourable outcome”. A generalized linear model with a log-link and binomial distribution or a Poisson distribution with robust error variances were used to assess factors associated with “unfavourable outcome”. The unadjusted and adjusted relative risks were calculated as a measure of association. A pvalue< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Of the 473 patients in the study, the median age was 34 years [interquartile range, 29–42] and 230 (49%) were males. There were 352 (74%) patients co-infected with HIV, of whom 321 (91%) were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Severe adverse events (SAEs) were recorded in 118 (25%) patients; mostly hearing impairments (70%) and psychosis (11%). Overall, 184 (39%) patients had ‘unfavourable’ treatment outcomes [125 (26%) were deaths, 39 (8%) were lost to follow-up, 4 (<1%) were failures and 16 (3%) not evaluated]. Being co-infected with HIV but not on ART [adjusted relative risk (aRR) = 2.60; 95% CI: 1.33–5.09] was independently associated with unfavourable treatment outcomes. Conclusion The high unfavourable treatment outcomes among MDR/RR-TB patients on standardized SLDs were coupled with a high occurrence of SAEs in this predominantly HIV co-infected cohort. Switching to individualized all oral shorter treatment regimens should be considered to limit SAEs and improve treatment outcomes. Improving the ART uptake and timeliness of ART initiation can reduce unfavourable outcomes.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230848;5.7;5.4;5.2;;32353043;e0230848;;;

Diffusion MRI data were acquired from patients with Parkinson disease (n = 105, of whom 34 were low visual performers and 19 were hallucinators) and age-matched controls (n = 35). We used whole-brain fixel-based analysis to compare microstructural differences in fiber density (FD), macrostructural differences in fiber bundle cross section (FC), and the combined FD and FC (FDC) metric across all white matter fixels. We then performed a tract-of-interest analysis comparing the most sensitive FDC metric across 11 tracts within the visual system.ResultsPatients with Parkinson disease hallucinations exhibited macrostructural changes (reduced FC) within the splenium of the corpus callosum and the left posterior thalamic radiation compared to patients without hallucinations. While there were no significant changes in FD, we found large reductions in the combined FDC metric in Parkinson hallucinators within the splenium (>50% reduction compared to nonhallucinators). Patients with Parkinson disease and low visual performance showed widespread microstructural and macrostructural changes within the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, bilateral posterior thalamic radiations, and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus.ConclusionsWe demonstrate specific white matter tract degeneration affecting posterior thalamic tracts in patients with Parkinson disease with hallucinations and low visual performance, providing direct mechanistic support for attentional models of visual hallucinations.;http://www.neurology.org/lookup/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000009014;11.7;11.4;10.4;;32094242;;;;

Methods: A Markov model was constructed, which included five health states of hypertensive patients who are aged 35–84 years at baseline and free of cardiovascular disease. Clinical data were obtained from a network meta-analysis. Epidemiology data, adverse events (AEs), cost, and utility data were obtained from the literature. The cost associated with AEs was estimated based on the cost of same symptoms of hypertensive patients in an electric medical record database. The model projected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, total costs per patient in a 20-year time horizon, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Probability sensitivity analyses (PSA) and one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted for the main parameters to test the robustness of the model. Results: Compared to olmesartan and amlodipine free combination, amlodipine, and valsartan/amlodipine fixed-dose combination, treatment with olmesartan/amlodipine fixed-dose combination led to fewer CVD events and deaths; resulted in an incremental cost of ¥5,439 ($791.36), ¥6,530 ($950.09), and ¥1,019 ($148.26) and gained additional QALYs of 0.052, 0.094, and 0.037 per patient, respectively. Compared with olmesartan and amlodipine free combination and valsartan/amlodipine fixed-dose combination, olmesartan/amlodipine fixed-dose combination was dominant. Compared with amlodipine alone, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were below the WHO recommended cost-effectiveness threshold, indicating the olmesartan/amlodipine fixed-dose combination was a cost-effective option for hypertensive patients in China. The 10-years’ time horizon scenario analysis showed similar results to the 20-years’ time horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and one-way sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of the model results. Conclusions: Olmesartan/amlodipine fixed-dose combination confers better health outcomes and costs less compared with olmesartan and amlodipine free combination and valsartan/amlodipine fixed-dose combination, and is cost-effective compared to amlodipine for hypertension treatment in China.";https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13696998.2019.1699799;3.5;3.3;3.3;;31782677;;;;

However, TAF is not currently recommended during pregnancy due to limited pharmacokinetic and safety data. TAF, a newer nucleotide phosphonamidate prodrug of tenofovir (TFV), achieves high levels of tenofovir-diphosphate in lymphoid cells and hepatocytes, and 90% lower systemic concentrations of TFV compared to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), thereby maximizing TAF’s antiviral efficacy, potency and clinical safety. Areas covered: This review discusses the currently available information on the pharmacology of TAF in pregnant women living with HIV. Pharmacokinetic studies with TAF during pregnancy have yielded varying results compared to postpartum, but TAF exposures during pregnancy have been within the range of those typically observed in non-pregnant adults. The efficacy and safety of TAF in treatment-naïve pregnant women living with HIV is currently being evaluated in the VESTED study, a phase-III NIH randomized clinical trial. Expert opinion: Initial pregnancy data suggest that TAF-based FDCs have high efficacy and low risk of adverse effects during pregnancy. TAF is likely to become part of first-line regimens for use in pregnant women living with HIV once additional pregnancy data from phase III trials are available.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17425255.2020.1738384;5.7;5.9;6.4;;32125906;;;;

Thus, the verification of the release profile of ART and LUM from FDC ART/LUM tablets using a robust and discriminatory dissolution method is crucial. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and validate an appropriate dissolution method for quality control of FDC ART/LUM tablets. Methods: The dissolution medium was selected based on saturation solubility data and sink conditions. The effect of agitation speed, pH and surfactant concentration on the release of ART and LUM was evaluated by employing a two-level factorial experiment. The resulting final method was validated for linearity, precision, robustness and API stability. In addition, the discriminatory power of the method was evaluated using expired and unexpired FDC ART/LUM products. Results: A suitable dissolution profile of FDC ART/LUM tablets was obtained in 900 ml HCl (0.025 N, pH 1.6) with 1%Myrj 52 using paddle method at 100 rpm and 37 °C. ART and LUM were analysed using a HPLC method with UV detection at wavelengths of 210 and 335 nm, respectively. The results from the stability study showed that ART and LUM were sufficiently stable in HCl (0.025 N, pH 1.6) with 1%Myrj 52 at 37 °C. The method was linear (r2 = 0.999) over the concentration range of 6.25-100 g/ml. The results for precision were within the acceptance limit (%RSD < 2). The percent relative standard deviation (< 2%) and statistically non-significant (p > 0.05) difference in release of ART and LUM observed between deliberately changed dissolution method settings (pH = 1.6 ± 0.2 or agitation speed = 100 ± 2) and optimized dissolution conditions revealed the robustness of the dissolution method. The method was capable to discriminate among different FDC ART/LUM products with different quality. Conclusions: The developed dissolution method is robust and discriminatory. It can be used in the quality evaluation of FDC ART/LUM tablets.;https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-020-03209-5;5.1;4.9;5.0;;32264882;139;;;

Methods: We report three clinical phase I studies designed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the FDC of ibuprofen/acetaminophen 250/500 mg (administered as two tablets of ibuprofen 125 mg/acetaminophen 250 mg) in comparison with its individual components administered alone or together, and to determine the effect of food on the PK of the FDC. Two studies in healthy adults aged 18–55 years used a crossover design in which subjects received a single dose of each treatment with a 2-day washout period between each. In the third study, the bioavailability of ibuprofen and acetaminophen from a single oral dose of the FDC was assessed in healthy adolescents aged 12–17 years, inclusive. Results: A total of 35 and 46 subjects were enrolled in the two adult studies, respectively, and 21 were enrolled in the adolescent study. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen in the FDC were bioequivalent to the monocomponents administered alone or together. With food, the maximum concentration (Cmax) for ibuprofen and acetaminophen from the FDC was reduced by 36% and 37%, respectively, and time to Cmax (i.e. tmax) was delayed. Overall drug exposure to ibuprofen or acetaminophen in the fed versus fasted states was similar. In adolescents, overall exposure to acetaminophen and ibuprofen was comparable with that in adults, with a slightly higher overall exposure to ibuprofen. Exposure to acetaminophen and ibuprofen in adolescents aged 12–14 years was slightly higher versus those aged 15–17 years. Adverse events were similar across all treatment groups. Conclusions: The FDC of ibuprofen/acetaminophen 250/500 mg has a PK profile similar to its monocomponent constituents when administered separately or coadministered, indicating no drug–drug interactions and no formulation effects. Similar to previous findings for the individual components, the rates of absorption of ibuprofen and acetaminophen from the FDC were slightly delayed in the presence of food. Overall, adolescents had similar exposures to acetaminophen and ibuprofen as adults, while younger adolescents had slightly greater exposure than older adolescents, probably due to their smaller body size. The FDC was generally well tolerated.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40268-020-00293-5;3.2;4.5;4.2;;32130679;;;;

Methods: Demographics, cllnlco-ettologlcal profile and quality of life (QoL) of adult patients with dry cough, prescribed with the FDC of codeine phosphate and triprolidine hydrochlorldewere determined. Standard tools were used for measuring effectiveness and safety during the study. Results: Out of 222 (100.0%) patients, mo staged either 55 years (31.08%) or 18-35 years (30.18%). Etiology of dry cough presented by more than 20% patients were allergy (43%), environmental factors (25.23%), and respiratory tract Infection (23.42%). Significant (p<0.0001) reduction in the mean score of cough frequency, cough severlty, and sleep disruption was evident at end of treatment. Approximately 97% patients achieved minimal important differencein a mean (±SD) duration of 5.0 (±0.27) days. Improvement in QoL of patients was also reported with no adverse drug reaction during the study. Conclusion: In Indian set-up, dry cough was demonstrated equally by both the genders with primary presentation among elderly and young adults.

Methods: Patients switching to E/C/F/TAF between March and July 2018 were included. Weight, lipid profile (triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels at 48 weeks before and after the switch were analyzed using generalized estimating equations in order to identify the associated factors. Results: A total of 693 patients were included, and a weight gain was noted after the switch at weeks 12 (mean +0.63 kg), 24 (+1.25), 36 (+1.58), and 48 (+1.75) (all p < 0.0001). The weight change after the switch was significantly greater than that observed within the preceding 48-week period before the switch (+1.75 kg vs +0.54, p < 0.0001) and was correlated with switch to E/C/F/TAF (coefficient 0.29), later clinic visit (0.15), baseline weight (0.99), diabetes mellitus (coefficient 0.96), and age (0.02) (all p < 0.01). At week 48, significant increases were observed for TG (mean +62.93 mg/dl), TC (+22.30), LDL-C (+9.70), HDL-C (+3.65) (all p < 0.01), and HbA1c (+0.08%) (p < 0.05), but not TC/HDL-C ratio (+0.12, p = 0.38). Conclusions: Virally suppressed HIV-positive patients gained a moderate amount of weight and had significant increases in lipid levels after switching to E/C/F/TAF.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1201971219305028;5.3;5.6;5.3;S1201971219305028;31884172;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1201971219305028;;

Method:: Trends in European Medicine Agency (EMA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals of FDC products for the 3 scenarios were explored by comparing the therapeutic indications retrieved from the EMA and FDA websites for FDCs approved between January 2000 and April 2017 within 5 selected therapeutic areas: type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Result:: Approval decisions between EMA and FDA were largely aligned for the substitution therapy and add-on therapy scenarios. Discrepancies were found for the initial combination therapy scenario. Conclusion:: Since EMA and FDA rely on similar conceptional models when approving FDCs, the reasons behind this general disparity are not clear, but may be found in the lack of evidence from the registration studies. Sponsors and health authorities should work collaboratively on closing that gap.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s43441-019-00057-7;1.5;1.6;1.7;;32072578;;;;

Coronary artery disease (CAD) events have been associated with certain antiretroviral therapy (ART) agents. In contrast, the influence of ART on subclinical atherosclerosis is not clear. The study objective was to assess the association between individual ART agents and the prevalence and extent of subclinical CAD. Methods. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) were performed in 45-year-old Swiss Human Immunodeficiency Virus Cohort Study participants. The following subclinical CAD endpoints were analyzed separately: CAC score >0, any plaque, calcified plaque, noncalcified/mixed plaque, segment involvement score (SIS), and segment severity score (SSS). Logistic regression models calculated by inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) were used to explore associations between subclinical CAD and cumulative exposure to the 10 most frequently used drugs. Results. There were 403 patients who underwent CCTA. A CAC score >0 was recorded in 188 (47%), any plaque in 214 (53%), calcified plaque in 151 (38%), and noncalcified/mixed plaque in 150 (37%) participants. A CAC score >0 was negatively associated with efavirenz (IPTW adjusted odds ratio per 5 years 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-0.96), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (0.68, 95% CI 0.49-0.95), and lopinavir (0.64, 95% CI 0.43-0.96). Any plaque was negatively associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (0.71, 95% CI 0.51-0.99). Calcified plaque was negatively associated with efavirenz (0.7, 95% CI 0.57-0.97). Noncalcified/ mixed plaque was positively associated with abacavir (1.46, 95% CI 1.08-1.98) and negatively associated with emtricitabine (0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.99). For SSS and SIS, we found no association with any drug. Conclusions. An increased risk of noncalcified/mixed plaque was only found in patients exposed to abacavir. Emtricitabine was negatively associated with noncalcified/mixed plaque, while tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and efavirenz were negatively associated with any plaque and calcified plaque, respectively.;https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciz283/5432300;14.0;13.8;12.5;;30958888;;;;

All rights reserved.Background:Little is known about the proportion of HIV-positive clients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) who meet stability criteria for differentiated service delivery (DSD) models. We report the proportion of ART clients meeting stability criteria as part of screening for a randomized trial of multimonth dispensing in Malawi and Zambia.Methods:For a DSD trial now underway, we screened HIV-positive clients aged at least 18 years presenting for HIV treatment in 30 adult ART clinics in Malawi and Zambia to determine eligibility for DSD. Stability was defined as on first-line ART (efavirenz/tenofovir/lamivudine) for at least 6 months, no ART side effects, no toxicity or infectious complications, no noncommunicable diseases being treated in ART clinic, no lapses in ART adherence in the prior 6 months (>30 days without taking ART), and if female, not pregnant or breastfeeding.Results:In total, 3465 adult ART clients were approached between 10 May 2017 and 30 April 2018 (Malawi: 1680; Zambia: 1785). Of the 2938 who answered screening questions (Malawi: 1527; Zambia: 1411), 2173 (73.5%) met criteria for DSD eligibility (Malawi: 72.8%; Zambia: 74.3%). The most common reasons for ineligibility were being on ART less than 6 months (9.6%) and a regimen other than standard first-line (7.9%).Conclusion:Approximately three-quarters of all adult clients presenting at ART clinics in Malawi and Zambia were eligible for DSD using a typical definition of stability. High uptake of DSD models by eligible clients would have a major impact on the infrastructure and the allocation of HIV treatment resources.";http://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAD.0000000000002435;8.8;7.1;7.5;;31764076;;;;

All right reserved.The effects of nano-magnesium hydroxide and common magnesium hydroxide (100, 200, and 300 mg•kg-1) on the forms of cadmium in different types of cadmium contaminated soils (1, 5, 10, and 15 mg•kg-1) were studied under 28 days of continuous culture experiment. In the neutral soil, during the 28 days of culture, soil exchange Cd (EX-Cd) form distribution ratio (FDC) decreased at first and then increased with the culture time increasing under treatment of 1, 5, 10, and 15 mg•kg-1 Cd. The minima of soil EX-Cd FDC were found on the 14th day under 1 mg•kg-1 Cd and 5 mg•kg-1 Cd treatments, whereas the minima of soil EX-Cd FDC were observed on the 4th day under 10 mg•kg-1 Cd and 15 mg•kg-1 Cd treatments. The FDC of soil carbonate bound Cd (CAB-Cd), iron manganese oxidized Cd (FeMn-Cd), and organic bound Cd (OM-Cd) increased at first, then decreased, and finally, became stable, and the maxima of soil CAB-Cd, FeMn-Cd, and OM-Cd FDC were found on the 4th day, whereas the minima of soil CAB-Cd, FeMn-Cd, and OM-Cd FDC were observed on the 14th day. Soil residual Cd (RES-Cd) FDC increased gradually and then tended to becomes stable during the 28 days of culture. The soil EX-Cd FDC was 66.7%-81.8% at 1, 5, 10, and 15 mg•kg-1 Cd treatments, which was the main form of the soil. The FDC of soil Cd forms was in the order of EX-Cd >CAB-Cd >RES-Cd >FeMn-Cd >OM-Cd. Soil EX-Cd FDC reached the lowest value on the 14th Day. Soil EX-Cd FDC was reduced by nano-magnesium hydroxide and common magnesium hydroxide, and it decreased with the increase of the amount of magnesium hydroxide. During 0-28 days of culture, the soil EX-Cd FDC decreased by 11.4%-67.7%, 7.8%-37.2%, 7.7%-36.4%, 5.0%-28.8% (nano-magnesium hydroxide) and 0.5%-49.5%, 0.6%-15.0%, 1.0%-18.1%, 0.7%-14.6% (ordinary magnesium hydroxide) at 1, 5, 10, and 15 mg•kg-1 Cd treatments, respectively. The EX-Cd content of alkaline soil reached the lowest value on the 7th day of culture, and the EX-Cd content of acidic soil reached the lowest value on the 21st day under 1, 5, and 10 mg•kg-1 Cd treatments. The content of EX-Cd in neutral, acidic, and alkaline soils decreased with the increase of magnesium hydroxide content, and the content of EX-Cd in soil decreased with the increase of magnesium hydroxide amount. At the same amount, the effect of passivating soil EX-Cd under nanometer magnesium hydroxide treatment was superior to ordinary magnesium hydroxide treatment.;http://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?doi=10.13227/j.hjkx.201910135;1.0;1.5;1.9;;32608698;;;;

Materials and methods: Various formulations which is used for asthma mentioned in Current Index of Medical Specialities (CIMS) (2018) were noted down. Their rationality and irrational combination of drug preparations were recorded as per Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) (2018). Moreover they are classified into number of ingredients present in each preparation, type of dosage forms, different pharmacological groups to which they belong and cost analysis of the anti-asthmatic preparations. Results: Among 598 preparations which has been analysed, 360 (60%) were fixed dose combinations (FDC). Out of 360 FDC, 250(42%) preparations were of irrational formulations. Preparations were categorised into different pharmacological groups like expectorants (18.73%), antihistamines (17.22%), beta 2 adrenergic agonists (50.17%), mucolytics (20.57%), cromones (1%), methylxanthines (16.38%), corticosteroids (24.08%), antileukotrienes (23.91%), anticholinergics (3.85%).187 preparations were inhalants and 10 of the preparations were nasal formulations. Solid formulations (244) are more when compared to other formulations and liquid oral formulations are costlier. Conclusion: Many of the drugs which was considered as irrational by DCGI is still available in Indian market and it is widely used by the people. This indicates the poor governance in the pharmaceutical sector. Through proper awareness and education to the pharmacist, physician and patient this problem could be solved. Moreover it also leads to the wasteful expenditure and effectiveness of the drug is also questionable.;http://www.indianjournals.com/ijor.aspx?target=ijor:rjpt&volume=13&issue=2&article=022;0.2;0.4;0.5;;;;;;

In this study, the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of gemigliptin and metformin were compared between FDC and the corresponding loose combination under fasted and fed states. A two-part, randomized, open label, single-dose, two-way crossover study was conducted in healthy male subjects. Under fasted (part 1) or fed (part 2) state, 2 FDC tablets of gemigliptin/ metformin sustained release (SR) 25/500 mg or loose combination with one tablet of gemigliptin 50 mg and two tablets of metformin extended release (XR) 500 mg were orally administered in each period with a 7-day washout. Serial blood samples were collected up to 48 hours to determine the drug concentration and the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) activity. The concentration-time profiles of gemigliptin and metformin were similar between FDC and loose combination in both the fasted and fed states. Geometric mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals of FDC to loose combination for area under the concentration-time curve and maximum plasma concentration of gemigliptin and metformin were within the bioequivalence range (0.8–1.25) in both states. DPP-4 activity-time profiles of FDC were comparable to that of the loose combination, showing similar area under the DPP-4 inhibition-time curve and maximum DPP-4 inhibition between FDC and loose combination, regardless of the fasted or fed state. In conclusion, the PK/PD characteristics of gemigliptin and metformin were similar in FDC tablets and loose combination both in fasted and fed states.;https://tcpharm.org/DOIx.php?id=10.12793/tcp.2020.28.e2;0.3;0.3;0.5;;;;;;

Longitudinal exposure-response (LER) analysis utilizes the time course of the data and is valid for several clinical endpoints for FDCs. The aim of the study was to investigate if LER is applicable for the validation of FDCs by demonstrating the contribution of each component to the overall effect without inflation of FP rates. FP and FN rates associated with ER and LER analysis were investigated using stochastic simulation and estimation. Four hundred thirty-two scenarios with varying numbers of patients, duration, sampling frequency, dose distribution, design, and drug activity were analyzed using a range of linear, log-linear, and non-linear models to asses FP and FN rates. Lastly, the impact of the clinical trial parameters was investigated. LER analyses provided well-controlled FP rates of the expected 5% or less; however, in low information clinical trials consisting of 30 patients, 4 samples, and 20 days, LER analyses lead to inflated FN rates. Parameter investigation showed that when the clinical trial includes sufficient patients, duration, samples, and an appropriate trial design, the FN rates are in general below the expected 5% for LER analysis. Based on the results, LER analysis can be used for the validation of FDCs and fixed ratio drug combinations. The method constitutes a new avenue for providing evidence that demonstrates the contribution of each component to the overall clinical effect.";http://link.springer.com/10.1208/s12248-020-0414-y;6.1;7.0;6.8;;31989328;32;;;

This prospective, open-label, non-comparative, observational, 24-week multicentre study is the first real-world study from India to compare the efficacy and safety of fixed-dose combination of fluticasone/formoterol (Maxiflo® 100/6 mcg or 250/6 mcg) capsules via the Revolizer® device in patients with persistent asthma. The primary efficacy analyses included mean change in Asthma Control Test (ACT™) at 4, 8, 16 and 24 weeks. Secondary efficacy analyses included mean change in morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at the end of 4, 8, 16 and 24 weeks, number of patients having symptom-free days and nights at the end of 4, 8, 16 and 24 weeks, the number and severity of exacerbations over 24 weeks and response to the Usability Preference Satisfaction Confidence questionnaire after 1 week. Overall, 385 (of 401; 96.01%) enrolled patients completed the study. The mean change in ACT™ score was 6.7 ± 3.71 (95% CI: 6.32, 7.06; p < 0.0001) at week 24. The ACT™ score at weeks 4, 8 and 16 showed progressive and statistically significant increase from baseline. A statistically significant improvement in morning and evening PEFR at weeks 4, 8, 16 and 24 was reported. The proportion of patients experiencing symptom-free days and nights continuously increased from baseline to week 24. A good safety profile over the 24-week period was observed.

However, it has been reported that ibuprofen can have deleterious and unpredictable side effects at both therapeutic and toxic doses. Herein we report a case of an ibuprofen-induced fixed drug eruption (FDE). Clinical details: A 35-year-old female underwent surgery for anal fissures at a secondary care hospital in India. After surgery, the patient was prescribed ibuprofen 400 mg, t.i.d., for 7 days. On Day 3, the patient complained of a burning sensation, discoloration of the lips and ulcers in the oral cavity. Based on the presenting signs and symptoms, she was diagnosed as experiencing an ibuprofen-induced FDE. Outcome: Symptoms improved significantly after withdrawal of ibuprofen. The patient was treated with intravenous fluids, prednisolone 40 mg oral tablets and levocetirizine 20 mg. A causality assessment of the reaction was undertaken, indicating a probable relationship between the patient's symptoms and her use of ibuprofen. Conclusion: This report highlights the importance of regular monitoring for adverse drug reactions due to ibuprofen because it is likely to cause an FDE.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jppr.1530;0.6;0.5;0.7;;;;;;

All right reserved.To locate all local optimum of the black box function, such as the simulation function, a method based on fitness landscape analysis is proposed. Firstly, the fitness distance correlation (FDC) is modified according to the characteristics of our problem, and the relationship between the modified FDC and the roughness grade of the fitness landscape is explored. Based on the relationship, an FDC based repeated split region method (FRSR) is designed to breakdown the whole feasible region into several acceptable sub-regions according to the FDC value, and a certain number of initial search points are assigned in each sub-region based on the FDC value of the sub-region, followed by an optimization procedure using the pattern search algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method can locate all local optimum with feuer initial points, and comparison study shows that it performs better than traditional methods, such as the uniformly generating initial points method and other known methods, both in speed and in quality of the solution.;http://www.sys-ele.com/CN/10.3969/j.issn.1001-506X.2020.02.13;0.8;0.9;1.0;;;;;;

With a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)-guided strategy, we assessed the effectiveness of half-a-tablet EFV plus 2 nucleos(t)ide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in HIV-infected Taiwanese who had achieved viral suppression with full-dose (600 mg) EFV. Methods: HIV-infected adults receiving EFV-containing regimens who had plasma mid-dose EFV concentration (C12) 2.0 mg/L and had plasma HIV RNA load (PVL) <200 copies/mL were enrolled in this single-arm, open-label study by reducing EFV to half-a-tablet daily. The primary endpoint was PVL <50 copies/ml in an intention-to-treat (ITT) population at week 48. The secondary endpoints were the plasma EFV C12, the proportion of patients with plasma EFV C12 <1.0 mg/L, PVL <50 copies/ml at week 96 and week 144. Results: Between April 2013 and September 2016, 203 patients (93.6% male; median age, 39.0 years) were enrolled. The median EFV C12 before switch was 2.80 mg/L (interquartile range (IQR), 2.41–3.73), which decreased to 1.59 mg/L (IQR, 1.23–2.03) after switch with a reduction of 47.4% (IQR, 38.3–55.5%). In ITT analysis, 93.6%, 92.3% and 87.3% of the patients achieved PVL <50 copies/ml at weeks 48, 96 and 144, respectively. More than 70% of the patients reported alleviation of EFV-associated adverse effects following the switch.

In this cohort study using a 10% random sample of dispensing claims data for eligible Australians, we identified 2042 people dispensed cART between January 2016 and December 2017 (mean age 48.0 ± 12.0 years old, 88.6% male, and 85.9% treatment experienced). We considered people to be adherent if the proportion of treatment coverage days was 80% in the 360 days after their first observed cART dispensing. We also used group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) to examine different patterns of adherence for 360 days from first observed cART dispensing. Most commonly, people receiving cART were treated with two nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors with an integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI - 46.6%). Overall, 1708 people [83.6% (95% confidential interval 82.0-85.3%)] remained adherent over 360 days. GBTM identified three distinct adherence patterns: nearly always adherent [67.8% (63.7-71.9%) of the cohort], moderate adherence [26.6% (23.0-30.1%)], and low adherence [5.6% (4.1-7.2%)]. People were more likely to belong to the ""nearly always adherent"" trajectory if they were older (per additional year of age), treated with an INSTI regimen, and on treatment for more than 6 months. Our study demonstrates that the 360-day adherence to cART is generally high, but approximately one-third maintain a moderate or low adherence pattern. The use of INSTI regimens and additional support of treatment adherence, especially among younger people and those initiating therapy, may further improve adherence.";https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/apc.2019.0278;6.2;6.6;6.0;;32049558;;;;

Methods: All pregnant females who were tested and found positive for HIV from April 2015 to March 2017 were included in this study and started on TLE regimen (Tenofovir 300 mg, Lamivudine 300 mg, Efavirenz 600 mg). After delivery these newborns were given syrup Nevirapine 2 mg/kg for 6 weeks of life if mother was started on ART before 12 weeks of gestation and was continued upto 12 weeks if mother was started on ART later than 12 weeks of gestation. Infants were tested with PCR and Rapid test for HIV was done at 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months of life. Result: Out of 66 HIV-positive mothers (26 diagnosed in our institute and 40 referred patients), 53 delivered in our hospital. Out of these 53 deliveries, 3 were stillbirth, so 50 babies were registered. Out of 50 registered babies, 2 babies died in follow-up (one at the age of 12 months due to malnutrition and other at the age of 4 months due to diarrhea). Five babies were referred to nearby ART centers. So, we followed 43 babies out of which two were found to be positive for HIV (transmission rate of HIV was 4.6%). Conclusion: The risk of transmission of HIV from mother-to-child had declined with the use of combination ART, and the emergence of drug resistance was reduced.

Despite limitations in the number of available free antiretroviral drugs, the overall mortality associated with HIV/AIDS has dropped from 39.3 per 100 person-years in 2002 to 3.1 in 2014. In this review, we summarize the challenges, responses, and achievements of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in China over the past 20 years. Recent Findings: Continuous optimization of the Chinese National Guidelines for HIV/AIDS Diagnosis and Treatment has been guided by data from serial domestic multi-center studies aimed at evaluating efficacy and toxicity of available ART regimens among Chinese patients with HIV, with the goal of maximizing adherence, access, and efficacy. In addition, increasing attention has been focused on the importance of continuity in the HIV care cascade to promote linkage to care, and address the multidisciplinary chronic care needs HIV/AIDS patients on lifelong ART. Summary: Great progress has been achieved in the past 20 years in terms of access to and optimization of antiretroviral treatment in China. As the number of patients receiving long-term ART continues to grow, the focus of HIV/AIDS treatment has gradually transitioned from urgent care to the management of non-AIDS-related chronic complications and control of chronic inflammation.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11904-019-00478-x;10.3;0;6.5;;31939111;;;;

Methods: Based on the Program of Screening and Intervention Subjects with High Risk Cardiovascular Diseases, this study presented information on adults aged 35-75 in Southwest China by convenient sampling method, from January 2016 to November 2018. Basic information and cardiovascular related data were collected. Data on hypertensive patients were recorded, including names, doses and frequency of anti-hypertensive drugs they used. Information on the use of anti-hypertensive drugs among different hypertension subgroups, potential related characteristics, types and combination patterns of drugs, etc., were analyzed. Results: A total of 394 957 subjects were included in the study, with 159 014 identified as being hypertensive [mean age (58.8±9.5) years, 40.2% male]. 29.8% of them ever received antihypertensive drugs. A total of 30 445 of the patients reported detailed information of the drugs they ever used and 22.5% of them received therapy of combined drugs. Rates of using combination therapy were consistent among subgroups with different age, gender, blood pressure level and history of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Results from the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that patients with previous cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, obesity or diabetes were more likely to have received combined therapy, while patients with less education or lower income were in the opposite. Calcium antagonists (58.6%) were the main drugs being used in single drug therapy, while traditional fixed-dose combination drugs (31.4%) were the most common ones in the drug-combination therapy, followed by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker combined with calcium antagonists (22.4%). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker combined with beta blocker was the main drug used in patients with coronary heart disease. Conclusions: Treatment programs using the antihypertensive drugs for hypertensive patients in Southwest China needs to be improved, since the irrational use of antihypertensive drugs still exists. However, we would encourage the use of combination therapy for hypertensive patients.";http://journal.yiigle.com/LinkIn.do?linkin_type=DOI&DOI=10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20190627-00472;0.8;0;0;;32344475;;;;

However, it remains unknown the effect of early ART on plasma anti-CD4 autoantibody levels in acute HIV infection (AHI). Methods: In this cohort study, we evaluated the effect of early and delayed initiation of ART on plasma anti-CD4 autoantibody levels in AHI individuals (n = 90). Blood samples were collected from men who had sex with men (MSM) with acute infection, pre-ART, and 4, 24, 48, and 96 weeks after ART. Plasma levels of anti-CD4 immunoglobulin G (IgG) were measured by ELISA. Results: We found that plasma anti-CD4 IgG levels were significantly increased in AHI individuals compared with healthy controls (HCs) prior to ART. Notably, early ART decreased plasma anti-CD4 IgG to the levels similar to HCs starting at 24 weeks (W). However, delayed initiation of ART did not significantly reduce plasma anti-CD4 IgG levels in AHI individuals. Moreover, the peripheral CD4+ T-cell counts were inversely correlated with plasma anti-CD4 IgG levels in AHI individuals at 48 and 96 W after early ART but not after delayed ART. Conclusions: Taken together, our findings demonstrate for the first time that early ART, but not delayed initiation of ART, is effective in influencing anti-CD4 autoantibody production and recovering CD4+ T-cell counts in AHI individuals.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fphar.2020.00449/full;4.7;3.9;5.0;;;449;;;

Although histoplasmosis has a worldwide distribution, histoplasmosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) is rarely reported. This study aimed to describe the incidence and features of histoplasmosis-associated IRIS in a cohort of PLHIV. Methods: A retrospective multicenter study was conducted in French Guiana from 1 January 1997 to 30 September 2017. The target population was represented by PLHIV who presented an episode of histoplasmosis within 6 months after antiretroviral therapy initiation. We used a consensual IRIS case definition, submitted to the agreement of 2 experts. Each case was described using a standardized questionnaire, and all patients gave informed consent. Results: Twenty-two cases of histoplasmosis-associated IRIS were included (14 infectious/unmasking and 8 paradoxical), with an overall incidence rate of 0.74 cases per 1000 HIV-infected person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.43-1.05). Mean age was 40.5 years. The ratio of males to females was 1:4. Median time to IRIS was 11 days (interquartile range 7-40 days) after antiretroviral therapy initiation. The main clinical presentation was fever, without any specific pattern, and disseminated disease. We reported 2 severe cases and partial or complete recovery at 1 month was the rule. Twenty-two cases were identified in the literature with similar characteristics. Conclusions: Histoplasmosis-associated IRIS incidence was low but generated significant morbidity in PLHIV. In endemic areas, screening for latent or subclinical histoplasmosis should be implemented before antiretroviral therapy initiation.;https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciz247/5421706;14.0;13.8;12.5;;30921453;;;;

Depression is one of the most important predictors of poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Little has been done to develop integrated interventions that are feasible and appropriate for task-shifting to nonspecialists that seek to address both depression and barriers to ART adherence in Sub-Saharan Africa. This case series describes an integrated intervention for depression and ART adherence delivered by a lay adherence counselor and supervised by a local psychologist. The 6-session intervention was based on problem-solving therapy for depression and for barriers to adherence (PST-AD), with stepped care for those whose depression did not recover with PST-AD. Primary outcomes were acceptability and depression. Acceptability was measured by participant attendance to the 6 sessions. Three case studies illustrate the structured intervention, solutions identified to adherence barriers and to problems underlying low mood, and changes seen in the participant's psychological symptoms. Acceptability of the intervention was high and common mental disorder symptoms scores measured using the SRQ-8 decreased overall. An integrated intervention for depression and adherence to ART appeared feasible in this low-income setting. An RCT of the intervention versus an appropriate comparison condition is needed to evaluate clinical and cost-effectiveness.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1077722918301032;4.9;4.9;3.9;S1077722918301032;;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1077722918301032;;

This new formulation must contain the lowest number of excipients accepted for pediatrics and fulfill all the pharmacopeia requirements. Significance: At present, there is no adequate market dosage form available for children. There is, however, one in a prequalification phase by the World Health Organization but its composition contains excipients which may not be suitable for pediatrics. Therefore, this new formulation would cover this therapeutic gap. Methods: A factorial design, based on three quantitative factors (compression force and concentration of AcDiSol® and Explosol®) at three levels each, was performed to elucidate their influence over disintegration time and friability. In addition, the influence of the press speed on disintegration time, friability, tensile strength, fineness of dispersion and content uniformity over the target tablet was tested. A stability test was done following ICH guideline for accelerated conditions. Results: Tablets developed with 9% w/w of Explosol® and a compression force of 16 kN disintegrated in less than 3 min and showed a friability below 1% when 15-mm punches were used. The tableting process could be done up to 25 and 50 cycles/minute ensuring good quality attributes when 15 and 12-mm punches were used, respectively. All APIs remained inside the limit of ± 5% of drug content till 6 months of storage. Conclusion: A high-quality child-friendly FDC water-dispersible tablet was developed improving the treatment of TB in pediatric.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03639045.2020.1717516;3.8;4.0;4.2;;31944867;;;;

Recently added to the therapeutic armamentarium are fixed-dose combinations (FDC) of two long acting bronchodilators. LAMAs (long acting muscarinic antagonists) and LABAs (long acting beta agonists) are the main classes available and use different pathways to effectively produce bronchial smooth muscle relaxation. Areas covered: The most recent inhaled FDC LAMA/LABA to come to market is Aclidinium Bromide and Formoterol Fumarate. We searched databases of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and manufacturers’ websites and retrieved all the randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) conducted with these drugs up to September 2019. Expert opinion: It is likely that FDCs will become the core of our COPD pharmacotherapy for all but the mildest COPD patients. These individual drugs have excellent efficacy and safety records for the maintenance treatment of COPD. Studies have demonstrated that twice daily treatment with aclidinium/formoterol resulted in significant improvement in lung function and an improved exercise tolerance when compared to placebo. Adverse effects are within the range of what is seen with other LAMA/LABA combinations.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17512433.2020.1717334;4.1;4.2;5.1;;31951778;;;;

The increased drug resistance and constant viral replication have been the trigger for important studies regarding the use of nanotechnology in antiviral therapies. Nanomaterials offer unique physico-chemical properties that have linked benefits for drug delivery as ideal tools for viral treatment. Currently, different types of nanomaterials namely nanoparticles, liposomes, nanospheres, nanogels, nanosuspensions and nanoemulsions were studied either in vitro or in vivo for drug delivery of antiviral agents with prospects to be translated in clinical practice. This review highlights the drug delivery nanosystems incorporating the major antiviral classes and their transport across specific barriers at cellular and intracellular level. Important reflections on nanomedicines currently approved or undergoing investigations for the treatment of viral infections are also discussed. Finally, the authors present an overview on the requirements for the design of antiviral nanotherapeutics.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/12/2/171;5.2;2.9;2.9;;;171;;;

In this study, a simple FDC model is developed for monthly streamflow data. The model consists of several steps including the nondimensionalization and then normalization in case the monthly streamflow data do not fit the normal probability distribution function. The normalized quantiles are calculated after which a back transformation is applied to the normalized quantiles to return back to the original dimensional streamflow data. In order to calculate annual streamflow of the river basin, an empirical regression equation is proposed using the drainage area and the annual total precipitation only as the input. As the final step of the model, dimensional quantiles of FDC are calculated. Ceyhan River basin in southern Turkey is chosen for the case study. Forty-two streamflow gauging stations are considered; two thirds of the gauging stations are used for the model calibration, and one third for validation. The modeled FDCs are compared to the observation and assessed with a number of performance metrics. They are found similar to the observed ones with a relatively good performance; they are good in the mid and high flow parts particularly while the low flow part of FDCs might require further detailed analysis.";https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/12/2/338;2.4;2.6;3.0;;;338;;;

However, data are lacking regarding their efficacy and safety in HIV/HCV-genotype (GT) 4-coinfected patients. Methods: A single-centre, prospective study including HIV/HCV-GT 4-coinfected patients who were treated with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir (SOF/DCV) was conducted for 12 wk. Sustained virological response (SVR) at week 12 post-treatment (SVR12), adverse events (AEs) and changes in liver stiffness measurement (LSM) at SVR12 in comparison with baseline were evaluated. Results: SVR12 was achieved in 46 of 50 patients (92%). No significant difference in SVR12 was noticed among patients who received antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens compared with those who did not receive ART regimens or between those with insignificant fibrosis (<F2) and those with significant fibrosis (F2) (p=0.9 and p=0.3, respectively). AEs occurred in 45 (90%) patients. The most frequent AEs were fatigue, headache and nausea. No treatment-related serious AEs or deaths were reported. HIV control was not compromised. LSM, fibrosis 4 score and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index showed a significant decrease at SVR12 when compared with baseline (p=0.0004, p=0.0003 and p<0.0001, respectively). Logistic regression analysis showed no association between baseline variables and SVR12 while significant fibrosis (F2) was the only baseline variable that was significantly associated with improvement of LSM at SVR12. Conclusion: SOF/DCV achieved a high SVR12 and was well-tolerated in HIV/HCV-GT 4-coinfected patients.;https://academic.oup.com/trstmh/article/114/4/232/5699686;4.2;3.6;2.4;;31925434;;;;

Two catchments namely Tamansari catchment (16.4 Ha) and Penanggungan catchment (3.6 Ha), both are located in Banjarnegara district, Central Java, Indonesia, were studied. Based on drone mapping, the dominant land use of the Tamansari catchment was agroforestry where trees were combined with seasonal crops like cabbage, potatoes and carrots on the same unit of land, whereas the dominant land use of the Penanggungan was seasonal crops without any trees. For both catchments, meteorological data and discharge data were available from May 2017 to March 2018, so that made it possible to compare each other. Furthermore, the hydrological responses of the two catchments were compared for their water balance and the annual, seasonal and monthly Flow Duration Curves (FDC). The results showed that both catchments had their lowest rainfall in August and their highest rainfall in February. Based on the FDC, the Tamansari generally had a steadier flow and the range of discharge values was smaller than the Penanggungan, especially on February, the wettest month of the year. In the drier periods, the two catchments behave similarly, but in general, the Tamansari produced more discharge than the Penanggungan. Finally, based on the observation, it can generally conclude that a micro catchment mostly occupied with seasonal crops like in the Penanggungan catchment reacted more extreme to rainfall than a micro catchment mostly occupied with combined trees and seasonal crops in form of agroforestry like in the Tamansari catchment.;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/449/1/012037;0.3;0.3;0.4;;;012037;;;

The FDC framework utilizes forward dynamic robot simulation and an impedance controller to solve the inverse kinematics problem. For the practical use of the proposed control framework, the accuracy, robustness, and stability of robot motion are considered. Taking advantage of the stability of the implicit Euler method, a high-gain PD controller enables accurate end-effector pose tracking in the task space without losing stability even near the kinematic singularities. Also, the robustness of the controller is enhanced by borrowing the structure of the nonlinear robust internal-loop compensator. Lastly, the selective joint damping injection and spring force saturation are applied to the impedance controller so that the robot motion can always stay within the given dynamic constraints. This study suggests a new, effective solution for the kinematic singularity problem of non-redundant robot manipulators.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8954829/;0;3.7;6.3;;;8954829;;;

However, in some remote settings, access to viral load monitoring is still complex due to logistical and financial constraints. Use of dried blood spots (DBS) for blood collection could overcome these difficulties. This study aims to describe feasibility and operability of DBS use for routine viral load monitoring. Methods From June 2017 to April 2018, HIV-infected adults who initiated ART were enrolled in a prospective cohort in 43 clinical sites across 6 provinces in North Vietnam. Following national guidelines, the first viral load monitoring was planned 6 months after ART initiation. DBS were collected at the clinical site and sent by post to a central laboratory in Hanoi for viral load measurement. Results Of the 578 patients enrolled, 537 were still followed 6 months after ART initiation, of which DBS was collected for 397 (73.9%). The median (inter quartile range) delay between DBS collection at site level and reception at the central laboratory was 8 (6-19) days and for 70.0% viral load was measured 30 days after blood collection. The proportion of patients with viral load 1000 copies/mL at the 6 month evaluation was 15.9% (n = 59). Of these, a DBS was collected again to confirm virological failure in 15 (24.4%) of which virological failure was confirmed in 11 (73.3%). Conclusion Delay of DBS transfer to the central laboratory was acceptable and most viral loads were measured in 30 days, in-line with routine follow-up. However, the level of DBS coverage and the proportion of patients in failure for whom a confirmatory viral load was available were suboptimal, indicating that integration of viral load monitoring in the field requires, among other things, careful training and strong involvement of the local teams. The proportion of patients experiencing virological failure was in line with other reports; interestingly those who reported being non-adherent and those with a low BMI were more at risk of failure.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230968;5.7;5.4;5.2;;32271796;e0230968;;;

The efficacy and safety of dolutegravir (DTG) were assessed in adults with HIV and drug-susceptible tuberculosis. Methods: International Study of Patients with HIV on Rifampicin ING is a noncomparative, active-control, randomized, open-label study in HIV-1-infected antiretroviral therapy-naive adults (CD4+ 50 cells/mm3). Participants on rifampicin-based tuberculosis treatment 8 weeks were randomized (3:2) to receive DTG (50 mg twice daily both during and 2 weeks after tuberculosis therapy, then 50 mg once daily) or efavirenz (EFV; 600 mg daily) with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of DTG-arm participants with plasma HIV-1-RNA <50 copies/mL (responders) by the Food and Drug Administration Snapshot algorithm (intent-to-treat exposed population) at Week 48. The study was not powered to compare arms. Results: For DTG (n = 69), the baseline HIV-1 RNA was >100 000 copies/mL in 64% of participants, with a median CD4+ count of 208 cells/mm3; for EFV (n = 44), 55% of participants had HIV-1 RNA >100 000 copies/mL, with a median CD4+ count of 202 cells/mm3. The Week 48 response rates were 75% (52/69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 65-86%) for DTG and 82% (36/44, 95% CI 70-93%) for EFV. The DTG nonresponses were driven by non-treatment related discontinuations (n = 10 lost to follow-up). There were no deaths or study drug switches. There were 2 discontinuations for toxicity (EFV). There were 3 protocol-defined virological failures (2 DTG, no acquired resistance; 1 EFV, emergent resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors). The tuberculosis treatment success rate was high. Tuberculosis-associated IRIS was uncommon (4/arm), with no discontinuations for IRIS. Conclusions: Among adults with HIV receiving rifampicin-based tuberculosis treatment, twice-daily DTG was effective and well tolerated.

If left untreated, chronic infection can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. The advent of new direct-acting antivirals (DAA) has revolutionized patients’ chances of treatment and viral elimination. Currently, several DAA options are available on the market. Areas covered: This review focuses on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, tolerability and safety profile of DCV-TRIO, a twice-daily fixed-dose combination of daclatasvir, asunaprevir and beclabuvir approved in Japan for the treatment of genotype 1 HCV infection. Expert opinion: The DCV-TRIO combination achieved good response rates in genotype 1 patients (SVR12  95% in naïve subtype 1b), independently from IL28B genotype, cirrhotic status and prior interferon exposure. On the other hand, unsatisfying response rates were reported in DAA-experienced patients and the risk of RAS selection should not be underestimated. Moreover, DCV-TRIO lacks differentiation from its earlier-launched DAA rivals, presents an inconvenient twice-daily dosing schedule and is not recommended in patients with advanced liver and kidney disease. All these drawbacks considerably limit its effective commercial potential. However, it can be a therapeutic option against HCV in tailored approaches according to the needs of different markets across the world.

Niacin showed a potential atheroprotective effects suggesting possible co-administration with fenofibrate with a potential for development of fixed dose combination. The chemical structure of both drugs highlights the opportunity for interaction upon co-processing due to the existence of complementary hydrogen bonding sites. Accordingly, fenofibrate and niacin were co-processed by wet co-grinding and the resulting product was assessed using scanning electron microscopy, FTIR, thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction in addition to dissolution studies. The instrumental analysis indicated the development of submicron fenofibrate crystals stabilized over the surface of niacin crystals. The developed submicron crystals showed fast dissolution of fenofibrate depending on the relative proportions of fenofibrate to niacin. Co-processing of both drugs at dose ratio which contained higher proportion of niacin resulted in further enhancement in the dissolution rate. This further enhancement was attributed to the hydrotropic effect of niacin which was proved by solubility study in addition to size reduction. This supposition was confirmed from the inferior dissolution of fenofibrate from the physical mixture. The study introduces fenofibrate/niacin as potential fixed dose combination for augmented dissolution rate and pharmacological effects.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10837450.2019.1682609;3.3;3.5;3.7;;31642728;;;;

Methods: Mean intraocular pressure (IOP) change from baseline was measured at study visits following a switch to PF tafluprost/timolol FC. Primary endpoint was absolute mean IOP change at month 6. Change from baseline concerning ocular signs and symptoms was also explored. Results: Analyses included 577 patients (59.6% female). Mean age (SD) was 67.8 (11.67) years. Mean (SD) IOP reduction from baseline was significant at all study visits; 5.4 (3.76) mmHg (23.7%) at week 4, 5.9 (3.90) mmHg (25.6%) at week 12, and 5.7 (4.11) mmHg (24.9%) at month 6 (p < 0.0001 for all visits). At month 6, 69.2%, 53.6%, 40.0%, and 25.8% were responders based on  20%,  25%,  30%, and  35% cutoff values for mean IOP, respectively. Significant reductions were observed concerning corneal fluorescein staining (p < 0.0001), dry eye symptoms, irritation, itching, and foreign body sensation (p < 0.001 for each parameter). Conjunctival hyperemia was significantly reduced at all study visits (p < 0.0001 at each visit). Overall, 69 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were reported, one of which was serious (status asthmaticus). Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity, and the majority had resolved or were resolving at the end of the study period. Conclusion: In clinical practice, PF tafluprost/timolol FC provided statistically and clinically significant IOP reductions in patients with OAG and OHT insufficiently controlled on or intolerant to PGA or beta-receptor blocker monotherapy. The full IOP reduction appeared at week 4 and was maintained over the 6-month study period. Key symptoms of ocular surface health improved.

We aimed to establish whether an inexpensive point mutation assay can improve virological suppression by identifying PDR to guide drug selection for ART in a lower-middle income country. Methods: Investigators did an open-label, randomised controlled trial at three HIV treatment sites in Kenya: two in Nairobi and one in rural Maseno. Individuals (aged 2 years) were eligible to participate if they were confirmed HIV-seropositive, qualified for first-line ART, planned to reside in the area for more than 1 year, and provided informed consent. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to either PDR testing by oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA) to guide selection of ART or to standard of care, which did not include OLA testing. The OLA-guided therapy group had pre-ART peripheral blood mononuclear cells evaluated for drug resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) at codons Lys103Asn, Tyr181Cys, Gly190Ala, and to lamivudine at Met184Val, and when at least one drug-resistant codon was detected in a participant's pre-ART specimen, clinicians were directed to prescribe protease inhibitor-based second-line ART. Those without detected resistance and those who were randomised to standard of care received NNRTI-based first-line ART. The primary outcome was plasma HIV-1 RNA of at least 400 copies per mL at 4, 8, or 12 months after ART initiation, which defined virological failure, assessed in all participants who received treatment (data were censored for those lost-to-follow-up or who died). The study has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01898754. Findings: We screened 1198 participants between May 28, 2013, and Nov 4, 2014, of whom 991 (83%) were enrolled (492 received OLA and 495 received standard of care; four did not begin treatment). 93 participants (prevalence 9·4%) had PDR (95% CI 7·7–11·4). 34 (8·5%) of 400 participants in the OLA group had virological failure at month 12 of ART (95% CI 6·0–11·7) compared with 39 (9·7%) of 402 (7·0–13·0) in the standard-of-care group (log-rank p=0·26). Among participants with PDR, virological failure was lower in the OLA-guided therapy group than in the standard-of-care group: five (14%) of 35 compared with 13 (50%) of 26; p=0·0020). Among those prescribed NNRTI-based ART, participants given efavirenz were less likely to have virological failure than were those receiving nevirapine (odds ratio 0·37, 95% CI 0·22–0·62; p<0·0001). The OLA-guided therapy group had 39 serious non-lethal adverse events and 34 deaths. The standard-of-care group had 34 severe adverse events and 43 deaths, differences that were not significant. Adverse events judged to potentially be due to ART were few and similar between groups, with 17 (16%) in the OLA-guided therapy group and 16 (16%) in the standard-of-care group (p=0·90). Interpretation: Our finding that OLA testing for PDR reduced virological failure in only those with specific PDR mutations suggests that PDR poses less of a risk for virological failure than that predicted by past prevalence estimates, and that the value of PDR testing to reduce virological failure should be assessed for antiretroviral treatment regimens.

Methods: A wet granulation continuous tableting line was used to make the FDC drug product batches. Comparative data was generated for ten batches using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for core tablets, and gravimetric in-process control measurements (IPCs) applied to the ratio control of intra- and extra-granular blend (IG and EG). HPLC reference data were collected to further demonstrate uniformity at each stage of the production process, including IG, final blend, and core tablets. All possible sources of variation not directly detectable by the gravimetric measurements were considered and quantified. Results: The two IPC measurement techniques showed excellent agreement where both were within 2% of the target drug concentrations and within 2% of each other for the ten comparative batches. The NIR was more sensitive to material and process variations than the gravimetric IPCs; thus, it was more variable within and across batches. Gravimetric IPCs were demonstrated as an effective replacement for spectroscopic measurements for continuous tableting operations, capable of ensuring on target manufacturing and detection of non-conforming material. Conclusions: As pharmaceutical companies continue to push toward operational simplicity and sustainable manufacturing processes, soft-sensor and gravimetric controls as alternatives to their spectroscopic counterparts will be applied more broadly for process monitoring and control.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12247-020-09498-2;3.7;3.4;2.5;;;;;;

Factors associated with overweight/obesity among antiretroviral therapy (ART) recipients have not been sufficiently studied in Botswana. Objectives. To: (i) estimate the prevalence and trends in overweight/obesity by duration of exposure to ART among recipients, (ii) assess changes in BMI categories among ART recipients between their first clinic visit (BMI-1) and their last clinic visit (BMI-2), (iii) identify ART regimen that predicts overweight/obesity better than the others and factors associated with BMI changes among ART recipients. Methods. A 12-year retrospective record-based review was conducted. Potential predictors of BMI change among patients after at least three years of ART exposure were examined using a multiple logistic regression model. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. ART regimens, duration of exposure to ART, and recipients' demographic and biomedical characteristics including the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus-related comorbidities (DRC), defined as any morbidity associated with type 2 diabetes as described in the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems (ICD-10-CM) codebook index, were investigated as potential predictors of overweight/obesity. Results. Twenty-nine percent of recipients were overweight, 16.6% had obesity of whom 2.4% were morbidly-obese at the last clinic visit. Overweight/obese recipients were more likely to be female, to have DRC and less likely to have CD4 count between 201 and 249 cells/mm3. Neither the first-line nor the second-, third-line ART regimens predicted overweight/obesity better than the other and neither did the duration of exposure to ART. No significant linear trends were observed in the prevalence of overweight/obesity by the duration of exposure to ART. Conclusion. These results suggest that the ART regimens studied have a comparable effect on overweight/obesity and that the duration of exposure does not affect the outcome. This study calls for further research to elucidate the relative contribution of various factors to BMI change among recipients, including ART regimens.;https://www.hindawi.com/journals/art/2020/8016791/;2.5;2.2;3.2;;;8016791;;;

Recently, the Atlantis study reports small airways involvement in 91% of the asthma population. Therefore in the era of phenotype driven therapy, the aim of this study was to verify if high-strength extrafine ICS/LABA in fixed dose increases clinical efficacy in moderate asthmatic patients with small airways dysfunction and it could be proposed as phenotype driven therapy. Methods: In this prospective, non-interventional, real-life pilot study we enrolled 37 consecutive patients with moderate asthma who were uncontrolled despite GINA step 3 treatment. All subjects at enrollment were divided in two groups according to the presence of small airways dysfunction:1) small airways phenotype (SAP) group: smokers (10 packs/die), ex-smokers (>20 packs/year) with air trapping (FVC <80% - VR >100% - FEF 25–75%<60%); 2) non-small airways phenotype (NSAP) group: non-smokers, without air trapping (FVC 80% - VR  100% - FEF 25–75%60%). We later proceeded in both groups with a step up in therapy with high-strength extrafine pMDI beclomethasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate (BDP/FF) (200/6 g) in fixed dose to achieve a better control and followed patients for 6 months. Results: Treatment with extrafine BDP/FF(200/6 g) in SAP group showed a more significant improvement of FEF25-75%, FVC, RV, and a reduction of alveolar inflammatory markers such as FENO350 and alveolar exhaled pH compared with NSAP patients. Conclusions: Our preliminary results support the use of high-strength extrafine pMDI BDP/FF (200/6 g) as phenotype driven treatment directed to small airways dysfunction demonstrating an increase of clinical efficacy in moderate asthmatics with SAP.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1094553919302561;4.9;4.9;4.3;S1094553919302561;31866498;101879;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1094553919302561;;

Most cART-treated patients aging with controlled HIV replication are currently admitted to the ICU for non-AIDS-related events, mostly bacterial pneumonia and exacerbation of comorbidities, variably affected by chronic HIV infection (COPD, cardiovascular diseases, or solid neoplasms). Today, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, cerebral toxoplasmosis, TB, and other severe opportunistic infections only occur in patients with unknown viral status, limited access to cART, viral resistance, or compliance issues. Acute respiratory failure, neurological disorders, and sepsis remain the main conditions that lead HIV-infected patients to the ICU, although admissions for liver diseases or acute kidney injury are increasing. Case fatality dropped substantially over the past decades, reaching figures of HIV-uninfected critically ill patients with similar demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and level of organ dysfunctions. Several other facets of critical care management have evolved in this population, including diagnostic procedures, cART management at the acute phase of critical illness, and ethical considerations. The goal of this narrative review was to depict the current evidence and emerging challenges for the management of critically ill, HIV-infected patients, almost 40 years following the onset of the AIDS epidemic.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0012369219314539;10.0;11.1;12.1;S0012369219314539;31421114;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0012369219314539;;

We implemented an Active Case Management Network to promote early ART initiation Aiming for Cure (ACC) in August 2014. We describe ACC implementation, early infant diagnosis (EID) coverage and ART initiation during August 2014 to July 2018 compared with a national EID survey during October 2007 to September 2011 (pre-ACC). Methods: Thailand's 2014 HIV Treatment Guidelines recommend that HIV-exposed infants have HIV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at birth, one month and at two to four months. Testing is done at 14 national HIV PCR laboratories. When an HIV-positive infant (HIV PCR+) is identified, PCR laboratory staff send the result to the hospital staff responsible for the infant's care and to the national laboratory case manager (CM). As part of ACC, the national laboratory CM alerts a regional CM who contacts the hospital staff caring for the infant to offer technical support with ART initiation and ART adherence. CMs enter clinical, demographic and laboratory data into the national ACC database. We analysed the ACC data from August 2014 to July 2018 to assess the ACC's impact on EID coverage, ART initiation and time-to-ART initiation. Results: The uptake of EID increased from 64% (pre-ACC) to >95% in 2018 (ACC). The number of HIV-positive infants born declined from 429 cases (pre-ACC) to 267 cases (ACC). Median age at the first-positive PCR declined from 75 days (pre-ACC) to 60 days (ACC); P < 0.001. Among 429 infants diagnosed before ACC was started, 241 (56%) received ART; during ACC, 235 (88%) of 267 HIV-positive infants received ART. The median age at ART initiation declined from 282 days before ACC to 83 days during ACC (P < 0.001) and the median time from blood collection to ART initiation declined from 168 days before ACC to 23 days during ACC (P < 0.001). Conclusions: An innovative case management network (ACC) has been established in Thailand and results suggest that the network is promoting EID and early ART initiation. The ACC model, using case-managed PCR notification and follow-up, may speed ART initiation in other settings.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jia2.25450;5.5;6.7;7.1;;32107884;e25450;;;

We sought here to better understand the complex link between clinical and treatment features and HIV persistence despite therapy. A total of 11,045 samples from 1,160 individuals under combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with an unquantifiable viral load (VL; limit of quantification, 20 copies/ml) were categorized as detectable or undetectable depending on the detection of a PCR signal using a commercially available assay. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression was used to model viral load detectability and to assess the determinants of residual viremia (RV; VL detected below 20 copies/ml) despite therapy. A high VL zenith was associated with a higher probability to have a detectable viremia under cART. Conversely, the probability to have a detectable viral load below 20 copies/ml decreased with time under therapy. Of therapy regimens, protease inhibitor (PI)-based cART was associated with a significantly higher probability of detectable RV compared to nonnucleoside transcriptase inhibitor-or integrase inhibitor-based cART. We found that a PI-based treatment regimen is highly associated with an increased frequency of RV, supporting previous evidence suggesting that PI-based cART regimens could favor ongoing viral replication in some individuals.";https://aac.asm.org/content/64/3/e01902-19;7.8;7.9;8.3;;31818822;e01902;;;

The occurrence of IgAN is associated with affected tonsils which enhances the IgA production via IgA class switching and immuno-activation. Follicular dendritic cell-secreted protein (FDC-SP) was found to be a negative effect for IgA production in tonsil. The previous studies suggested that Triptolide might reduce IgA production by its immunosuppression role. Given this background, this study investigated the mechanisms underlying the role of Triptolide and FDC-SP in the generation of IgA and IgA class switching in tonsil of IgAN patients. Immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the expression of FDC-SP was increased in the tonsils of IgAN patients with Triptolide treatment compared with those without treatment. Meanwhile, the expression of FDC-SP was negatively correlated with IgA inducing cytokines in the tonsils of IgAN patients treated with Triptolide, due to the significant decreased IgA-bearing cells. The expression of FDC-SP in tonsillar tissue was confirmed by double immunofluorescence. Importantly, Triptolide promoted FDC-SP secretion, and correlated negatively with decreased IgA production in isolated FDC-associated clusters, which had been isolated from patients without TW treatment previously. Our study demonstrated that Triptolide might have an impact on FDC-SP production and downregulation of IgA synthesis in the tonsils of IgAN patients, which could be a promising strategy for therapeutic intervention in IgAN patients.;https://www.hh.um.es/Abstracts/Vol_35/35_6/35_6_599.htm;3.9;3.7;3.6;;;;;;

As a result, the life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH) has increased significantly. PLWH do, however, continue to experience a significantly higher risk of noninfectious comorbidities and chronic age-related complications, including cardiovascular disease and malignancies, which are now the biggest drivers of this excess morbidity and mortality. Therefore, in addition to virologic failure, the management of the treatment-experienced patient increasingly requires optimization of ART to enhance tolerability, avoid drug–drug interactions, and mitigate non-AIDS complications and comorbid conditions. This article will present principles of the management of virologic failure, poor immunologic recovery, and strategies for optimizing ART in the setting of virologic suppression.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2049936120901395;0;0;0;;;;;;

HIV Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British HIV AssociationObjectives: Widespread access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has substantially increased life expectancy in sub-Saharan African countries. As a result, the rates of comorbidities and use of co-medications among people living with HIV are increasing, necessitating a sound understanding of drug–drug interactions (DDIs). We aimed to assess the prevalence and management of DDIs with ART in a rural Tanzanian setting. Methods: We included consenting HIV-positive adults initiating ART in the Kilombero and Ulanga Antiretroviral Cohort (KIULARCO) between January 2013 and December 2016. DDIs were classified using www.hiv-druginteractions.org as red (contra-indicated), amber (potential clinical relevance requiring dosage adjustment/monitoring), yellow (weak clinical significance unlikely to require further management) or green (no interaction). We assessed management of amber DDIs by evaluating monitoring of laboratory or clinical parameters, or changes in drug dosages. Results: Of 2069 participants, 1945 (94%) were prescribed at least one co-medication during a median follow-up of 1.8 years. Of these, 645 (33%) had at least one potentially clinically relevant DDI, with the highest grade being red in nine (< 1%) and amber in 636 (33%) participants. Of the 23 283 prescriptions, 19 (< 1%) and 1745 (7%) were classified as red and amber DDIs, respectively. Overall, 351 (2%) prescriptions were red DDIs or not appropriately managed amber DDIs. Conclusions: Co-medication use was common in this rural sub-Saharan cohort. A third of participants had DDIs requiring further management. Of the 9% of participants with not appropriately managed DDIs, most were with cardiovascular and analgesic drugs. This highlights the importance of physicians’ awareness of DDIs for their recognition and management.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hiv.12801;5.6;5.3;5.8;;31532898;;;;

To better understand the mechanism for preterm birth among HIV-infected women, we evaluated whether mid-trimester cervical length differed by HIV status as cervical shortening is associated with an increased risk for preterm birth. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study among pregnant women receiving care at the Scottish Livingstone Hospital in Molepolole, Botswana. Consecutive women referred for routine obstetrical ultrasound were consented and enrolled if between 22w0d and 24w6d by ultrasound biometry. Blinded to maternal HIV status, an obstetrician measured transvaginal cervical length using standardized criteria. Cervical length, as well as the proportion of women with a short cervix (<25mm), were compared among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women. The acceptability of transvaginal ultrasound was also evaluated. Results Between April 2016 and April 2017, 853 women presenting for obstetric ultrasound were screened, 187 (22%) met eligibility criteria, and 179 (96%) were enrolled. Of those enrolled, 50 (28%) were HIV-infected (86% on antiretroviral therapy), 127 (71%) were HIV-uninfected, and 2 (1%) had unknown HIV status. There was no significant difference in mean cervical length between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women (32mm vs 31mm, p = 0.21), or in the proportion with a short cervix (10% vs 14%, p = 0.44). Acceptability data was available for 115 women who underwent a transvaginal ultrasound exam. Of these, 112 of 115 (97%) women deemed the transvaginal scan acceptable. Conclusions The increased risk of preterm birth observed among HIV-infected women receiving antiretroviral therapy in Botswana is unlikely associated with mid-trimester cervical shortening. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanism for preterm birth among HIV-infected women.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229500;5.7;5.4;5.2;;32160214;e0229500;;;

Simplifying ART improves patient adherence and quality of life, but changes in drug interactions (DIs) are uncertain. Objective: This study assessed changes in DIs following ART simplification in patients with HIV. Methods: This was an observational, retrospective cohort study of patients attending an urban HIV clinic. Patients were included if they had ART simplification (a decreased number of daily tablets) and 1 concomitant medication (CM). Total DI scores were generated for each patient pre–ART simplification and post–ART simplification using an online DI database. Each ART-CM pair labeled as “do not co-administer” was given a score of 2, “potential interaction” a score of 1, or “no interaction” a score of 0. Differences in total DI scores following simplification were analyzed with a Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. Predictors of DI score reductions were examined with linear regression. Results: A total of 99 patients were included. Their median age was 54 years, and 79% were male. The median durations of HIV infection and ART were 16 and 10 years, respectively. Patients were receiving an average of 4.5 CMs. Median interaction scores presimplification and postsimplification were 3 (interquartile range [IQR], 1-6) and 1 (IQR, 0-2) respectively (P < 0.001).

All rights reserved.Importance: Fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapies are being increasingly recommended for initial or early management of patients with hypertension, as they reduce treatment complexity and potentially reduce therapeutic inertia. Objective: To investigate the association of antihypertensive triple drug FDC therapy with therapeutic inertia and prescribing patterns compared with usual care. Design, Setting, and Participants: A post hoc analysis of the Triple Pill vs Usual Care Management for Patients With Mild-to-Moderate Hypertension (TRIUMPH) study, a randomized clinical trial of 700 patients with hypertension, was conducted. Patients were enrolled from 11 urban hospital clinics in Sri Lanka from February 2016 to May 2017; follow-up ended in October 2017. Data were analyzed from September to November 2019. Interventions: Once-daily FDC antihypertensive pill (telmisartan, 20 mg; amlodipine, 2.5 mg; and chlorthalidone, 12.5 mg) or usual care. Main Outcomes and Measures: Therapeutic inertia, defined as not intensifying therapy in those with blood pressure (BP) above target, was assessed at baseline and during follow-up visits. Prescribing patterns were characterized by BP-lowering drug class and treatment regimen potency. Predictors of therapeutic inertia were assessed with binomial logistic regression. Results: Of the 700 included patients, 403 (57.6%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 56 (11) years. Among patients who did not reach the BP target, therapeutic inertia was more common in the triple pill group compared with the usual care group at the week 6 visit (92 of 106 [86.8%] vs 124 of 194 [63.9%]; P <.001) and week 12 visit (81 of 90 [90%] vs 116 of 179 [64.8%]; P <.001). At the end of the study, 221 of 318 patients in the triple pill group (69.5%) and 182 of 329 patients in the usual care group (55.3%) reached BP targets. Among those who received treatment intensification, the increase in estimated regimen potency was greater in the triple pill group compared with the usual care group at baseline (predicted mean [SD] increase in regimen potency: triple pill, 15 [6] mm Hg; usual care, 10 [5] mm Hg; P <.001), whereas there were no significant differences at the week 6 or at week 12 visit. Clinic systolic BP level was the only consistent predictor of treatment intensification during follow-up. During follow-up, there were 23 vs 54 unique treatment regimens per 100 treated patients in the triple pill vs usual care groups, respectively (P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Triple pill FDC therapy was associated with greater rates of therapeutic inertia compared with usual care. Despite this, triple pill FDC therapy substantially simplified prescribing patterns and improved 6-month BP control rates compared with usual care. Further improvements in hypertension control could be achieved by addressing therapeutic inertia among the minority of patients who do not achieve BP control after initial FDC therapy.

In view of the fast viremia decline obtained with integrase inhibitors, we studied the respective effects of initiating efavirenz (EFV) or raltegravir (RAL)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels and inflammation biomarkers in the highly inflammatory setting of advanced HIV-1 disease with tuberculosis (TB) coinfection. Methods. We followed cell-associated HIV-1 DNA, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), soluble CD14 and D-Dimer levels for 48 weeks after ART initiation in the participants to the ANRS12-180 REFLATE-TB study. This phase II open-label randomized study included ART-naive people with HIV and TB treated with rifampicin to receive RAL 400 mg twice daily (RAL400), RAL 800 mg twice daily (RAL800) or EFV 600 mg QD with tenofovir and lamivudine. Results. In 146 participants, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) week (W)0 HIV-1 DNA level was 4.7 (IQR, 4.3–5.1) log10 copies/106 CD4+, and the reduction by W48 was 0.8 log10 copies/106 CD4+ on EFV, 0.9 on RAL400, and 1.0 on RAL800 (P = .74). Baseline median (IQR) hsCRP, IL-6, sCD14, and D-Dimer levels were 6.9 (IQR, 3.3–15.6) mg/L, 7.3 (IQR, 3.5–12.3) pg/mL, 3221 (IQR, 2383–4130) ng/mL, and 975 (IQR, 535–1970) ng/mL. All biomarker levels decreased over the study: the overall W0–W48 mean (95% confidence interval) fold-change on ART was 0.37 (IQR, 0.28–0.48) for hsCRP, 0.42 (IQR, 0.35–0.51) for IL-6, 0.51 (IQR, 0.47–0.56) for sCD14, and 0.39 (IQR, 0.32–0.47) for D-Dimers. There were no differences in biomarker reduction across treatment arms. Conclusions. In participants with HIV and TB, EFV, RAL400, or RAL800 effectively and equally reduced inflammation and HIV-1 DNA levels.;https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofz549/5700746;3.5;4.6;3.8;;;ofz549;;;

Additionally, a multi-step batch-based manufacturing process is usually required for production of solid dosage forms. This study presents the development and production, by twin-screw melt granulation technology, of a high-dose immediate-release fixed-dose combination (FDC) product of metformin hydrochloride (MET) and sitagliptin phosphate (SIT), with drug loads of 80% w/w and 6% w/w, respectively. For an 850/63 mg dose of MET/SIT, the final weight of the caplets was approximately 1063 mg compared with 1143 mg for the equivalent dose in Janumet®, the marketed product. Mixtures of the two drugs and polymers were melt-granulated at temperatures below the individual melting temperatures of MET and SIT (231.65 and 213.89°C, respectively) but above the glass transition temperature or melting temperature of the binder(s) used. By careful selection of binders, and processing conditions, direct compressed immediate-release caplets with desired product profiles were successfully produced. The melt granule formulations before compression showed good flow properties, were larger in particle size than individual starting API materials and were easily compressible. Melt granulation is a suitable platform for developing direct compressible high-dose immediate-release solid dosage forms of FDC products.;http://link.springer.com/10.1208/s12249-019-1553-2;3.5;3.1;4.0;;31832799;23;;;

HIV genotyping was performed using samples collected at study screening or enrollment. HIV drug resistance was evaluated using the Stanford v8.7 algorithm. A multiassay algorithm was used to identify individuals with recent HIV infection. Clustering of HIV sequences was evaluated using phylogenetic methods.Results:High-level HIV drug resistance was detected in 44 (31%) of 142 individuals (Atlanta: 21%, Baltimore: 29%, Birmingham: 53%, Boston: 26%); 12% had multiclass resistance, 16% had resistance to tenofovir or emtricitabine, and 8% had resistance to integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs); 3% had intermediate-level resistance to second-generation INSTIs. In a multivariate model, self-report of ever having been on antiretroviral therapy (ART) was associated with resistance (P=0.005). One of six recently infected individuals had drug resistance. Phylogenetic analysis identified five clusters of study sequences; two clusters had shared resistance mutations.Conclusion:High prevalence of drug resistance was observed among MSM. Some had multiclass resistance, resistance to drugs used for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and INSTI resistance.

The reported retention at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months were 90.7%, 78.1%, 68.8% and 64.4%, respectively. We report findings of a follow-up evaluation for the 2012-2015 cohorts to assess the implementation and impact of recommendations from this prior evaluation. Methods: A nationwide retrospective study was conducted in 2016. Multi-stage proportional sampling was used to select health facilities and study participants records. The data extracted from patient manual records included demographic, baseline clinical characteristics and patient outcomes (active on treatment, died, transferred out, stopped ART and lost to follow-up (LTFU)) at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. The data were analysed using Stata/IC 14.2. Retention was estimated using survival analysis. The predictors associated with attrition were determined using a multivariate Cox regression model. Results: A total of 3,810 participants were recruited in the study. The median age in years was 35 (IQR: 28-42). Overall, retention increased to 92.4% (p-value = 0.060), 86.5% (p-value<0.001), 79.2% (p-value<0.001) and 74.4% (p-value<0.001) at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months respectively. LTFU accounted for 98% of attrition. Being an adolescent or a young adult (15-24 years) (vs adult;1.41; 95% CI:1.14-1.74), children (<15years) (vs adults; aHR 0.64; 95% CI:0.46-0.91), receiving care at primary health care facility (vs central and provincial facility; aHR 1.23; 95% CI:1.01-1.49), having initiated ART between 2014-2015 (vs 2012-2013; aHR1.45; 95%CI:1.24-1.69), having WHO Stage IV (vs Stage I-III; aHR2.06; 95%CI:1.51-2.81) and impaired functional status (vs normal status; aHR1.25; 95%CI:1.04- 1.49) predicted attrition. Conclusion: The overall retention was higher in comparison to the previous 2007-2010 evaluation. Further studies to understand why attrition was found to be higher at primary health care facilities are warranted. Implementation of strategies for managing patients with advanced HIV disease, differentiated care for adolescents and young adults and tracking of LTFU clients should be prioritised to further improve retention.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222309;5.7;5.4;5.2;;31910445;e0222309;;;

Objective: We prospectively evaluated the effects of HAART on albumin-to-creatinine ratios (ACRs) in antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected individuals. Methods: One hundred and two (102) newly diagnosed, antiretroviral-naïve, human immunodefi-ciency virus (HIV)-infected persons were treated with Tenofovir disoproxil fu-marate/Emtricitabine/Efavirenz (TDF/FTC/EFV), n=33; Zidovudine/Lamivudine/Nevirapine (ZDV/3TC/NVP), n=53; and Zidovudine/Lamivudine/Efavirenz (ZDV/3TC/EFV), n=16. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were excluded. ACRs and glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) were estimated at baseline, and at 1, 3, 6 and 9 months post-therapy; the prevalence of albuminuria (ACR  300mg/g), and microalbuminuria (ACR 30-300mg/g) were similarly estimated. HAART effects on normal ACR (0-30mg/g) were also monitored. Results: At baseline, one patient (0.9%) had nephrotic-range albuminuria with ACR of 2450mg/g. Overall, 8 (7.8%) patients had albuminuria; 53 (51.9%) had microalbuminuria; while 41 (40.2%) had normal ACRs, 28 (27.5% of 102) of which had nonalbuminuric renal insufficiency. eGFR and ACRs improved concurrently on HAART (ACR, Wilks’ lambda 0.439, power 0.763, p=0.032); albuminuria improved significantly on all the 3 regimens at 9 months (p=0.006, 0.012 and <0.001 respectively). Microalbuminuria resolved earlier (1 month) with ZDV/3TC/NVP than with TDF/FTC/EFV and ZDV/3TC/EFV (24.31mg/g versus 76.51mg/g and 63.59mg/g; p=0.028, 0.016 respectively). Microalbuminuria relapsed on TDF/FTC/EFV and ZDV/3TC/EFV at 6 months but resolved again at 9 months (66.7 versus 29 mg/g, p=0.006; and 51.2 versus 9.5mg/g, p=0.001 re-spectively); no relapse on ZDV/3TC/NVP. At 9 months, ZDV/3TC/EFV caused the greatest reso-lution of microalbuminuria (85.7% decline in ACR from baseline) compared with ZDV/3TC/NVP (72.5% decline) and TDF/FTC/EFV (63.9% decline). In multivariate analyses, predictors of ACR include older age (Odds ratio OR 2.8, p= 0.025); female gender (OR, 3.4, p =0.014); CD4+ (OR 0.99, p=0.002). Conclusion: HIV induces renal impairment. Thus, albuminuria, microalbuminuria and nonalbu-minuric renal insufficiency are highly prevalent in antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected persons but nephrotic-range albuminuria is uncommon. Albuminuria and/microalbuminuria and eGFR im-prove concurrently on HAART (with/without tenofovir DF). Zidovudine-based HAART (ZDV/3TC/NVP) resolves microalbuminuria earlier, and without relapse, unlike Tenovofir-based regimen and zidovudine with efavirenz (ZDV/3TC/EFV).";https://www.eurekaselect.com/174164/article;2.1;1.9;1.4;;31389318;;;;

This post-authorisation safety study examined adverse outcomes and prescribing practices for FP/FORM and other FDC ICS/LABA therapies in a real-life clinical setting over 36 months. Methods: Historical, longitudinal cohort database study using UK primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) database, for patients initiated on or switched to an FDC ICS/LABA (ENCePP study number: EUPAS12330). The main cohort was adults aged  18 years with asthma. The primary outcome was incidence of new adverse outcomes after initiation of ICS/LABA; hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated for FP/FORM versus other FDC ICS/LABAs using Cox regression models. Results: A total of 241,007 patients with an FDC ICS/LABA prescription were identified. In the adult asthma cohort (N = 41,609), the incidence rate of new adverse outcomes [in 100 patient-years (py)] was significantly lower for FP/FORM (24.75) versus fluticasone/salmeterol metered-dose inhaler [8.86; HR 1.14 (1.04, 1.25)], fluticasone/salmeterol dry powder inhaler [31.19; HR 1.18 (1.08, 1.29)], budesonide/formoterol [25.16; HR: 1.13 (1.03, 1.25)] and beclometasone/formoterol [25.47; HR 1.14 (1.04, 1.25)]. The overall prescribing rate was lower for FP/FORM (13.85 per 1000/py) than licensed FDC ICS/LABA comparators (20.30–28.13 per 1000/py). Of those prescribed FP/FORM, 80.8% were adults with asthma and < 7% were prescribed FP/FORM “off-label”. Conclusions: The results suggest that FP/FORM was associated with an overall lower adverse outcome rate than the licensed comparators.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40265-019-01224-8;9.4;9.2;9.6;;31749061;;;;

In line with UNAIDS recommendations extending ART to all HIV-infected individuals, we conducted this demonstration project on immediate treatment as prevention (TasP) among FSWs in Cotonou, Benin. We report data on treatment response and its relation to adherence, as well as on ART-resistant genotypes. Methods Complete follow-up varied between 12 and 24 months. At each three-monthly visit, a questionnaire was administered, clinical examinations were carried out and blood samples collected. Adherence to treatment was estimated by self-report. Viral RNA was genotyped at baseline and final visits for drug resistance. Generalized estimating equations for repeated measures with a log-binomial link were used to analyze time trends and the association between adherence and virological response to treatment. Results One-hundred-seven HIV-positive and ART-naive FSWs were enrolled; 59.8% remained in the cohort till study completion and 62.6% had a final visit. Viral load<1000 (below quantification limit [<50]) was attained in 73.1% (64.6%) of participants at month-6, 84.8% (71.2%) at month-12, and 80.9% (65.1%) at the final visit. The proportion of women with suppressed (below quantification limit) viral load increased with increasing self-reported adherence (p = 0.06 (0.003), tests for trend). The proportion of participants with CD4500 also decreased drastically throughout follow-up (p < .0001). Twelve participants exhibited ART-resistant genotypes at baseline, but only two at their final visit.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0227184;5.7;5.4;5.2;;31971957;e0227184;;;

Here, we described a case of transmitted as well as acquired HIV drug resistance among a father, mother and infant. Epidemiological data were obtained retrospectively. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) of three patients were tested using a validated In-house Sanger-based sequencing (SBS) method and the Vela next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform. Gene evolution analysis was also performed. According to the epidemiological history and phylogenetic data, in late preg-nancy of the mother, the infant’s father transmitted HIV-1 to her, and then the mother to the baby, leading to the transmission of V106I as a common mutation of three persons. The mutant frequency was 99.57% (father), 95.38% (mother) and 99.73% (infant), respectively. Mother also acquired K101E (41.03%), K103N (27.56%) and minor mutation of V106M (4.30%) after improperly discontinuing antiretroviral regimen of lamivudine (3TC), tenofovir (TDF) and efavirenz (EFV). Such acquired mutations increased the drug resistance scores on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) doravirine, EFV, etravirine, nevir-apine and rilpivirine from 10, 0, 10, 10 and 10 to 65, 135, 25, 150 and 55, respectively. Therefore, sexually transmitted diseases, especially DRMs of HIV-1 in families, are of concern and draw attention to the need for enhanced drug-resistance prevention efforts, and accurate surveillance by more sensitive methods in complicated cases.;None;6.6;2.8;2.4;;;;;;

We aimed to evaluate whether individual in utero antiretroviral exposures were associated with increased risk of microcephaly based on long-term follow-up of infants and children who are HIV-exposed but uninfected. Methods: We evaluated children aged younger than 18 years who were HIV-exposed but uninfected with at least one head circumference measurement while enrolled in the Surveillance Monitoring for ART Toxicities (SMARTT) study at 22 clinical sites in the USA, including Puerto Rico. This prospective cohort study was done by the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study network. Microcephaly was defined as having a head circumference Z score <–2 according to the 2000 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts for children 6–36 months old and according to Nellhaus standards (head circumference <2nd percentile) after 36 months (SMARTT criteria); an alternate definition for microcephaly was based on applying Nellhaus standards across all ages (Nellhaus criteria). Modified Poisson regression models were fit to obtain relative risks (RRs) for associations between in utero antiretroviral exposure and microcephaly status, adjusted for potential confounders. Neurodevelopmental functioning was compared in children who are HIV-exposed but uninfected with or without microcephaly. Findings: Between March 21, 2007, and Aug 1, 2017, 3055 participants enrolled in SMARTT had at least one head circumference measurement. The cumulative incidence of microcephaly over a median of 5·1 years of follow-up (IQR 3·0–7·2) was 159 (5·2%, 95% CI 4·4–6·1) by Nellhaus criteria and 70 (2·3%, 1·8–2·9) by SMARTT criteria. In adjusted models, in utero exposure to efavirenz (4·7% exposed) was associated with increased risk of microcephaly by both Nellhaus standards (adjusted RR 2·02, 95% CI 1·16–3·51) and SMARTT criteria (2·56, 1·22–5·37). These associations were more pronounced in children exposed to combination regimens of efavirenz that included zidovudine plus lamivudine than those including tenofovir plus emtricitabine. Protective associations were observed for darunavir exposure (adjusted RR 0·50, 95% CI 0·24–1·00). Children who are HIV-exposed but uninfected with microcephaly had lower mean scores on neurodevelopmental assessments at age 1 and 5 years and a higher prevalence of neurodevelopmental impairment than those without microcephaly. Interpretation: These findings support consideration of alternatives to efavirenz as part of first-line antiretroviral therapy for pregnant women.

American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.The flow duration curve (FDC) is effectively the cumulative distribution function of streamflow. For a long time, hydrologists have sought deeper understanding of the process controls on the shape of FDC, which has been a challenge due to contrasting processes controlling the fast flow and slow flow components of streamflow and their interactions. In this paper, we outline a new framework for exploring the process controls of the FDC, which involves studying fast and slow flow components of FDC separately and combining them statistically, explicitly accounting for their dependence. We illustrate the potential of the framework by constructing empirical fast flow duration (FFDC) and slow flow duration (SFDC) curves from the flow components obtained by traditional baseflow separation. Streamflow time series data from 245 MOPEX catchments across the continental United States are used. The dependence of FFDC and SFDC components is captured by the Gumbel copula, the strength of which varies regionally. In catchments where FFDC and SFDC are independent, FDC can be approximated by a simple convolution of FFDC and SFDC. The proposed conceptual framework opens the way for future modeling studies to explore process controls of fast and slow components of streamflow separately, their dependence, and their relative contributions to the shape of the FDC.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019WR026083;7.2;7.4;6.8;;;e2019WR026083;;;

Dolutegravir-based 2-drug regimens (DTG 2DRs) are now accepted as alternatives to 3-drug regimens for HIV antiretroviral treatment (ART); however, literature on physician drivers for prescribing DTG 2DR is sparse. This study evaluated treatment patterns of DTG 2DR components in clinical practice in the US. Methods. This was a retrospective chart review in adult patients in care in the US with HIV-1 who received DTG 2DR prior to July 31, 2017, with follow-up until January 30, 2018. Primary objectives of the study were to determine reasons for patients initiating DTG 2DR and to describe the demographics and clinical characteristics. All analyses were descriptive. Results. Overall, 278 patients received DTG 2DR (male: 70%; mean age: 56 years). Most patients were treatment experienced (98%), with a mean 13.5 years of prior ART. DTG was most commonly paired with darunavir (55%) or rilpivirine (27%). The most common physician-reported reasons for initiating DTG 2DR were treatment simplification/streamlining (30%) and avoidance of potential long-term toxicities (20%). Before starting DTG 2DR, 42% of patients were virologically suppressed; of those, 95% maintained suppression while on DTG 2DR. Of the 50% of patients with detectable viral load before DTG 2DR, 79% achieved and maintained virologic suppression on DTG 2DR during follow-up. There were no virologic data for 8% of patients prior to starting DTG 2DR. Only 15 patients discontinued DTG 2DR, of whom 4 (27%) discontinued due to virologic failure. Conclusions. Prior to commercial availability of the single-tablet 2DRs, DTG 2DR components were primarily used in treatment-experienced patients for treatment simplification and avoidance of long-term toxicities. Many of these patients achieved and maintained virologic suppression, with low discontinuation rates.";https://www.hindawi.com/journals/art/2020/5923256/;2.5;2.2;3.2;;;5923256;;;

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is considered to be closely associated with the pathogenesis of IPT-like variant of FDCS. Hepatic FDCS has an exceedingly low incidence of only 28 cases reported, with most of these tumors being classified as the IPT-like type. We report a case of an IPT-like variant of FDCS of the liver in a 61-year old man who presented with no marked symptoms. The patient underwent laparoscopic surgery for the mass and was well during a 13-month follow-up periods. The postoperative pathological examination found a proliferation of spindle cells and a diffuse infiltration of inflammatory cells within the tumor. Immunohistochemistry revealed that neoplastic cells were positive for CD23, clusterin, fascin, and PD-L1, and weakly positive for CD35, SMA, and D2-40. The infiltrating lymphocytes were strongly positive for PD1, and IgG4-positive plasma cells were less than 10 cells/high-power field. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER) was negative. To our knowledge, the present case is the second case of hepatic IPT-like variant of FDCS without EBV involvement, indicating that EBV infection is not an absolute prerequisite for a diagnosis of the IPT-like variant of FDCS.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2210740120301509;3.5;3.6;3.4;S2210740120301509;32540141;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2210740120301509;;

However, regimen change affects this treatment success. Yet, evidence on the incidence and predictors of regimen change is scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the incidence and predictors of initial antiretroviral therapy regimen change among HIV-infected adults receiving antiretroviral therapy. Methods: An institutional-based retrospective cohort study was conducted. Data were collected from patients’ charts selected by simple random sampling. Data entered into EpiData version 4.43 and analyzed by STATA version 13. The life table was used to estimate cumulative survival. Kaplan–Meir curve and Log-rank test were used to compare the survival experience of explanatory variables. Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify predictors. Results: Five hundred and eight patients were followed for 871.87 person-years of observation with the median follow-up period of 16.12 months. The incidence rate of initial ART regimen change was 11.36 (95% CI: 9.32–13.83) per 100 person-year and the median survival time is 54 months. Not disclosing HIV status (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 5.41, 95% CI = 2.38–12.27), comedication with ART (AHR = 4.64, 95% CI = 1.43–15.10), occurrence of side effect on initial regimen (AHR = 7.32, 95% CI = 4.43–12.10), baseline CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 (AHR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.37–3.47), ambulatory/bedridden baseline functional status (AHR = 3.55, 95% CI = 2.30–5.48) were significant predictors of initial regimen change. Conclusion: The incidence rate of initial ART regimen change was found to be low. HIV disclosure status, co-medication with ART, the occurrence of side effects on an initial regimen, low baseline CD4 count, ambulatory and bedridden baseline functional status were found to be predictors.;https://www.dovepress.com/incidence-and-predictors-of-initial-antiretroviral-therapy-regimen-cha-peer-reviewed-article-HIV;4.3;5.0;2.4;;;;;;

Although both display different mechanisms of activity, in combination they have a stronger broncho-dilating effect than monotherapy; hence, a combination of both LABA and LAMA is particularly recommended for patients whose symptoms cannot be sufficiently improved by a single active ingredient. To date, only few data have been collected regarding the therapeutic outcomes of approved LABA/ LAMA fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) under everyday (real-life) conditions in non-clinical trial settings. Objective and Methods: The main objective of the DETECT study was to investigate the impact of aclidinium/formoterol (AB/FF, b.i.d.), glycopyrronium/indacaterol (GLY/IND, q.d.) and umeclidinium/vilanterol (UME/VL, q.d.) in patients with COPD in daily clinical practice. Therefore, a prospective, non-randomized, 12-month, observational study was implemented to assess the effectiveness of these treatments in patients who had been switched to FDC within the last 3 months or for whom such a changeover was intended. Changes in lung function were analyzed by the forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) measures. Quality of life and well-being were evaluated by the COPD Assessment Test (CAT™). Furthermore, a number of exacerbations and early morning COPD symptoms were documented. Results: In total, 3653 patients were enrolled. FEV1 and FVC values significantly improved during the study with AB/FF (increase by 0.09 ± 0.40 L and 0.10 ± 0.57 L, respectively; p<0.0001), GLY/IND (0.06±0.38/0.05±0.51 L; p<0.0001 and p=0.0025) and UME/VL (0.12±0.39/0.10±0.52 L; p<0.0001). CAT scores decreased indicating improved COPD (AB/FF, 4.17±8.30; GLY/IND, 3.66±7.88; UME/VL, 4.06±7.96; p<0.0001). Moreover, the number of exacerbations as well as early morning COPD symptoms similarly diminished in all treatment groups. A comparable proportion of patients with adverse drug reactions was recorded: AB/FF, 4.07% of patients; GLY/IND, 3.52%; UME/VL, 3.64%. Conclusion: In summary, AB/FF, GLY/IND and UME/VL provided clinical benefits in lung function, quality of life and early morning COPD symptoms in a broad cohort of COPD patients under routine medical practice conditions.

As one of these countries, the case in Ethiopia is not different. The aim of this study was thus to assess reasons for hospitalization, discharge outcomes, and predictors of inpatient mortality among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Jimma University Specialized Hospital (JUSH), Jimma, Southwest Ethiopia. Prospective observational study was conducted in medical wards of JUSH from February 17th to August 17th, 2017. In this study, 101 PLWH admitted during the study period were included. To identify the predictors of mortality, multiple logistic regression analysis was employed. Of the 101 hospitalized PLWH, 62 (61.4%) of them were females and most of them (52.5%) were between 25 and 34 years of age. A majority (79.2%) of the study participants were known HIV patients, before their admission. Tuberculosis (24.8%), infections of the nervous system (18.8%), and pneumonia (9.9%) comprised more than half of the reasons for hospitalization. Moreover, drug-related toxicity was a reason for hospitalization of 6 (5.9%) patients. Outcomes of hospitalization indicated that the overall inpatient mortality was 18 (17.8%). The median CD4 cell counts for survivors and deceased patients were 202 cells/L (IQR, 121-295 cells/L) and 70 cells/L (IQR, 42-100 cells/L), respectively.

FeistleObjective: To evaluate real-world persistence and adherence in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) receiving a fixed-dose combination of dutasteride plus tamsulosin (DUT-TAM FDC) versus -blocker plus 5- reductase inhibitor (AB/5ARI) free-combination therapy. Materials and methods: This retrospective, observational cohort study utilized the German IMS LRx (IQVIA) database. Patients  45 years old with BPH receiving DUT-TAM FDC or AB/5ARI free-combination therapy from July 1, 2011 to November 30, 2017 were included. Data were analyzed for 48 months from index date (date of first prescription). Persistence, measured as time to discontinuation (defined as a 90-day gap in therapy), was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves (log-rank tests). Adherence, measured as medication possession ratio (MPR), was based on a comparison of mean prescribing duration and expected treatment duration. Results: A total of 141,667 patients were included (DUT-TAM FDC, n = 86,057; free AB/5ARI: n = 55,610). Small differences in persistence were observed between treatment arms. At month 12, 41.8% of DUT-TAM FDC-treated and 41.0% of AB/5ARI free-combination therapy-treated patients were persistent; at month 24, 28.2% and 27.1% were persistent, respectively. A higher proportion of DUT-TAM FDC-treated patients had MPR  0.80,  0.75 and  0.70 compared with AB/5ARI free-combination therapy (p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion: Small differences observed in persistence between treatment arms may not translate to meaningful clinical relevance. Adherence was significantly better in the FDC arm, which may be clinically relevant as improved adherence is associated with better outcomes.

F. D. Di Stefano et al.Purpose. A novel fixed-dose combination of 150 mg of econazole with 6 mg of benzydamine formulated in vaginal ovules was investigated in a randomised, double-blind, four-parallel group, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic Phase I study in healthy women. Methods. The fixed-dose combination was compared to econazole and benzydamine single-drug formulations and with placebo after daily applications for 3 consecutive days. Safety and tolerability were evaluated recording the adverse drug reactions, local and general tolerability scores, clinical laboratory assays, and vital signs. Econazole, benzydamine, and its metabolite benzydamine N-oxide pharmacokinetics were investigated after single and multiple applications. Results. Local reactions were generally absent. Pruritus and pain at the application site were infrequently reported. According to the subjects' evaluations, the overall tolerability of the ovules was rated as excellent or good. No significant effect of any treatment on laboratory parameters, vital signs, body weight, vaginal pH, or ECG was observed. Very low econazole, benzydamine, and benzydamine-N-oxide concentrations were measured in plasma, though quantifiable in almost all samples. Conclusion. The tested fixed-dose combination showed a good safety profile consistently with the known tolerability of both active substances. In addition, the confirmed low bioavailability of the drugs excludes the possibility of any accumulation effects and limits the risk of undesired systemic effects.

Objective: This study was designed to demonstrate the noninferiority of therapy with fixed-dose rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe formulations versus fixed dose simvastatin and ezetimibe formulations for reduction of LDL-C levels in Brazilian patients with hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. Methods: Phase III, multicenter, randomized, parallel, open-label, noninferiority study that included male and female participants (aged 21–80 years) with hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. After a 1-week screening period with washout of lipid-lowering medications when needed, patients were treated with simvastatin 20 mg/d for 5 weeks. Participants with LDL-C levels 100 mg/dL after the initial treatment were submitted to a 1-week washout period, and then randomized 1:1 to receive either combined rosuvastatin 10 mg + ezetimibe 10 mg (R/E) or simvastatin 20 mg + ezetimibe 10 mg (S/E) for 4 weeks and, if they still did not achieve the stipulated target, doses were readjusted to rosuvastatin 20 mg + ezetimibe 10 mg or simvastatin 40 mg + ezetimibe 10 mg, respectively, for 4 weeks. Results: One hundred twenty-nine participants were enrolled, including 66 in R/E and 63 in S/E. At the end of simvastatin 20 mg treatment period, mean LDL-C values were 124.79 mg/dL and 121.27 mg/dL for participants randomized to R/E and S/E arms, respectively. After 4 weeks of R/E 10 mg + 10 mg or S/E 20 mg + 10 mg combined treatments, adjusted mean LDL-C values were 74.21 mg/dL and 85.58 mg/dL, respectively (P = 0.0005), and after 9 weeks, with dose adjustment to R/E 20 mg + 10 mg in 6 patients and to S/E 40 mg +10 mg in 19 patients, LDL-C adjusted mean values were 75.29 mg/dL and 86.62 mg/dL, respectively (P = 0.0006). There was a statistically significant difference between the association R/E and S/E (P = 0.0013) in percentage change of LDL-C after 9 weeks of combined treatments. The adjusted mean difference was estimated at –10.32% (95% CI, –16.94% to –3.70%). The LDL-C <100 mg/dL target was achieved in a significantly greater proportion of participants at week 4 in the R/E compared with the S/E arm (84.8% vs 68.2%; P = .0257), and at week 9, the proportion was 81.2% versus 73.0%, respectively (P = 0.23). LDL­C <70 mg/dL was achieved at a significantly greater proportion in the R/E arm, both at week 4 (45.4% vs 15.9%; P = 0.003) and week 9 (40.9% vs 15.9%; P = 0.0017). A statistically significant difference at week 9 (P = 0.0106) was observed in fasting blood glucose in the R/E arm, but the overall incidence of adverse events was not significantly different between groups. Conclusions: Rosuvastatin and ezetimibe fixed dose combination in both 10 mg/10 mg and 20 mg/10 mg doses, respectively, provided significantly lower levels of LDL-C compared with simvastatin and ezetimibe in doses of 20 mg/10 mg and 40 mg/10 mg, respectively. The fixed-dose combinations were both effective and well tolerated in this Brazilian study population. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01420549.

Due to lack of chromophore in the molecule, the detection of AMK during analysis is a challenge. Thus, pre and post-column derivatization techniques are generally used for AMK estimation. This review focuses on different analytical methods used for detection and quantification of AMK in pure or fixed dose combination pharmaceutical formulations and biological samples. Various reported methods described in the literature include high-performance liquid chromatography techniques, pulsed electrochemical detection techniques, Chemiluminescence techniques, Capillary electrophoresis and immunological methods. High-performance-liquid-chromatography based methods with UV/Vis spectrophotometric, fluorescence and mass spectrometric detection are the most prevailing methods employed for the analysis of AMK. This review could be of significant importance in the area of future AMK analytical method development studies.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408347.2020.1803042;4.9;6.5;8.4;;;;;;

Suitable separation was achieved on Phenomenex Synergi C18 (250 × 4.6 mm, 4 m) using mobile phase, methanol (50%): ammonium acetate buffer (adjusted to pH 2.80) (40%): acetonitrile (10%) in an isocratic mode. The drugs were detected at 270 nm with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and the retention times were found to be 3.26, 5.42, and 7.55 minutes for lamivudine, nevirapine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, respectively. The developed method was validated per ICH guidelines. Good linearity was obtained within the concentration ranges of 10-59 g/ml, 7-42 g/ml, and 15-90 g/ml with a correlation coefficient of not less than 0.990. The % RSD values for precision (intraday and interday) and accuracy studies were found to be less than 2%. The results obtained from quantitative analysis conform to USP content requirements for marketed tablet dosage forms, RICOVIR-LN, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine tablets.

MDR-TB treatment is associated with frequent adverse events (AEs). Although guidelines recommend concurrent treatment of MDR-TB and HIV, safety data on concurrent therapy are limited.Methods:We conducted a prospective observational study of MDR-TB patients with and without HIV-coinfection in South Africa between 2011 and 2015. Participants received standardized MDR-TB and HIV regimens. Participants were followed monthly for the duration of MDR-TB therapy and screened for clinical and laboratory AEs. Audiometry was performed monthly during the intensive phase; color discrimination testing was performed every 2 months.Results:We enrolled 150 HIV-infected and 56 HIV-uninfected participants. Nearly all experienced at least one clinical (93%) or laboratory (96%) AE. The most common clinical AEs were peripheral neuropathy (50%) and difficulty sleeping (48%); the most common laboratory AEs were hypokalemia (47%) and decreased creatinine clearance (46%). Among 19 clinical and lab AEs examined, there were no differences by HIV status, except for diarrhea (27% HIV-infected vs. 13% HIV-uninfected, P = 0.03). Hearing loss was experienced by 72% of participants (8% severe loss). Fourteen percent experienced color discrimination loss (4% severe loss). There were no differences in frequency or severity of hearing or vision loss by HIV status.Conclusions:AEs were common, but not more frequent or severe among MDR-TB/HIV co-infected participants receiving concurrent antiretroviral therapy.

Fixed combinations not only improve adherence by reducing the medication burden, but also decrease the total amount of potentially deleterious preservatives an eye is exposed to. Areas covered: We provide a critical review of selected evidence on both the safety and tolerability of presently available and emerging glaucoma FCs. There is convincing short-term safety and tolerability evidence on intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering FCs compared to that of monotherapies and, to a lesser degree, to that of concomitant, equivalent combination therapies. In contrast, there is a scarcity of trials evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of glaucoma FCs and no conclusive data on the reduction of adverse events with FCs. Expert opinion: It is vital for clinicians to carefully weigh the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and adherence of IOP-lowering FCs. Given the number of currently available and emerging FC therapy options in glaucoma, as well as the complexities of incorporating them in the various combination therapy regimens, successful stepwise therapy remains often elusive.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14740338.2020.1826928;6.3;6.3;6.2;;32954836;;;;

How blood pressure medications are prescribed and purchased can promote or impede adherence. Methods We used comprehensive dispensing data on prescription blood pressure medication from Symphony Health's 2017 Integrated Dataverse to assess how prescription-and payment-related factors that promote medication adherence (ie, fixed-dose combinations, generic formulations, mail order, low-cost or no-copay medications) vary across US states and census regions and across the market segments (grouped by patient age, prescriber type, and payer type) responsible for the greatest number of blood pressure medication fills. Results In 2017, 706.5 million prescriptions for blood pressure medication were filled, accounting for $29.0 billion in total spending (17.0% incurred by patients). As a proportion of all fills, factors that promoted adherence varied by state: fixed-dose combinations (from 5.8% in Maine to 17.9% in Mississippi); generic formulations (from 95.2% in New Jersey to 98.4% in Minnesota); mail order (from 4.7% in Rhode Island to 14.5% in Delaware); and lower or no copayment (from 56.6% in Utah to 72.8% in California). Furthermore, mean days' supply per fill (from 43.1 in Arkansas to 63.8 in Maine) and patient spending per therapy year (from $38 in Hawaii to $76 in Georgia) varied. Concentration of adherence factors differed by market segment. Patients aged 18 to 64 with a primary care physician prescriber and Medicaid coverage had the lowest concentration of fixed-dose combination fills, mean days' supply per fill, and patient spending per therapy year. Patients aged 65 years or older with a primary care physician prescriber and commercial insurance had the highest concentration of fixeddose combinations fills and mail order fills.

Method: This post-marketing surveillance (NCT02850978) was a 52-week observational study of Japanese patients with COPD who required LAMA/LABA to relieve the symptoms associated with obstructive airway impairment and received TIO/OLO for the first time. The primary and secondary outcomes were the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and COPD assessment test (CAT) total score (12 weeks), respectively. Further outcomes included patient's global rating (PGR), physician's global assessment (PGA), changes from baseline in forced vital capacity (FVC) and 1-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) over a 52-week period, etc. Results: The safety analysis set included 1273 COPD patients with all severities (mild, 20.42%; moderate, 49.10%; severe, 23.57%; very severe, 6.05%). Fifty (3.93%) patients reported ADRs (most common: thirst, 0.55% [7/1273]); five (0.39%) reported serious ADRs (angina pectoris, cardiac failure, ileus, sudden death, dementia [0.08%; n = 1 each]). Use of TIO/OLO led to improvements in CAT (-4.2±8.2; mean change ±standard deviation), FVC (0.12±0.47L), and FEV1(0.08±0.29L) at 52 weeks. Most patients showed improved PGR (65.59%-70.58%) and PGA (61.44%-65.58%) in Weeks 4-52. Conclusion: There were no new safety concerns or precautions for long-term use. The efficacy of TIO/OLO in COPD patients with various severity in a clinical setting was confirmed.";None;0.0;0.1;0.1;;;;;;

Herein we report results of a long-term survival analysis of participants in CENTAUR. In CENTAUR, adults with ALS were randomized 2:1 to PB-TURSO or placebo. Participants completing the 6-month (24-week) randomized phase were eligible to receive PB-TURSO in the open-label extension. An all-cause mortality analysis (35-month maximum follow-up post-randomization) incorporated all randomized participants. Participants and site investigators were blinded to treatment assignments through the duration of follow-up of this analysis. Vital status was obtained for 135 of 137 participants originally randomized in CENTAUR. Median overall survival was 25.0 months among participants originally randomized to PB-TURSO and 18.5 months among those originally randomized to placebo (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.92; P =.023). Initiation of PB-TURSO treatment at baseline resulted in a 6.5-month longer median survival as compared with placebo.

There is therefore considerable interest in understanding how to optimize the use of our existing classes of bronchodilator and in identifying novel classes of bronchodilator drugs. However, new classes of bronchodilator have proved challenging to develop because many of these have no better efficacy than existing classes of bronchodilator and often have unacceptable safety profiles. Recent research has shown that optimization of bronchodilation occurs when both arms of the autonomic nervous system are affected through antagonism of muscarinic receptors to reduce the influence of parasympathetic innervation of the lung and through stimulation of b2-adrenoceptors (b2-ARs) on. airway smooth muscle with b2-AR–selective agonists to mimic the sympathetic influence on the lung. This is currently achieved by use of fixed-dose combinations of inhaled long-acting b2-adrenoceptor agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists (LAMAs). Due to the distinct mechanisms of action of LAMAs and LABAs, the additive/synergistic effects of using these drug classes together has been extensively investigated. More recently, so-called “triple inhalers” containing fixed-dose combinations of both classes of bronchodilator (dual bronchodilation) and an inhaled corticosteroid in the same inhaler have been developed. Furthermore, a number of so-called “bifunctional drugs” having two different primary pharmacological actions in the same molecule are under development. This review discusses recent advancements in knowledge on bronchodilators and bifunctional drugs for the treatment of asthma and COPD. Significance Statement——Since our last review in 2012, there has been considerable research to identify novel classes of bronchodilator drugs, to further understand how to optimize the use of the existing classes of bronchodilator, and to better understand the role of bifunctional drugs in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.;http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/lookup/doi/10.1124/pr.119.018150;38.8;34.5;34.4;;31848208;;;;

An optimal approach in BRPC is yet to be defined. Methods and Materials: Patients with BRPC, confirmed adenocarcinoma, performance status 1, and adequate organ function enrolled in a single-institution, phase 2 trial. Patients received FOLFIRINOX × 6 cycles, then radiation therapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions) concurrent with fixed-dose rate gemcitabine (1 g/m2 over 100 minutes) followed by 2 additional gemcitabine infusions. Computed tomography scans were performed at 2-month intervals during treatment. Patients without distant disease were offered surgical exploration. The primary objective was R0 resection rate with an alternate hypothesis of 55%. Secondary objectives included median progression-free survival (PFS), median overall survival (OS), response rate, and safety. The trial registration number is NCT01661088. Results: Twenty-five patients with median age of 60 years (range, 47-77 years) enrolled from November 2011 through January 2017. Twenty-one (84%) completed FOLFIRINOX and 19 (76%) completed all protocol therapy. Treatment-related grade 3 to 4 toxicities included neutropenia (40%), nausea and vomiting (28%), diarrhea (16%), and fatigue (12%). Eighteen patients (72%) underwent laparotomy, 13 (52%) were resected (all R0). The median PFS and OS in 25 patients were 13.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.3-24.7) and 24.4 months (95% CI, 12.6-40.0), respectively. For resected patients, median PFS was 21.6 months (95% CI, 8.2-37.1) and OS was 37.1 months (95% CI, 15.4–not reached). Conclusions: Neoadjuvant therapy with FOLFIRINOX, followed by intensity modulated radiation therapy concurrent with fixed-dose-rate gemcitabine in BRPC is feasible and tolerated. Although the alternate hypothesis was not met, the OS of the resected cohort was favorable.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0360301619337460;8.4;8.3;8.6;S0360301619337460;31494181;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0360301619337460;;

To compare the effects of 3-month therapy with a fixed-dose combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril) and a thiazide-like diuretic (indapamide) in genetically heterogeneous subgroups of patients with hypertension (HTN) for assessing the prospects of using genetic testing for choosing the antihy-pertensive treatment regimen. Material and methods. Forty-one patients with grade 1-2 HTN with insufficient effectiveness of previous antihypertensive therapy and 20 healthy individuals were examined to compare the prevalence of gene polymorphism in the Rostov Oblast. Patients with HTN underwent standard diagnostic tests, as well as a molecular genetic test to determine the most clinically significant polymorphic genes involved in the pathogenesis of HTN. moni-Results. A relationship was found between the clinical and morphofunctional characteristics of HTN in patients with polymorphisms of AGT, AGTR2, CYP11B2, GNB3, and NOS3-786 genes, of which 3 polymorphic genes (AGT, AGTR2, CYP11B2) encode the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. The effectiveness of using a combination of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor agent with a thia-zide-like diuretic as an initial antihypertensive therapy was evaluated. An analysis showed that fixed-dose combination of perindopril (10,0) and indapamide (2,5) (Noliprel A Bi-forte) in genetically heterogeneous subgroups of HTN patients displays a more pronounced antihypertensive and organ-protective effects in individuals with the mutant allele 704C of AGT T704C polymorphism. A significant decrease in blood pressure was demonstrated according to standard 24-hour moni-toring (p<0,05). A significant decrease in the left ventricular mass index (p=0,0001), as well as a significant increase in the ratio of peak mitral flow velocity in early and late diastole (VE/VA) (p=0,0024) were showed. There was a positive effect of therapy on arterial stiffness parameters: a decrease of the pulse wave velocity (p=0,0035), vascular age (p=0,00002) and reflection index (Ri) (p=0,000001), compared with non-carriers of mutant allele 704C of AGT gene. Conclusion. The results obtained indicate the promise of using genetic approaches to develop a personalized drug treatment strategy for HTN patients in order to increase its effectiveness.;https://russjcardiol.elpub.ru/jour/article/view/3911;0.3;0.4;0.5;;;3911;;;

They are responsible for various functions like attention, memory, reasoning and in turn helps to improve knowledge. Cognitive impairment is majorly seen in elderly as the brain is prone to neuro degradation. It may also occur in young adults due to poor diet or exercise. Improving cognition is of utmost importance and can be done by the use of cognition enhancers like Nootropics. This class of drugs is said to act by various mechanisms, which in turn leads to the betterment of the neurotransmission in the brain. They may act on acetylcholine, Gamma Butyric Acid, on the beta amyloid receptor or on NMDA. This research emphasis on the enhancement of cognition along with treating various neurodegenerative diseases like dementia, Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s. Nootropic drugs are chosen for this formulation as they exhibit a rationale in combination with each other since they follow distinctive route of mechanism to treat the diseases. They also show action by preventing the worsening of the disease and by curing the disease. Nootropics are known to have low toxicity leading to their wide acceptance and research. As compared to other combination of nootropic, in this combination, the side effects are reduced of one in presence of the other and show a much higher bioavailability. They cross the blood brain barrier and central nervous system half-life is longer as compared to the systemic half-life owing to their efficacy and superiority over other nootropics when it comes to treating cognition Fixed dose combination of these nootropic drugs is desired and the dose can’t be varied as they no longer show their effect if not used in the exact dose required. The dosage of this varied drug depends on the severity of the disease and patient condition. The research has helped to achieve the reduction in the total tablet mass from 1500 mg to 1420 mg with the use of few excipients. This made it easier for patients to swallow the tablet easily due to an oval shape of the tablet formulation.;https://pharmascope.org/ijrps/article/view/2374;0.2;0.2;0.2;;;;;;

Results: The per-protocol set included 349 patients (BBFC, n=172; BRINZ+BRIM, n=177). The mean±standard deviation diurnal IOP at baseline was 24.6±2.66 mmHg in both groups. At Month 3, the least square mean±standard error change in diurnal IOP from baseline was 7.2 ±0.34 mmHg and 7.3±0.34 mmHg with BBFC and BRINZ+BRIM, respectively (between-group difference: 0.1 mmHg [95% CI 0.5, 0.7]). In the BBFC and BRINZ+BRIM groups, 53.3% and 55.0% of patients achieved a diurnal IOP <18 mmHg, and 43.2% and 37.4% of patients, respectively, achieved a mean diurnal IOP reduction >30% from baseline at Month 3. Ocular AEs were reported in 28.7% (BBFC) and 22.5% (BRINZ+BRIM) of patients; conjunctival hyperemia was the most frequent ocular AE (BBFC, 6.4%; BRINZ+BRIM, 6.8%). Non-ocular AEs were reported in 32.4% (BBFC) and 30.4% (BRINZ+BRIM) of patients. Conclusion: The study findings demonstrate that the efficacy of twice-daily BBFC was non-inferior to BRINZ+BRIM in patients with OAG/OHT. The safety profile of BBFC was similar to that of BRINZ+BRIM.";https://www.dovepress.com/comparison-of-the-intraocular-pressure-lowering-efficacy-and-safety-of-peer-reviewed-article-OPTH;3.3;3.4;3.3;;;;;;

The use of fluticasone propionate/formoterol fumarate dihydrate (FP/FORM) pressurized metered-dose (pMDI, Flutiform® ), a type of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting 2 agonist (LABA) fixed-dose combination, has been associated with lower oral corticosteroid-requiring exacerbation rates than other ICS/LABA fixed-dose combinations, fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate (FP/SAL) and budesonide/formoterol fumarate (BUD/FORM). This study presents the first budget impact analysis of drug and exacerbation management cost savings associated with the increased access to FP/FORM compared to the currently available ICS/LABAs for treating moderate-to-severe asthma in Singapore. Patients and Methods: A budget impact model showed changes to annual drug and exacerbation costs over 5 years for patients with moderate-to-severe asthma in Singapore, following the inclusion of FP/FORM on a government subsidy list. The eligible patient population was identified based on national statistics data. Different treatment costs pertaining to the population were applied according to the usage data (IQVIA Singapore National Sales Data) for different scenarios. Drug costs were obtained from public-sector hospitals. Exacerbation management costs were obtained from literature searches. Results: The analysis showed that increased access to FP/FORM as a result of switching from FP/SAL could help achieve drug (S$1,042,289) and exacerbation management (S $223,550) cost savings over 5 years. In the scenario where patients switched from BUD/ FORM, greater drug (S$2,572,797) and exacerbation management (S$256,781) cost savings were observed over 5 years. Conclusion: The analysis provides a perspective that the increased access to FP/FORM could help achieve drug and exacerbation cost savings for the treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma.;https://www.dovepress.com/perspective-on-the-budgetary-impact-of-fpform-pmdi-on-treatment-and-ma-peer-reviewed-article-CEOR;2.8;2.5;2.6;;;;;;

The springs are located in the fault and fold zones of the Rembang anticlinorium system. This study was designed to determine the characteristics of karst aquifers from one year of monthly spatio-temporal data on discharge parameters and physico-chemical properties (temperature, pH, EC, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3-) of the four major springs, namely Brubulan Tahunan, Sumbersemen, Brubulan Pesucen, and Sendang Sayuran. It used statistical calculations to characterize spring discharge and hydrochemical variations, as well as bivariate correlation analysis and flow-duration curve (FDC). The variability index (Iv), variability (V), and spring coefficient of variation parameters (SCVP) classified Brubulan Tahunan and Sumbersemen as springs producing stable, fairly constant discharge with low variations but characterized Brubulan Pesucen as having unstable, varying discharge with moderate variations. The results showed gently sloping hydrograph, low variations in discharge and hydrochemical properties, a relatively prolonged response of discharge and CO2-H2O-CaCO3 interaction to rainfall, and slope changes in the FDC. In other terms, although the springs are controlled by faults and folds, they have diffuse groundwater storage system in the form of densely fractured and porous media. These findings also indicate a less developed interconnected conduit, although Brubulan Pesucen is relatively more developed than Sumbersemen and Brubulan Tahunan. The geological structure and hydraulic gradient formed between the groundwater recharge and discharge areas are proven to control the amount of spring discharge actively.;https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/133056;0.9;1.6;2.2;;;;;;

Antibiotic use, especially their overuse, is the single most important driver of antibiotic resistance. Efforts have been made to reduce unnecessary drug prescriptions, but limited work is devoted to optimising dosage regimes when they are prescribed. The design of antibiotic treatments can be formulated as an optimisation problem where candidate solutions are encoded as vectors of dosages per day. The formulation naturally gives rise to competing objectives, as we want to maximise the treatment effectiveness while minimising the total drug use, the treatment duration and the concentration of antibiotic experienced by the patient. This article combines a recent mathematical model of bacterial growth including both susceptible and resistant bacteria, with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm in order to automatically design successful antibiotic treatments. We consider alternative formulations combining relevant objectives and constraints. Our approach obtains shorter treatments, with improved success rates and smaller amounts of drug than the standard practice of administering daily fixed doses. These new treatments consistently involve a higher initial dose followed by lower tapered doses.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0933365719307663;4.9;6.2;6.9;S0933365719307663;31980097;101759;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0933365719307663;;

This study was aimed to re-evaluate the reproductive and neurobehavioral effects of maternal exposure to combined imazalil (IMZ) and thiabendazole (TBZ) with fixed-dose of TBZ in mice. Methods: IMZ/TBZ were given in the diet to provide levels of 0%/0% (control), 0.0015%/0.018% (IMZ/TBZ), 0.006%/0.018% and 0.024%/0.018% during the gestation and lactation periods. Selected reproductive and neurobehavioral parameters were measured in the F1 generation. Results: No adverse effect of IMZ/TBZ was observed in litter size, litter weight, or sex ratio at birth. Concerning behavioral developmental parameters, the cliff avoidance on PND 7 of male offspring was restrained significantly in the treatment groups in a dose-related manner. Exploratory behavior examination indicated that the average time of rearing significantly lengthened in the high-dose group of male offspring. After weaning, the average time of rearing in exploratory behavior lengthened in a significant dose-related trend in adult females of the F1 generation. Spontaneous behavior examination indicated that the average speed decreased significantly through 120 min in the high-dose group of the F1-generation males. In females, the average time of rearing lengthened significantly through 120 min in the high-dose group. In the longitudinal patterns, the parallel lines of the control and treatment groups indicated a significant distance in the average time of rearing in the F1-generation females. Conclusions: The results from two combined exposure studies of IMZ/TBZ suggest that TBZ concentrations have caused major effects on exploratory and spontaneous behavior.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bdr2.1793;0.3;1.3;2.3;;;;;;

Due to the rarity of this neoplasm, its molecular pathogenesis has not been fully elaborated. A previous series of 13 cases reported that 38% contained mutations of genes encoding proteins involved in negative regulation of NF-B. NF-B is a family of transcription factors regulated through multiple cellular processes known as the canonical and noncanonical pathways. Here we present the case of a 62-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain and systemic symptoms and was found to have a mass in the porta hepatis. Fine needle aspiration cytology demonstrated a spindle cell neoplasm with vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli with admixed lymphocytes. Surgical resection showed an intranodal, 7.3 × 5.5 × 3.5 cm, solid mass composed of plump, spindle to histiocytoid cells with ovoid nuclei and small, prominent nucleoli arranged in a whorled and fascicular pattern. The lesional cells stained positively for CD21, CD23, and CD35 by immunohistochemistry, consistent with a diagnosis of FDCS. Next-generation sequencing revealed pathologic mutations in three genes involved in NF-B regulation pathways: NFKBIA, TNFAIP3, and TRAF3. A pathologic TP53 mutation was also identified. This case report supports prior associations of the NF-B pathway dysregulation and FDCS. Additionally, it is the first reported FDCS case with TRAF3 mutation as well as the first reported case to suggest disruption in both the canonical and noncanonical NF-B pathways in the same lesion.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/dc.24584;2.2;2.1;2.0;;;;;;

Our previous research showed that dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) have a strong proliferation capacity and can produce abundant amounts of EVs to meet the requirements for use in vitro and in vivo. DPSCs derived EVs (DPSCs-EVs) are evaluated for their effect on reducing haematopoietic damage. Haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) numbers and function were assessed by flow cytometry, peripheral blood cell counts, histology and bone marrow transplantation. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) was used as a reference for evaluating the efficiency of EVs. miRNA microarray was employed to find out the changes of miRNA expression after cells being irradiated in vivo and the role they may play in mitigation the radiation caused injury. We observed the effect of DPSCs-EVs on promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and FDC-P1 cells in vitro. We found that DPSCs-EVs and EGF could comparably inhibit the decrease in WBC, CFU count and KSL cells in vivo. We also verified that EVs could accelerate the recovery of long-term HSCs. In summary, DPSCs-EVs showed an apoptosis resistant effect on HUVECs and FDC-P1 cells after radiation injury in vitro. EVs from DPSCs were comparable to EGF in their ability to regulate haematopoietic regeneration after radiation injury in vivo. Radiation could alter the expression of some miRNAs in bone marrow cells, and EVs could correct these changes to some extent.

This bifunctional agent has a number of unique pharmacokinetic features: the longest duration of action, high lipophilicity and maximum efficiency in PPAR activation. The results of numerous studies confirmed the high efficacy of telmisartan and the ability to control blood pressure during the day and the early-morning hours compared to other antihypertensive drugs. The main pleutrophic effects of telmisartan have been proven at most stages of the cardiovascular and renal continuum, the main of which are a decrease in insulin resistance, an adiponectin levels increase, an improvement of endothelial function, angioprotective and renoprotective effects, and the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. The ability of telmisartan to improve prognosis of patients with high cardiovascular risk and to reduce mortality and the number of cardiovascular complications has been proven. Based on the data of large-scale studies, the possibilities of using telmisartan (80 mg/day) were considered, including in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, as the most effective dual fixed-dose combination and one of the main modern antihypertensive strategies.;https://cardiovascular.elpub.ru/jour/article/view/2453;0.7;0.6;0.8;;;;;;

Although the combination is the focus, safety profile of the new agent alone must be explored. Therefore, many trials have both monotherapy and add-on combination therapy arms. Finding the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) for the new agent in both arms is critical. Traditional oncology dose-finding methods and MTD estimation algorithm do not handle the correlation and interplay between the two arms and the selected MTDs may contradict with each other. To overcome these issues, we applied a two-dimensional pool-adjacent-violators algorithm to MTD estimation and modified the standard Bayesian optimal interval design (BOIN) to allow for information flow between arms during dose-finding. We also showed that a naïve adaptation of standard BOIN that is much simpler to implement demonstrated empirically similar performance. These new approaches were assessed with simulations and demonstrated improvement for trials with both monotherapy and add-on combination therapy arms. Albeit proposed in the context with immunotherapy as the backbone drug, our approaches can be applied to any new agent in combination with a fixed dose of another drug.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was carried out in a private hospital in Saudi Arabia. Cost analysis and patterns of outpatient and inpatient antihypertensive drugs used among hypertensive patients between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2019 were investigated, including incidence, prevalence, duration of use of therapy, class of antihypertensive drugs and therapy for cost-effective use. Key findings: Monotherapy (78.32%) was leading trends of antihypertensive therapy that followed fixed dose combination with or without multidrug therapy (21.68%). The most frequent antihypertensive class to be prescribed was nonselective beta-blockers (39.36%) followed by calcium channel blockers (16.51%). The status in terms of cost utilized average per unit was the highest for telmisartan (3.371 (0.90) SR (USD)). The propranolol was most cost-effective (average cost per unit 1.43 (0.38) SR) in relative to the other antihypertensive prescribed. Conclusion: Our study suggested that the prescription pattern of drugs used for the treatment of hypertension adhered with the JNC 8 guidelines. Monotherapy was reliably more recommended in the initial stages of hypertension. Higher percentage of patients (78.32%) was found to be on monotherapy. The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) has overwhelmed for fixation of prices of drugs.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jphs.12372;0.9;1.0;1.0;;;;;;

All rights reserved.Importance: Short-term infusions of single vasodilators, usually given in a fixed dose, have not improved outcomes in patients with acute heart failure (AHF). Objective: To evaluate the effect of a strategy that emphasized early intensive and sustained vasodilation using individualized up-titrated doses of established vasodilators in patients with AHF. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, open-label blinded-end-point trial enrolling 788 patients hospitalized for AHF with dyspnea, increased plasma concentrations of natriuretic peptides, systolic blood pressure of at least 100 mm Hg, and plan for treatment in a general ward in 10 tertiary and secondary hospitals in Switzerland, Bulgaria, Germany, Brazil, and Spain. Enrollment began in December 2007 and follow-up was completed in February 2019. Interventions: Patients were randomized 1:1 to a strategy of early intensive and sustained vasodilation throughout the hospitalization (n = 386) or usual care (n = 402). Early intensive and sustained vasodilation was a comprehensive pragmatic approach of maximal and sustained vasodilation combining individualized doses of sublingual and transdermal nitrates, low-dose oral hydralazine for 48 hours, and rapid up-titration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or sacubitril-valsartan. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality or rehospitalization for AHF at 180 days. Results: Among 788 patients randomized, 781 (99.1%; median age, 78 years; 36.9% women) completed the trial and were eligible for primary end point analysis. Follow-up at 180 days was completed for 779 patients (99.7%). The primary end point, a composite of all-cause mortality or rehospitalization for AHF at 180 days, occurred in 117 patients (30.6%) in the intervention group (including 55 deaths [14.4%]) and in 111 patients (27.8%) in the usual care group (including 61 deaths [15.3%]) (absolute difference for the primary end point, 2.8% [95% CI, -3.7% to 9.3%]; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.83-1.39]; P =.59). The most common clinically significant adverse events with early intensive and sustained vasodilation vs usual care were hypokalemia (23% vs 25%), worsening renal function (21% vs 20%), headache (26% vs 10%), dizziness (15% vs 10%), and hypotension (8% vs 2%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with AHF, a strategy of early intensive and sustained vasodilation, compared with usual care, did not significantly improve a composite outcome of all-cause mortality and AHF rehospitalization at 180 days.

Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.A missense mutation in RHOA encoding p.Gly17 Val has been reported to occur frequently in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). Here, we describe a murine model which expresses the human RHOA mutant gene product in a T-cell specific manner and develops AITL-like symptoms. Most transgenic mice feature with latency one or two enlarged lymph nodes characterized by aberrant lymph node architecture, extensive lymphocytic infiltration, extrafollicular meshwork of follicular dendritic cells (FDC) and arborized endothelial venules. Importantly, we provide evidence for expansion of PD-1+ follicular helper T (Tfh) cells which are the neoplastic cells of AITL. In addition, we saw proliferation of B-cells leading to hypergammaglobulinemia and the presence of dominant T cell clonal populations. Transplantation of lymph node cells to immunocompromised mice partly recreated lymphadenopathy after a long latency and with low penetrance suggesting that cells have undergone partial transformation to a premalignant state. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that the gene expression pattern within affected lymph nodes of the mice closely resembles that of AITL patients with the identical RHOA p.Gly17 Val mutation. The murine model should, therefore, be useful in dissecting pathogenesis of AITL at the molecular level particularly for the cases with the RHOA p.Gly17Val mutation.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2162402X.2020.1746553;5.9;7.2;9.2;;;1746553;;;

Broad substrate specificity of serratiopeptidase makes it suitable for detergent and food processing industries The protein shows potent anti-inflammatory, anti-edemic, analgesic, antibiofilm activity and sold as an individual or fixed-dose enteric-coated tablets combined with other drugs. Although controversial, serratiopeptidase as drug is used in the treatment of chronic sinusitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, sprains, torn ligaments, and postoperative inflammation. Since the native producer of serratiopeptidase is a pathogenic microorganism, the current production methods need to be replaced by alternative approaches. Heterologous expression of serratiopeptidase in E. coli was tried before but not found suitable due to the limited yield, and other expression related issues due to its inherent proteolytic activity such as cytotoxicity, cell death, no expression, minimal expression, or inactive protein accumulation. Results: Recombinant expression of mature form serratiopeptidase in E. coli seems toxic and resulted in the failure of transformation and other expression related issues. Although E. coli C43(DE3) cells, express protein correctly, the yield was compromised severely. Optimization of protein expression process parameters such as nutrient composition, induction point, inducer concentration, post-induction duration, etc., caused significant enhancement in serratiopeptidase production (57.9 ± 0.73% of total cellular protein). Expressed protein formed insoluble, enzymatically inactive inclusion bodies, and gave 40-45 mg/l homogenous (> 98% purity) biologically active and conformationally similar serratiopeptidase to the commercial counterpart upon refolding and purification. Conclusion: Expression of mature serratiopeptidase in E. coli C43(DE3) cells eliminated the protein expression associated with toxicity issues. Further optimization of process parameters significantly enhanced the overexpression of protein resulting in the higher yield of pure and functionally active recombinant serratiopeptidase. The biological activity and conformational features of recombinant serratiopeptidase were very similar to the commercially available counterpart suggesting it-a potential biosimilar of therapeutic and industrial relevance.[Figure not available: see fulltext.];https://microbialcellfactories.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12934-019-1267-x;6.5;6.9;7.4;;31847856;215;;;

Study Design: Results from prospective, open-label pharmacokinetic studies among Chinese and historical data from other race/ethnicities. Patients: Pharmacokinetics of six commonly used antiretroviral drugs, including zidovudine, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, nevirapine, efavirenz and lopinavir/ritonavir, was evaluated in HIV-infected Chinese patients and compared with historical data from other race/ethnicities. Analysis: Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed at the steady state among HIV-infected Chinese patients. Safety data were collected during the follow-up. The pharmacokinetic parameters including maximal concentrations (Cmax), area-under-curve (AUC) and clearance (Cl/F) from the Chinese patients were compared to the historic data from other race/ethnicities. Results: Current evidence, though limited, suggested that these antiretroviral agents were generally safe and effective among HIV-infected Chinese patients. However, compared with other racial groups, Chinese patients exhibited higher Cmax, AUC and lower Cl/F for most of the agents, and the incidences of adverse reactions, for example, liver toxicity, rash, and bone health, were more frequent. Conclusions: These pharmacokinetic differences suggest that lower dosages for commonly prescribed antiretroviral drugs in China might be appropriate to reduce drug-related adverse reactions, while maintain the antiviral efficacy.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/phar.2333;5.7;5.9;6.0;;31550053;;;;

Formulation (emulsion) was prepared using dry gum method (continental method), by using pestle and mortar. The formulation was characterized by performing stability studies which includes flocculation and creaming, cracking, phase inversion and accelerated studies (temperature and light). In-vivo pharmacological evaluation of Bombyx mori coccon shell extract, Flaxseed oil, CoQ10 and its fixed dose combination (FDC) were then performed. Results obtained indicates that developed FDC and extract, Oil, CoQ10 passed all stability tests and significantly prevented drug induced increase in serum levels of AST, ALT, LDH, Creatinine and lipid profile (TC, LDL, VLDL and TG) and increases the levels of HDL and antioxidant parameters—SOD, GSH and CAT (in heart tissue). It also lowered the doxorubicin induced increase in heart weight due to hypertrophy. These results were also confirmed by histopathology. The results of this study strongly indicate the cardioprotective effect of fixed dose combination of BME, Flaxseed oil and CoQ10 against doxorubicin induced myocardial toxicity.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13596-019-00360-6;0.8;0.8;1.2;;;;;;

Methods A retrospective cross sectional study was done on 19,525 HIV patients on ART. Data were collected using a data retrieval checklist from a database. All eligible data in the database were exported to Microsoft excel 2010 and then data verification and filtration were done before exporting to STATA 14.0 for analysis. Factors associated with recent CD-4 count were modeled by using Generalized Linear Model poison family. Results Among the patients with advanced HIV infection (< 200 CD-4 T-cell/ mm3) at baseline, only 28.35%, 95% CI (27.45–29.26) of them had immunological recovery ( 500 T-cells/mm3). Only 2.14%, 95%CI (1.94%- 2.35%) of the patients had immunological failure. Baseline CD-4 count (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) = 1.0007, 95%CI = 1.00069–1.00078), patients from military health care facility (IRR = 1.11, 95%CI = 1.06–1.16), good adherence (IRR = 1.12, 95%CI = 1.04–1.21) and viral load suppression (IRR = 1.31, 95%CI = 1.28–1.33) were positively associated with recent CD-4 count in the full model. Whereas, being male (IRR = 0.85, 95%CI = 0.83–0.86), patients with on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) regimen of 1e (TDF-3TC-EFV), 2f (AZT-3TC-ATV/r), and 2h (TDF-3TC-ATV/r) (IRR = 0.92, 95%CI = 0.91–0.94), (IRR = 0.65, 95%CI = 0.55–0.76) and (IRR = 0.71, 95%CI = 0.63–0.81) respectively were negatively associated with the recent CD-4 count in the full model. Conclusions Immunological recovery was achieved by 1/3 of the patients despite being on highly active ART (HAART). Therefore, intensive adherence counseling, follow-up and support should be focused on patients with viral non suppression to enhance immunological recovery.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0226293;5.7;5.4;5.2;;31830095;e0226293;;;

A multicenter cohort study was conducted in Thailand and Indonesia. Adolescents aged 10-25 years who were on antiretroviral treatment (ART), had virologic suppression (HIV RNA<400 copies/mL within the past 6 months), and had no history of chronic hepatitis B/C infection were enrolled. Participants were pre-classified into 2 subgroups (1:1 ratio) as participants with history of elevated versus normal aminotransferase enzymes. NAFLD was defined as hepatic steatosis (any severity) evaluated by liver ultrasonography. Significant hepatic fibrosis was defined as liver stiffness 7.4 kPa evaluated by transient elastography. Participants who met the criteria for protocol-defined NAFLD and/or hepatic fibrosis were re-assessed to evaluate disease progression (persistent versus transient hepatic abnormalities) at one year later. Of 120 participants, 62 (51.7%) were male, 7 (5.8%) had central obesity, and 19 (15.8%) had insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR] <3.16). At enrollment, the median age and duration of ART (IQR) were 17.0 (14.6-19.2) years and 10.5 (7.1-12.0) years, respectively. Persistent hepatic abnormalities were identified in 5/60 participants listed in the group having history of elevated aminotransferases, corresponding to the prevalence of 8.3% (95% CI: 2.8-18.4%), whereas none (0/60) were among the group having history of normal hepatic enzymes. All 5 participants had persistent aminotransferase elevation (2 episodes within the past 12 months). Baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >30 U/L (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 29.1; 95% CI: 1.7-511.8), and HOMA-IR >3.16 (aOR: 17.9; 95% CI: 1.1-289.7) were independently associated with persistent hepatic abnormalities. Among perinatally HIV-monoinfected Asian adolescents with history of elevated aminotransferase enzymes, persistent hepatic abnormalities are not uncommon. Screening for liver complications by noninvasive diagnostic tools might be considered in at risk individuals, including those with persistent ALT elevation and insulin resistance.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0226375;5.7;5.4;5.2;;31856189;e0226375;;;

OBJECTIVE: To describe the palatability and acceptability of a FDC of rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide among South African children and their caregivers in the SHINE trial. METHODS: We conducted 20 clinic observations of treatment administration, during which we conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with children and their caregivers. Data were organised thematically to report on experiences with administering and ingesting the FDC. RESULTS: Children and caregivers' experiences varied from delight to disgust. In general, participants said that the FDC compared favourably to other formulations. Pragmatic challenges such as dissolving the FDC and the time required to administer the FDC impeded caregivers' ability to integrate treatment into their daily routines. Drug manipulation was common among caregivers to improve TB treatment administration. CONCLUSION: This novel FDC appears acceptable for children, albeit with practical challenges to administration. Scale-up of FDC use should include supplementary intervention components to support caregivers.;https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/10.5588/ijtld.19.0115;4.3;4.0;3.9;;31931909;;;;

AIM: Compare the efficacy and safety (EAS) of RIV vs. standard therapy (SDTD) in a cohort of Vietnamese patients diagnosed with symptomatic, acute VTE. METHODS: An open-label, case-control, prospective study was conducted to check the efficacy and safety (EAS) of oral rivaroxaban (RIV) alone (15 mg 2 times/day for 3 weeks, then 20 mg 1 time/day) in a comparison to the standard therapy (STDT) (enoxaparin 1.0 mg/kg 2 times/day combining with vitamin K antagonist). Patients were treated for 6 months and followed-up for suspect reoccurring VTE and bleeding. RESULTS: A total 187 patients were enrolled into study. 83 were provided rivaroxaban and 104 received enoxaparin overlapping with vitamin K antagonist (VKAs). Recurrent VTE occurred in 3 (3.6%) rivaroxaban-received patients compared with 5 (4.8%) standard-treatment received patients (OR: 0.74, 95% CI, 0.17 to 3.20, p > 0.05). Major bleeding events were found in 1 (1,8%) and 4 (3.9%) cases in the RIV treated and STDT cohort, respectively (OR: 0.30, 95% CI, 0.03 to 2.76, p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The finding of this study in Vietnamese patients with acute VTE presented comparable EAS profile with RIV versus STDT, consistent with those found in global population.;https://spiroski.migration.publicknowledgeproject.org/index.php/mjms/article/view/oamjms.2019.370;0.4;0.6;0.7;;;;;;

To mitigate this risk, new antimalarial medicines should be developed as fixed-dose combinations. Assessing the pharmacodynamic interactions of potential antimalarial drug combination partners during early phases of development is essential in developing the targeted parasitological and clinical profile of the final drug product. Here, we have studied the combination of M5717, a P. falciparum translation elongation factor 2 inhibitor, and pyronaridine, an inhibitor of hemozoin formation. Our test cascade consisted of in vitro isobolograms as well as in vivo studies in the P. falciparum severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model. We also analyzed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, including genomic sequencing of recrudescent parasites. We observed no pharmacokinetic interactions with the combination of M5717 and pyronaridine. M5717 did not negatively impact the rate of kill of the faster-acting pyronaridine, and the latter was able to suppress the selection of M5717-resistant mutants, as well as significantly delay the recrudescence of parasites both with suboptimal and optimal dosing regimens.;https://aac.asm.org/content/64/4/e02181-19;7.8;7.9;8.3;;32041711;e02181-19;;;

The objective of this retrospective analysis is to ascertain from the available evidence whether ICS/fast-onset LABA administered as reliever therapy has a different dose-response relationship than maintenance fixed dose ICS/fast-onset LABA therapy in reducing risk of severe exacerbations. Methods: A systematic literature review was undertaken to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which randomised treatments included either i) budesonide/formoterol reliever monotherapy versus budesonide/formoterol fixed dose maintenance with short acting beta agonist (SABA) reliever therapy, or ii) budesonide/formoterol reliever therapy in addition to budesonide/formoterol maintenance versus higher fixed dose maintenance budesonide/formoterol with SABA as reliever therapy. Eligible studies were reviewed to allow determination of the relative potency and efficacy of the comparator regimens to reduce the risk of a severe exacerbation. Results: The one RCT of budesonide/formoterol reliever monotherapy showed a 4.6-fold (95% CI 2.9 to 7.3) greater potency than budesonide/formoterol fixed dose maintenance plus SABA reliever therapy in reducing the risk of severe exacerbations. In the one RCT that compared budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy with higher fixed dose maintenance budesonide/formoterol plus SABA reliever therapy, there was an additional 26% (95% CI 4 to 42%) reduction in severe exacerbation risk with the addition of budesonide/formoterol reliever therapy to maintenance budesonide/formoterol, despite a 25% lower total budesonide/formoterol dose. Conclusion: The limited available evidence suggests that budesonide/formoterol reliever therapy has greater potency and efficacy than budesonide/formoterol fixed dose maintenance plus SABA reliever therapy in reducing the risk of a severe exacerbation. This is an important concept which has the potential to guide clinical practice in asthma, although the small number of studies available highlights the need for further research to better define these pharmacological properties.;https://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12890-019-1014-4;4.5;3.9;3.9;;31883519;264;;;

Ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ-AVI) is a fixed-dose antibiotic approved in Europe and the United States for treating (in combination with metronidazole) cIAI in adult hospitalised patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options. The approval was based on the results of RECLAIM, a Phase III, parallel-group, comparative study (RECLAIM 1 [NCT01499290] and RECLAIM 2 [NCT01500239]). The objective of our study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole compared with 1) ceftolozane/tazobactam plus metronidazole and 2) meropenem, as an empiric treatment for the management of cIAI in Italy. Methods: A sequential, patient-level simulation model, with a 5-year time horizon and 3% annual discount rate (applied to both costs and health benefits), was developed using Microsoft Excel® to demonstrate the clinical course of the disease. The impact of resistant pathogens was included as an additional factor. Results: In the base-case analysis, the CAZ-AVI sequence (CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole followed by a colistin + tigecycline + high-dose meropenem combination after treatment failure), when compared to sequences for ceftolozane/tazobactam (ceftolozane/tazobactam plus metronidazole followed by colistin + tigecycline + high-dose meropenem after treatment failure) and meropenem (meropenem followed by colistin + tigecycline + high-dose meropenem after treatment failure), had better clinical outcomes with higher cure rates (93.04% vs. 91.52%; 92.98% vs. 90.24%, respectively), shorter hospital stays (â'† =-0.38 and â'† =-1.24 days per patient, respectively), and higher quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per patient (4.021 vs. 3.982; 4.019 vs. 3.960, respectively). The incremental cost effectiveness ratio in the CAZ-AVI sequence was 4099 and 15,574 per QALY gained versus each comparator sequence, respectively, well below the willingness-to-pay threshold of 30,000 per QALY accepted in Italy. Conclusions: The model results demonstrated that CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole could be a cost-effective alternative when compared with other antibiotic treatment options, as it is expected to provide better clinical benefits in hospitalised patients with cIAI in Italy.";https://aricjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13756-019-0652-x;3.9;4.0;4.5;;31890160;204;;;

We assessed the demographic characteristics, diagnosis date, first ART regimen, and resistance to various ART drugs. Out of 1,700 patients, 72 (4.2%) had a treatment failure. Among those with treatment failure, 51.3% were on zidovudine + lamivudine + efavirenz, 13.9% were on tenofovir + lamivudine + lopinavir/ritonavir, and 12.5% were on tenofovir + emtricitabine + efavirenz. In patients with treatment failure, the highest resistance was to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) combination (44.4%). In these patients, resistance to tenofovir (one of the NRTIs) was 29.1%. The highest treatment failure was observed among patients treated with nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV)-based regimen.

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy/safety profile of approved LABA/LAMA FDCs in COPD. A network meta-analysis was performed by linking the efficacy (forced expiratory volume in 1 s, St’ George Respiratory Questionnaire, transitional dyspnea index) and safety (cardiovascular serious adverse events) outcomes resulting from randomized controlled trials that directly compared LABA/LAMA FDCs with placebo and/or each other. The Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve Analysis (SUCRA) was performed for each single outcome (SUCRA: 1 = best, 0 = worst). The combined efficacy/safety profile was reported via the novel Improved Bidimensional SUCRA score (IBiS: the higher the value the better the treatment). Data obtained from 12,136 COPD patients (79.50% LABA/LAMA FDCs vs. placebo; 20.50% direct comparison between different LABA/LAMA FDCs) were extracted from 22 studies published between 2013 and 2019. The IBiS score showed the following rank of efficacy/safety profile: tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 g (area 66.83%) » glycopyrronium/indacaterol 15.6/27.5 g (area 40.43%) > umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5/25 g (area 30.48%)  aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 g (area 28.44%) > glycopyrronium/indacaterol 50/110 g (area 19.95%) > glycopyrronium/formoterol 14.4/9.6 g (area 11.50%). Each available LABA/LAMA FDC has a specific efficacy/safety profile that needs to be considered for personalized therapy in COPD.

This study aimed to compare the pharmacokinetics (PKs) between fixed-dose combination (FDC) of fimasartan/amlodipine 60/10 mg and the corresponding loose combination. Because of the high intra-subject variability for maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of fimasartan, a randomized, open-label, 3×3 partial replicated crossover design was adopted. Subjects received a single dose of FDC of fimasartan/amlodipine 60/10 mg or the corresponding loose combination in each period. Blood samples for PK analysis were collected up to 48 hours for fimasartan and 144 hours for amlodipine, respectively. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and its 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the FDC to the loose combination for Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable time point (AUClast) were calculated. Sixty healthy subjects were randomized, and 57 subjects completed the study. The concentration-time profiles of fimasartan and amlodipine were similar between the FDC and loose combination. The GMRs (90% CIs) of the FDC to the loose combination for Cmax and AUClast were 1.0440 (0.9202–1.1844) and 1.0412 (0.9775–1.1090) for fimasartan, and 1.0430 (1.0156–1.0711) and 1.0339 (1.0055–1.0631) for amlodipine, respectively. The GMRs and its 90% CIs for Cmax and AUClast of fimasartan and amlodipine were included not only in the scaled bioequivalence criteria but also in the conventional bioequivalence criteria.

After the introduction of ART, several studies have demonstrated comparable patient and graft outcomes between HIV-negative and HIV-positive kidney recipients. The US Congress passed the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act in 2013, which permits research in the area of HIV-positive to HIV-positive transplantation. HIV-infected living donation is also permitted under the HOPE Act. However, there is a concern regarding the safety of kidney donation in an HIV-infected person, given the risk of renal disease associated with HIV infection. We report here the case of successful kidney transplantation from HIV-positive living donor to HIV-positive recipient performed in our center on July 2012. To the best of our knowledge, this is the earliest case done in this medical context to be reported in the literature, therefore, potentially carrying several important messages to the transplantation community. In the present case, the living-donor kidney transplant was performed between a married couple infected with same strain of HIV-1, both on effective ART with efficiently suppressed viral replication and satisfactory pre-transplantation immune status.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tid.13171;3.2;2.9;3.1;;31518477;e13171;;;

To analyze the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine/indapamide/perindopril arginine (Triplixam) in a subgroup of 790 people participating in the Russian observational program DOKAZATEL`STVO without use of other antihypertensive agents. Material and methods. The analysis included 790 patients with hypertension (HTN) (men — 37,9%, mean age — 60,0±10,2 years). The drug was administrated in one of 4 recommended dosages for 3 months. We assessed the dynamics of office and home blood pressure (BP) from visit 1 to visit 4 and the frequency of achieving the target BP <140/90 mm Hg in 3 months. Results. After 3 months, office systolic BP (SBP) decreased from 163,4±14,0 to 127,2±7,8 mm Hg, diastolic BP (DBP) — from 95,7±9,5 to 78,3±6,2 mm Hg (p<0,001). Home SBP in the morning decreased from 145,9±12,3 to 128,3±7,8 mm Hg, DBP — from 86,2±7,7 to 78,4±5,6 mm Hg (p<0,001). After 3 months, target office BP (<140/90 mm Hg) was achieved in 88,4% of subjects, home BP (<135/85 mm Hg) — 73%. Conclusion.

Conventional FDC sarcomas are negative for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), whereas the inflammatory pseudotumorlike variant consistently shows EBV in the neoplastic cells. CASE SUMMARY We report two cases of inflammatory pseudotumor-like FDC sarcoma in the liver that received 3D laparoscopic right hepatectomy and open right hepatectomy separately. CONCLUSION EBV probe-based in situ hybridization and detection of immunohistochemical markers of FDC play an important role in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor-like FDC sarcoma. Complete surgical excision combined with regional lymphadenectomy may be effective in reducing the postoperative recurrence and metastasis and improving long-term survival rates.;https://www.wjgnet.com/1948-5204/full/v11/i12/1231.htm;0.4;1.4;2.0;;;;;;

Therefore, the implementation of a FDC framework is the focus in this paper. The developed approach aims at reducing the energy needs for buildings and improving indoor environment quality. It merges the benefits of multiscale representation, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Machine Learning (ML) classifiers in order to improve the efficiency of FDC in heating systems. Firstly, a multiscale decomposition is used to extract the dynamics of the systems at different scales. The multiscale representation gives several advantages for monitoring heating systems generally driven by events in different time and frequency responses. Secondly, the multiscaled data-sets are then introduced into the PCA model to extract more efficient characteristics. Thirdly, the ML algorithms are applied to the extracted and selected characteristics to deal with the problem of fault diagnosis. The FDC efficiency of the developed technique is evaluated using a simulated data extracted from heating systems.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9112110/;0;0;0;;;9112110;;true;9781728151847

The identification of such models in arid regions, in which intermittent and ephemeral streams are common, constitutes an additional challenge in statistical hydrology applications. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for the modeling of FDCs in null-flow conditions. First, we evaluated a set of flexible distributions frequently used in hydrology for modeling the entire range of observed streamflows, with a focus on the proper representation of intermittence and the description of the lower flows. Next, regional models for the parameters of the distributions were identified with the evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR) technique, which, although providing structurally complex equations, proved able to uncover the relationships between the characteristics of such parameters and catchments and, more importantly, preserve them in a cross-validation procedure. From a practical perspective, the decision-making processes involving water resources planning and management could be more coherently addressed in ungauged sites under the proposed framework, as compared to other established yet simpler modeling techniques.;http://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29HE.1943-5584.0001873;3.7;3.7;3.2;;;04019059;;;

Resident memory T cells (TRM) are present in tissues such as the lower female genital tract, but the contribution of this subset of cells to the pathogenesis and persistence of HIV remains unclear. Here, we show that cervical CD4+TRM display a unique repertoire of clusters of differentiation, with enrichment of several molecules associated with HIV infection susceptibility, longevity and self-renewing capacities. These protein profiles are enriched in a fraction of CD4+TRM expressing CD32. Cervical explant models show that CD4+TRM preferentially support HIV infection and harbor more viral DNA and protein than non-TRM. Importantly, cervical tissue from ART-suppressed HIV+ women contain high levels of viral DNA and RNA, being the TRM fraction the principal contributor. These results recognize the lower female genital tract as an HIV sanctuary and identify CD4+TRM as primary targets of HIV infection and viral persistence. Thus, strategies towards an HIV cure will need to consider TRM phenotypes, which are widely distributed in tissues.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12732-2;18.5;18.1;18.1;;31628331;4739;;;

Accumulation can even be restricted to the lymphoid tissue without neuroinvasion and clinical disease. Several experimental observations indicated that the presence of differentiated follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) in the lymphoid structures and the strain type are critical determinants of prion extraneural replication. In this context, the report that granulomatous structures apparently devoid of FDCs could support prion replication raised the question of the requirements for prion lymphotropism. The report also raised the possibility that nonlymphoid tissue-tropic prions could actually target these inflammatory structures. To investigate these issues, we examined the capacity of closely related prions, albeit with opposite lymphotropism (or FDC dependency), for establishment in experimentally-induced granuloma in ovine PrP transgenic mice. We found a positive correlation between the prion capacity to accumulate in the lymphoid tissue and granuloma, regardless of the prion detection method used. Surprisingly, we also revealed that the accumulation of prions in granulomas involved lymphoid-like structures associated with the granulomas and containing cells that stain positive for PrP, Mfge-8 but not CD45 that strongly suggest FDCs. These results suggest that the FDC requirement for prion replication in lymphoid/inflammatory tissues may be strain-dependent.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-51084-1;4.8;6.4;7.2;;31601984;14656;;;

Here, we identify a subset of lymphoid organ sinus lining macrophage (SMs) that provide a cell-cell contact portal, which facilitates the uptake of HIV-1 viral-like particles (VLPs) by FDCs and B cells in mouse lymph node. Central for portal function is the bridging glycoprotein MFG-E8. Using a phosphatidylserine binding domain and an RGD motif, MFG-E8 helps target HIV-1 VLPs to v integrin bearing SMs. Lack of MFG-E8 or integrin blockade severely limits HIV-1 VLP spread onto FDC networks. Direct SM-FDC virion transfer also depends upon short-lived FDC network abutment, likely triggered by SCSM antigen uptake. This provides a mechanism for rapid FDC loading broadening the opportunity for rare, antigen reactive follicular B cells to acquire antigen, and a means for HIV virions to accumulate on the FDC network.;https://elifesciences.org/articles/47776;10.0;10.8;10.8;;31793433;e47776;;;

However, most older PLWH (50 years) “aged” with HIV and were exposed to historical HIV care practices and older, more toxic ART. In PLWH with exposure to older and multiple ART regimens, the drug interactions between ART frequently used in treatment-experienced persons and commonly used immunosuppressants remain a significant challenge. However, the advent of newer ART classes (eg, integrase non-strand transfer inhibitors) and more advanced HIV genetic resistance testing may allow optimization of ART regimens with minimal drug interactions. Here, we present a case series of three PLWH whose complicated ART interacted (or was at risk for interacting) with their post–liver transplant immunosuppression. After a review of their proviral DNA resistance testing, they successfully transitioned onto safer integrase non-strand transfer inhibitor-containing ART regimens without viral blips or evidence of organ rejection.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tid.13174;3.2;2.9;3.1;;31520554;e13174;;;

Doravirine achieved non-inferiority when compared with efavirenz- and darunavir/ritonavir-based regimens. Fewer adverse effects, including neuropsychiatric effects were observed with doravirine compared with efavirenz. Key pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics as well as drug–drug interactions and the resistance profile were assessed in this clinical review. Doravirine is a pyridinone NNRTI with potent antiviral activity against wild-type HIV-1 virus and common NNRTI variants. Studies in healthy volunteers and HIV-infected individuals have shown that doravirine has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile for once-daily dosing, with an elimination half-life of around 15 h, median time to maximum plasma concentrations of 1–4 h, and time to steady-state concentration of 7 days. The pharmacokinetics of doravirine are not greatly influenced by sex, age, race, or hepatic impairment. Although no dose adjustment is required for doravirine in renal impairment when given as a single tablet, the fixed-dose combination tablet of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance of < 50 mL/min. Doravirine has a low potential for drug–drug interactions and does not impact on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs. However, it is metabolized via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A enzymes and is thus susceptible to interactions with CYP3A inhibitors and inducers. Strong CYP3A inhibitors can significantly increase doravirine exposure; however, this is not considered to be clinically relevant. Conversely, strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, are contraindicated with doravirine owing to a significant reduction in exposure with potential for impaired virological efficacy. Moderate CYP3A inducers, such as rifabutin, may be co-administered if the doravirine dose is increased to 100 mg twice daily. Doravirine has a unique resistance profile and has demonstrated in vitro activity against some of the most common, clinically relevant NNRTI-resistant mutations. Prevalence of baseline NNRTI resistance to doravirine appears to be low in treatment-naïve cohorts. Further data on the efficacy of doravirine in patients with previous treatment experience and/or transmitted NNRTI resistance are required to further inform its place in the current armamentarium of drugs for the treatment of HIV infection.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40262-019-00806-9;8.5;8.2;8.8;;31388941;;;;

The aim of the present network meta-analysis was to assess the comparative efficacy of all the currently available dual therapies in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Methods: A network meta-analysis (3 nodes, Bayesian method) was performed by searching for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that compared the impact of different LABA/LAMA FDCs vs. ICS/LABA FDCs on both primary and secondary endpoints. The primary endpoints were: the change from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and the risk of exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). The secondary endpoints were: peak FEV1, St’ George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI), and rescue medication use. Results: Data of 17,734 COPD patients were extracted from 16 RCTs. The length of treatment ranged from 6 weeks to 52 weeks. All LABA/LAMA FDCs, except aclidinium/formoterol, produced a statistically significant improvement compared to ICS/LABAs in trough FEV1. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) analysis indicated that umeclidinium/vilanterol, glycopyrronium/indacaterol and glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate were the most effective FDCs in improving trough FEV1. Across the FDCs analyzed for the risk of AECOPD, glycopyrronium/indacaterol significantly reduced the exacerbation risk compared to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol and resulted the most effective combination in the SUCRA analysis. Similar trend were also observed for the peak FEV1. No significant differences were detected across the investigated FDCs regarding SGRQ, TDI, and use of rescue medication. Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis show that LABA/LAMA combinations are consistently more effective than ICS/LABA FDCs for most of the evaluated outcomes. However, differences have also been observed between FDCs belonging to the same class. Across the investigated LABA/LAMA FDCs, glycopyrronium/indacaterol revealed a consistent and robust efficacy profile.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1094553919301622;4.9;4.9;4.3;S1094553919301622;31639476;101855;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1094553919301622;;

Data from mouse transmissions show that efficient infection of the host after intravenous (IV) prion exposure is dependent upon the early accumulation and amplification of the prions on stromal follicular dendritic cells (FDC) in the B cell follicles. How infectious prions are initially conveyed from the blood-stream to the FDC in the spleen is uncertain. Addressing this issue is important as susceptibility to peripheral prion infections can be reduced by treatments that prevent the early accumulation of prions upon FDC. The marginal zone (MZ) in the spleen contains specialized subsets of B cells and macrophages that are positioned to continuously monitor the blood-stream and remove pathogens, toxins and apoptotic cells. The continual shuttling of MZ B cells between the MZ and the B-cell follicle enables them to efficiently capture and deliver blood-borne antigens and antigen-containing immune complexes to splenic FDC. We tested the hypothesis that MZ B cells also play a role in the initial shuttling of prions from the blood-stream to FDC. MZ B cells were temporarily depleted from the MZ by antibody-mediated blocking of integrin function. We show that depletion of MZ B cells around the time of IV prion exposure did not affect the early accumulation of blood-borne prions upon splenic FDC or reduce susceptibility to IV prion infection. In conclusion, our data suggest that the initial delivery of blood-borne prions to FDC in the spleen occurs independently of MZ B cells.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-55772-w;4.8;6.4;7.2;;31836813;19119;;;

This study seeks to describe current prices for originator DAAs in 50 countries and evaluate the relationship between prices and GDP per capita. Methods: Data on prices of sofosbuvir, daclatasvir, sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, and glecaprevir/ pibrentasvir were collected from national databases for 50 countries. Cost-based generic prices were estimated using an established algorithm, which accounts for costs of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), excipients, conversion costs of API to finished pharmaceutical product, taxes assuming manufacture in India, and a 10% profit margin. Correlation between current market prices and GDP per capita was assessed by Spearman rank-order correlation. Results: Median originator prices per standard course were US$40,502 for sofosbuvir, US$26,928 for daclatasvir, US$46,812 for sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, US$34,381 for sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, and US$30,710 for glecaprevir/ pibrentasvir (G/P). The estimated cost-based generic prices for a 12-week course were US$28 for sofosbuvir, US$31 for ledipasvir, US$58 for velpatasvir, US$4 for daclatasvir. For fixed-dose combinations, estimated cost-based prices were US$58 for sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, US$85 for sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, and US$31 for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (API cost data were insufficient to calculate an estimate for G/P). Cumulative originator sales of WHO-recommended DAAs reached US$82 billion by the end of 2019. Across the 50 countries, there was no correlation between GDP per capita and DAA price, nor between estimated viraemic population and DAA price. Sub-analyses within World Bank income groups found a significant negative correlation between price and GDP per capita for all DAAs within the high-income countries group. Conclusions: Prices of DAAs vary widely across countries. The lack of correlation between DAA price and GDP per capita and viraemic population suggests that prices for DAAs are not adjusted based on country income level or potential patient population. Among high-income countries, DAA prices fall as income levels rise, possibly due to greater negotiating power of wealthier countries. DAA prices in most countries remain many times higher than estimated cost-based generic prices.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2055664020300017;0;0;0;;;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2055664020300017;;

OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to compare the single-dose pharmacokinetic properties and safety of DP-R212 (FDC of amlodipine and rosuvastatin) to those of each agent co-administered in healthy Korean subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 36 healthy Korean subjects were enrolled in this randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-treatment, two-way crossover study. During each treatment period, subjects received the test drug (FDC tablet containing amlodipine and rosuvastatin) or reference drugs (individual tablets). Plasma samples were collected pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-dose. Safety was assessed by the evaluation of adverse events (AEs), laboratory assessments, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, and vital sign measurements. RESULTS: The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric least-square mean ratios of AUClast and Cmax were 0.9796 - 1.0590 and 1.0135 - 1.0981 for amlodipine, and 0.9156 - 1.0490 and 0.8400 - 1.0306 for rosuvastatin, respectively. All AEs were of mild to moderate intensity, and no significant difference was observed in the incidence of AEs between the treatments. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic properties of the test and reference drugs were bioequivalent to each other, satisfying the regulatory criteria (0.8 - 1.25). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Both drugs were safe and well tolerated, and the pharmacokinetic profiles were comparable between the treatments.;https://www.dustri.com/article_response_page.html?artId=185833&doi=10.5414/CP203554&L=0;2.0;2.1;2.1;;31549624;;;;

An important issue in generating virtual views is how to fill the holes caused by occlusion. Using the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to generate the background reference image is a commonly used hole-filling method. However, GMM usually has poor performance for sequences with reciprocal motion. In this paper, we propose an improved GMM-based method. To avoid the foreground pixels misclassified as the background pixels, we use depth information to adjust the learning rate in GMM. Foreground pixel is given a smaller learning rate than the background. Further, a refined foreground depth correlation (FDC) algorithm is proposed, which generates the background frame by tracking the change of the foreground depth in the temporal direction. In contrast to existing algorithms, we use a sliding window to obtain multiple background reference frames. These reference frames are then fused together to generate a more accurate background frame. Finally, we adaptively choose the background pixel from the GMM and FDC for hole filling. The experimental results show that subjective gain can be achieved, and significant objective gain can be observed in reciprocal motion sequences.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8965964/;0;0;0;;;8965964;;true;9781728137230

This has suggested the necessity to have a clearer indication on its clinical use, with the support of expert pain clinicians, working in different medical specialities, and reinforced by the data present in the literature. Methods: With the aim of assisting clinicians in the use of DKP/TRAM FDC in daily practice, two rounds of a modified Delphi process were conducted. In the first round, a board of nine experts developed a series of consensus statements based on available evidence, and their clinical experience, with DKP/TRAM FDC. In the second round, 75 clinicians with extensive experience in pain management expressed individually their agreement with the statements, using a dedicated online platform. Consensus was defined as at least 70% agreement. Results: Twenty-eight statements were developed. Of these, 19 reached the defined level of consensus. Conclusion: The agreed consensus statements may assist clinicians in applying the results of clinical studies and clinical experience to routine care settings, providing guidance for use of this new analgesic combination in moderate-to-severe post-operative and non-surgical acute pain.

Molecular modeling allowed us to choose the solvent and antisolvent required for the formation of nanosuspension by estimating the solubility parameter. Molecular dynamics simulations and the analysis of the same provided useful information at the molecular level. Hydrogen bonding interactions, radial distribution functions, the radius of gyration, diffusion coefficient, and density profile analysis allowed us to see the formation of particles virtually. With the information obtained from the simulations, we were able to design our experiments and found that the results from experiments complemented the findings from the simulations. Nanosuspension was prepared by using high-speed homogenization (HSH) followed by probe sonication. The solid-state characterization studies demonstrated that both the drugs remain in the amorphous form with absence of any intermolecular interactions. The pharmacokinetic study indicated a significant improvement in the oral bioavailability of DRV/RTV nanosuspension compared to the pure drug combination. Thus, the studies demonstrated that the developed FDC nanosuspension could be a useful alternative dosage form for treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167732219320446;5.4;6.7;8.1;S0167732219320446;;111469;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0167732219320446;;

Such patients may benefit from concomitant therapy with ezetimibe (EZE) 10 mg added on to a statin. To this end, fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets containing EZE 10 mg and rosuvastatin (ROS) 2.5 mg (EZE/ROS2.5) and EZE 10 mg and ROS 5 mg (EZE/ROS5) have been developed for treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The purpose of the series of clinical studies reported herein was to evaluate the potential food effect (MK-0653H, protocol 836 (P836)) and the bioequivalence between FDC and co-administration of EZE and ROS in healthy Japanese subjects under fasted and fed conditions (MK-0653H, protocol 835 (P835) and MK-0653H, protocol 846 (P846), respectively). These studies show there is no clinically relevant food effect on EZE exposure following single oral administration of the FDC EZE/ROS5 in healthy Japanese subjects; however, ROS exposure was decreased in the fed state under conditions used to evaluate the maximum food effect. Following single oral administration of individual ROS tablets under the same conditions, the magnitude of decrease in ROS exposure was comparable to that seen with FDC, suggesting that the effect of food on ROS exposure was similar between the FDC tablet and co-administration of individual EZE and ROS tablets. The FDC EZE/ROS5 was generally well tolerated in healthy Japanese subjects under fasted and fed conditions.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cts.12677;2.4;4.2;4.9;;31365188;;;;

Based on the levels of HIV-1 DNA in naive (TN) vs resting memory CD4+ T cells, it is widely hypothesized that this reservoir resides primarily within memory cells. Here, we compared virus production from TN and central memory (TCM) CD4+ T cells isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals on suppressive therapy. Methods: CD4+ TN and TCM cells were purified from the blood of 7 HIV-1-infected individuals. We quantified total HIV-1 DNA in the CD4+ TN and TCM cells. Extracellular virion-associated HIV-1 RNA or viral outgrowth assays were used to assess latency reversal following treatment with anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), phytohaemagglutinin/interleukin-2, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin, prostratin, panobinostat, or romidepsin. Results: HIV-1 DNA was significantly higher in TCM compared to TN cells (2179 vs 684 copies/106 cells, respectively). Following exposure to anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs, virion-associated HIV-1 RNA levels were similar between TCM and TN cells (15 135 vs 18 290 copies/mL, respectively). In 4/7 donors, virus production was higher for TN cells independent of the latency reversing agent used. Replication-competent virus was recovered from both TN and TCM cells. Conclusions: Although the frequency of HIV-1 infection is lower in TN compared to TCM cells, as much virus is produced from the TN population after latency reversal. This finding suggests that quantifying HIV-1 DNA alone may not predict the size of the inducible latent reservoir and that TN cells may be an important reservoir of latent HIV-1.;https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/69/11/1919/5308425;14.0;13.8;12.5;;30753360;;;;

Method: The phase behavior of saquinavir alone and in the presence of ritonavir was studied by pH shift supersaturation assay. The generation of drug-rich phase was confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV extinction method. The nature of precipitate generated after pH shift was investigated by employing DSC and XRPD. Further, the flux studies were performed by employing dialysis membrane using Franz diffusion cell. Results: Saquinavir precipitated in the amorphous form exhibiting type-II precipitation behavior generating the drug-rich phase and undergoing glass-liquid phase separation (GLPS) after the shift in pH towards higher side. The supersaturation advantage of saquinavir was marginally lowered in the presence of amorphous ritonavir. However, the free drug concentration of ritonavir was significantly reduced below the saturation solubility generating a subsaturated state. Both the drugs exhibited lowering in the chemical potential in the presence of each other, thereby reducing their flux/diffusion. The decrease in the free drug concentration and chemical potential were found dependent on the mole fraction of the solute present in the binary supersaturated solution. Conclusion: The findings of the phase behavior of weak bases in the presence of other solutes are of great value not only in fixed-dose combination and concomitantly administered drugs but also in formulating supersaturated systems like amorphous solid dispersions and co-amorphous systems.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12247-018-9357-6;3.7;3.4;2.5;;;;;;

Methods: Using data collected in a multicenter clinical trial in Thailand and proportional hazard regression models, we compared the risk of a >25% estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reduction in HIV naïve patients initiating TDF or zidovudine (AZT) containing non-PI regimen. Results: Of 640 patients included in the analysis, 461 (72%) received a TDF-containing regimen for a median 6.7 years and 179 (28%) an AZT-containing regimen for 6.5 years. The risk of a >25% eGFR reduction was not associated with treatment (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84–1.47, P = 0.46).

The Authors.Background: Antiretrovirals, particularly efavirenz (EFV), have been shown to cause breast abnormalities in adults. Little is known about the prevalence of these adverse effects among adolescents receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Objectives: The aim of this article was to examine the extent of breast abnormalities in adolescents receiving ART and determine any clinical associations. Methods: A retrospective record review describing breast conditions in adolescents receiving ART at three facilities in Johannesburg was conducted. Patients aged 10-19 years, who presented from January to December 2014, were included in the study. Analyses were conducted to determine whether EFV was associated with increased breast conditions. Results: Of the 631 patient records reviewed, 37 (6%) had an abnormal breast event documented; with 24/37 (65%) being male patients. Patients with abnormal breast conditions were 1.5 years older than patients with normal breast development (p < 0.0005). Forty-one abnormal breast events were observed in 37 patients, with 20 described as gynaecomastia or lipomastia (49%). Of the 37 patients, 44% (n = 19) had concurrent generalised lipodystrophy. Of those with an abnormal breast event, 71% of patients had CD4 counts > 500 cells/L and were virologically suppressed (n = 29). Those on EFV had a significantly higher prevalence of breast abnormalities compared to other regimens ( p = 0.016). Conclusion: Of the studied patients, 6% had an abnormal breast condition. The use of EFV and increased age were associated with breast abnormalities in this population. Further research is needed to better understand the implications of this potential side effect.";https://sajhivmed.org.za/index.php/hivmed/article/view/1017;1.6;1.2;1.3;;;;;;

A critical contributor to this success has been the development of better tolerated, safer, and more convenient antiretroviral medication regimens. Today, 12 fixed-dose, single-tablet combination antiretroviral regimens are available in the United States. These regimens are commonly used in nonpregnant individuals. However, because of altered pharmacokinetics of many drugs during pregnancy and concerns regarding short- and long-term fetal safety, few of these regimens are appropriate for routine use in pregnancy.;http://journals.lww.com/00003081-201912000-00020;2.4;2.5;2.6;;31305487;;;;

In the frame of a considerable burden of HIV/HBV co-infection (17.5%), monitoring HBV among children living with HIV (CLHIV) would guide toward HIV/HBV integrated paediatric care. We sought to ascertain the prevalence and determinants of HBV infection in the population of CLHIV and performance of commonly used rapid diagnosis tests (RDTs). Methods: Cross-sectional study conducted from February through June 2017 in a subset of CLHIV 15 years old at the Essos Hospital Centre, Yaounde, Cameroon. HBV was tested by HBsAg ELISA sandwich in duplicates for each sample, and the mean optical density was calculated. The Determinants of HBV-prevalencewere evaluated, and p < 0.05 was the significance threshold. The performance of two HBV RDTs (Diaspot vs. HBV-5) was evaluated in comparison to ELISA (used as gold standard). Results: Of the 83 CLHIV enrolled (54.2% female, mean age 8.7 [±3.8] years, 60% vaccinated against HBV, all breastfed), HBV-prevalence was 2.41% (2/83). HBV-positivity was significantly associated with unknown maternal HBV status (2.9% [2/69] vs. 0.0% [0/14], p = 0.0097) and vaginal delivery (2.4% [2/82] vs. 0.0% [0/1], p = 0.0018). Moreover, the most likely to be positive were aged 11 and 15 years, and had experienced neither anti-HBV vaccination nor anti-HBV serum administration, and both had not been treated with any antiseptic solution at birth. Regarding the performance of Diaspot vs. HBV-5 respectively, sensitivity was 100% (2/2) vs. 50% (1/2), while specificity was 100% (45/45) vs. 97.8% (44/45); positive and negative predictive values of Diaspot versus HBV-5 were respectively 100% (2/2) and 100% (45/45) versus 50% (1/2) and 97.8% (44/45). Conclusion: HBV-infection in the population of CLHIV appears at a moderate prevalence, suggesting a decreased burden likely due to preventive measures including the wide vaccine coverage. Focusing on mothers with unknown HBV status and promoting safer delivery mode (caesarean section) for HBV-positive motherswould contribute toward pediatric HBV elimination. In context of limited resources, Diaspot test appears more reliable to rollout HBV-infection in the population of CLHIV. As findings are limited to a small sample size, studies on a wider population would be relevant.";https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-019-1750-x;4.1;3.1;2.5;;31640616;366;;;

She was reportedly newly diagnosed with HIV and had been initiated on antiretroviral treatment and tuberculosis (TB) prophylaxis. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed an irregular, ulcerative oesophageal lesion. Subsequent histopathology revealed M ycobacterium tuberculosis as well as C andida albicans. A CT scan demonstrated widespread disease with miliary TB. She was subsequently initiated on antituberculous and antifungal medications. TB is one of the most common and deadly infectious diseases in the world, with the highest rates seen in the developing countries. It commonly occurs as an opportunistic infection of HIV. Despite its potential for systemic infection, infection of the oesophagus is incredibly rare, more so as a co-infection with candida. This case highlights the need to have a high index of suspicion in high risk groups, as early treatment is crucial in addressing this global health crisis.;https://casereports.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bcr-2019-231435;0.6;0.6;0.6;;31678924;e231435;;;

Pharmacologic treatment options of COPD are bronchodilators, using either long-acting 2-agonists (LABAs), or long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), or a combination of two. Anoro Ellipta (umeclidinium + vilanterol) dry powder inhaler, a fixed-dose combination of LAMA and LABA, was Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in 2013 for COPD. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once daily umeclidinium/vilanterol (62.5 mcg/25 mcg) in COPD patients, focusing on pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics, efficacy and safety in clinical studies and cost. Literature search was done through PubMed (2004-2017) using the terms umeclidinium, vilanterol, COPD, LABA and LAMA. Recent and significant clinical trials about the monocomponents and their combination were identified, in addition to reviews, guidelines for COPD, data from manufacturer and FDA product labels. The search was limited to English language studies on human subjects. Clinical data published on the combination of umeclidinium/vilanterol in patients with COPD have shown greater improvements in lung function compared to monotherapies. However, further studies comparing umeclidinium/vilanterol FDC (ANORO) to other LABA/LAMA combinations are needed.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/crj.13073;2.9;2.4;3.0;;31389190;;;;

The method involves only addition of acetonitrile to precipitation of plasma proteins followed by solvent evaporation. The mobile phase consisted of methanol, acetonitrile and 0.1 M formic acid (20:50:30) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min with run time of 5 min. A CSH C18 column and a UHPLC-UV system operating at 245 nm were used. There was a linear response in the range of 0.078 to 10 g/mL, and the equation was obtained by weighting (1/x2) with r2 = 0.9965. The pharmacokinetic disposition of EFV was investigated in rabbits (two groups, n = 7) following a single intravenous administration (IV group) at a dose of 2.7 mg/kg and a single oral administration (oral group) of EFV co-administered with lamivudine (3TC) and tenofovir (TNF) at a dose of 50, 25 and 25 mg, respectively. The study demonstrated the applicability of the method for determination of EFV in plasma without interference from other co-administered drugs, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. The method showed advantages over other methods in the literature, such as simplicity of sample processing and fast results.;https://academic.oup.com/chromsci/article/57/10/874/5584834;2.1;2.5;2.6;;31602469;;;;

Diagnosis is with indirect fundoscopy, and treatment is with intravitreal ganciclovir injections or systemic therapy. However, diagnosis and treatment are not widely available in Malawi, which has an adult HIV prevalence estimated at 10.6%. This study aimed to establish the prevalence of cytomegalovirus retinitis among people with HIV in Malawi and the feasibility of screening. Methods: Patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3 were examined from 2 HIV clinics in Lilongwe and the main government hospital. Data were collected on antiretroviral therapy, ocular symptoms, and visual acuity. Fundoscopy was performed to investigate for features of cytomegalovirus retinitis. Retinal photographs were reviewed by an ophthalmologist. Patients diagnosed with cytomegalovirus retinitis were offered weekly ganciclovir injections, because systemic treatment was not available. Results: Five of the 102 people with HIV screened had cytomegalovirus retinitis (4.9%). All affected patients had CD4 counts <50 cells/mm3 (mean, 15 cells/mm3; range, 3-22 cells/mm3). Visual acuity was unhelpful in identifying those with cytomegalovirus retinitis. Symptomatically, only blurred vision was useful. Two patients consented to treatment, 1 of which improved but relapsed after defaulting. Conclusions: Cytomegalovirus retinitis screening based on CD4 count is essential to early recognition because visual acuity and symptoms are unreliable. Cytomegalovirus retinitis is a significant yet neglected public health issue in Malawi. Oral valganciclovir is essential to reduce blindness and mortality in those diagnosed but is not yet available. Further screening and advocacy are needed.";https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofz439/5613994;3.5;4.6;3.8;;;ofz439;;;

Among 10 million patients that fell ill with tuberculosis in the year 2017, 36 % were undiagnosed or detected and not reported; the number goes as high as 55 % in Tanzania, showing that the diagnosis of TB is a big challenge in the developing countries. There have been great advancements in TB diagnostics with introduction of the molecular tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, lipoarabinomannan urine strip test, and molecular line-probe assays. However, most of the hospitals in Tanzania still rely on the TB score chart in children, the WHO screening questions in adults, acid-fast bacilli and chest x-ray for the diagnosis of TB. Xpert MTB/RIF has been rolled-out but remains a challenge in settings where the samples for testing must be transported over many kilometers. Imaging by sonography - nowadays widely available even in rural settings of Tanzania - has been shown to be a useful tool in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Despite all the efforts and new diagnostics, 30-50 % of patients in high-burden TB countries are still empirically treated for tuberculosis.

Methods: Adults with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension (unmedicated intraocular pressure [IOP] >20 and <36 mm Hg at 8:00 AM) were randomized to receive once-daily netarsudil/latanoprost FDC, netarsudil 0.02%, or latanoprost 0.005% for up to 12 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was mean IOP at 8:00 AM, 10:00 AM, and 4:00 PM at week 2, week 6, and month 3. Results: Mean treated IOP ranged from 14.8–16.2 mm Hg for netarsudil/latanoprost FDC, 17.2–19.0 mm Hg for netarsudil, and 16.7–17.8 mm Hg for latanoprost.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Chlorophyll is the dominant pigment in the photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes that is related to the physiological function of leaves and is responsible for light absorption and energy transfer. Dust pollution has become an environmental problem in many areas in China, indicating that accurately estimating chlorophyll content of vegetation using remote sensing for assessing the vegetation growth status in dusty areas is vital. However, dust deposited on the leaf may affect the chlorophyll content retrieval accuracy. Thus, quantitatively studying the dustfall effect is essential. Using selected vegetation indices (VIs), the medium resolution imaging spectrometer terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI), and the double difference index (DD), we studied the retrieval accuracy of chlorophyll content at the leaf scale under dusty environments based on a laboratory experiment and spectra simulation. First, the retrieval accuracy under different dustfall amounts was studied based on a laboratory experiment. Then, the relationship between dustfall amount and fractional dustfall cover (FDC) was experimentally analyzed for spectra simulation of dusty leaves. Based on spectral data simulated using a PROSPECT-based mixture model, the sensitivity of VIs to dust under different chlorophyll contents was analyzed comprehensively, and the MTCI was modified to reduce its sensitivity to dust. The results showed that (1) according to experimental investigation, the DD model provides low retrieval accuracy, the MTCI model is highly accurate when the dustfall amount is less than 80 g/m2, and the retrieval accuracy decreases significantly when the dustfall amount is more than 80 g/m2; (2) a logarithmic relationship exists between FDC and dustfall amount, and the PROSPECT-based mixture model can simulate the leaf spectra under different dustfall amounts and different chlorophyll contents with a root mean square error of 0.015; and (3) according to numerical investigation, MTCI’s sensitivity to dust in the chlorophyll content range of 25 to 60 µg/cm2 is lower than in other chlorophyll content ranges; DD’s sensitivity to dust was generally high throughout the whole chlorophyll content range. These findings may contribute to quantitatively understanding the dustfall effect on the retrieval of chlorophyll content and would help to accurately retrieve chlorophyll content in dusty areas using remote sensing.";https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/24/5530;4.3;4.3;5.0;;31847376;5530;;;

The HF study ensures safe and effective use of the device by intended users, for intended uses, under intended use environments. Areas covered: This review compiles information of HF studies conducted for biological combination products (biological products plus device) approved by US FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research between 21 June 2011 and 31 December 2018. Information regarding product, indication, device type, administration frequency, and various aspects related to HF studies was collected from published documents. Expert opinion: Learnings from HF studies and known use-related problems of similar devices should be incorporated in the design of the device and the HF validation study. User profile, group, subgroup, and sample size are important aspects of the HF validation study. Early engagement with US FDA can be helpful to integrate the HF program with the overall device development program. It may not be possible to eliminate all use errors or risks for the device. Any residual risk after an HF validation study should be evaluated, and benefits of the device use should outweigh the residual risk.

The present analysis evaluated cost-effectiveness of CAZ-AVI as an empirical treatment for hospitalized patients with cUTIs from the Italian publicly funded healthcare (third-party payer) perspective. A sequential, patient-level simulation model was developed that followed the clinical course of cUTI and generated 5000 pairs of identical patients (CAZ-AVI or imipenem as empirical treatment). The model included additional impact of resistant pathogens; patients who did not respond to empirical treatment were switched to second-line treatment of colistin+high dose carbapenem in both groups. The time horizon of the model was five years, with an annual discount rate of 3% applied to both costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The analysis demonstrated that an intervention sequence (CAZ-AVI followed by colistin+high dose carbapenem) compared with a comparator sequence (imipenem followed by colistin+high dose carbapenem) was associated with a net incremental cost of €1015 per patient but provided better health outcomes in terms of clinical cure (97.65% vs. 91.08%;  = 6.57%), shorter hospital stays (10.65 vs. 12.55 days;  = 1.90 days), and QALYs gained per patient (4.190 vs. 4.063;  = 0.126). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €8039/QALY, which is well below the willingness-to-pay threshold of €30 000/QALY in Italy. The results showed that CAZ-AVI is expected to be a cost-effective treatment compared with imipenem for cUTI in Italy.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S092485791930161X;6.5;6.6;6.7;S092485791930161X;31202921;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S092485791930161X;;

Furthermore, we investigated alternative dosing schedules. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, patients with advanced NSCLC receiving first- or second-line pemetrexed(/platinum) were enrolled. Plasma sampling was performed weekly (cyclePK) and within 24 h (24hPK) after pemetrexed administration. With population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling, total exposure to pemetrexed during cycle 1 (area under the curve during chemotherapy cycle 1 [AUC1]) was estimated and related to progression-free survival (PFS)/overall survival (OS). We compared mean AUC1 (mg·h/L) in patients with and without severe chemotherapy-related adverse events (AEs) during total treatment. Second, different dosing schedules were simulated to minimise the estimated variability (coefficient of variation [CV]) of AUC. Results: For 106 of 165 patients, concentrations of pemetrexed were quantified (24hPK, n = 15; cyclePK, n = 106). After adjusting for prognostic factors, sex, disease stage and World Health Organisation performance score, AUC1 did not predict PFS/OS in treatment-naive patients (n = 95) (OS, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00–1.11; PFS, HR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.98–1.08). Patients with severe chemotherapy-related AEs (n = 55) had significantly higher AUC1 values than patients without them (n = 51) (226 ± 53 vs 190 ± 31, p < 0.001). Compared with body surface area–based dosing (CV: 22.5%), simulation of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)–based dosing (CV 18.5%) and fixed dose of 900 mg with 25% dose reduction, if the eGFR<60 mL/min (CV: 19.1%), resulted in less interindividual variability of AUC. Conclusions: Higher exposure to pemetrexed does not increase PFS/OS but is significantly associated with increased occurrence of severe toxicity. Our findings suggest that fixed dosing reduces interpatient pharmacokinetic variability and thereby might prevent toxicity, while preserving effectiveness.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959804919304721;10.6;11.4;12.6;S0959804919304721;31561135;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0959804919304721;;

The present study was conducted to evaluate health status of COPD patients, initiated on IND/GLY 110/50 g o.d., using the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) tool in a real-world primary care setting in Ireland. Methods: This was a real-world, prospective, open-label study. COPD patients aged > 40 years and with a smoking history of > 10 pack-years were included and switched to once-daily IND/GLY 110/50 g. Enrolment of patients into the study occurred only after the decision had been made by the physician to prescribe IND/GLY 110/50 g. Data were collected at baseline and Week 26. Health status was assessed using the validated CCQ. Results: A total of 200 patients were included in study.

Methods: We estimated the incidence rate and risk factors of tuberculosis disease in adult PLHIV initiating first- and second-line anti-retroviral therapy (ART) prior to widespread IPT in a public ART center in Pune, India. Results: 4067 participants contributing 5205.7 person-years of follow-up on first-line ART and 871 participants contributing 1031.7 person-years of follow-up on second-line ART were included in the analysis. The incidence rate of tuberculosis was 4.39 cases (95%CI 3.86-5.00) per 100 person-years on first-line ART and 1.64 cases (95%CI 1.01-2.63) per 100 person-years on second-line ART (p < 0.001). After adjusting for competing risks, male sex (aSHR = 1.33, 95%CI 1.02-1.74, p = 0.03), urban residence (aSHR = 1.53, 95%CI 1.13-2.07, p = 0.006) and CD4+ counts < 350 cells/mm3 (aSHR = 3.06 vs CD4 > 350 cells/mm3, 95%CI 1.58-5.94, p < 0.001) at ART initiation were associated with higher risk of tuberculosis independent of ART regimen. Conclusion: Risk of tuberculosis was lower in PLHIV receiving second-line ART compared to first-line ART. Prioritizing IPT in PLHIV with low CD4+ counts, urban residence and in males may further mitigate the risk of tuberculosis during ART.;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-019-4569-z;4.5;4.3;4.1;;31664933;914;;;

Methods: Eleven adult Czech HIV+ patients, with a mean age of 35 years and CD4 cell count  230 × 106 cells/L of blood at the time of enrollment, underwent four to six examinations over the course of 2.5 years to evaluate pattern-reversal and motion-onset visual evoked potentials (P-VEPs and M-VEPs), visually driven oddball event-related potentials (ERPs) and Montreal Cognitive Assessments. In addition to evaluating the intraindividual change in the observed parameters, we also compared patient data to data from eleven age- and gender-matched controls. Results: We did not find any significant differences in P-VEPs between the patients and controls or in the paired comparison of the first and last visit. The only significant finding for P-VEPs was a linear trend in prolongation of the 20 P-VEP P100 peak time. In M-VEPs, we found a significant intergroup difference in the N160 peak time recorded during the first visit for peripheral M-VEPs only. During the last visit, all N160 peak times for patients differed significantly from those of the control group. The only intervisit difference close to the level of significance was for peripheral M-VEPs, which confirmed the trend analysis. No significant differences between patients and controls were found in the ERPs, but the P300 peak time showed a significant difference between the first and last visits, as confirmed by the trend. Patient reaction time was not significantly delayed at the first visit; however, it was prolonged with time, as confirmed by the trend. Conclusion: Our aim was to evaluate whether antiretroviral treatment in HIV+ patients is sufficient to preserve brain visual function. The optic nerve and primary visual cortex function tested by the P-VEPs seem to be preserved. The prolongation of the M-VEPs suggests an individually detectable decline in CNS function, but these changes did not show a progression during the follow-up. From a longitudinal perspective, the trends in peak time prolongation of the 20 P-VEP, peripheral M-VEP, ERP and reaction time suggest a faster decline than that caused by aging in healthy populations, as previously described in a cross-sectional study.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10633-019-09697-4;3.5;4.3;2.7;;30993574;;;;

Due to its unique architecture of 24 self-assembling subunits and hollow cavity capable of encapsulating drugs, and an outer surface that can be modified genetically and chemically for additional functionality, ferritin has recently emerged as a promising drug delivery vehicle. Recent research demonstrated that unmodified human heavy chain ferritin binds to its receptor, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), in different types of tumor tissues, including lung and breast cancer, thus highlighting the potential use of ferritin for tumor-targeting applications. In this review, we consider the many favorable characteristics of ferritin drug carriers (FDCs) for tumor drug delivery. In particular, compared with antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), ferritin exhibits superiority in a range of attributes, including drug loading ability, thermostability, and ease of production. Thus, the emergence of FDCs may be the next step in targeted cancer therapy.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168365919305358;14.0;13.8;14.4;S0168365919305358;31494184;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0168365919305358;;

Fixed-dose co-formulation, rather than free combinations, simplifies medication taking and also improves adherence to medication, which is the key for a successful management of these conditions. Aim: To determine the number of patients potentially eligible for treatment with triple fixed-dose atorvastatin/perindopril/amlodipine (CTAPA), and to estimate if an unmet medical need exists among CTAPA free combination treated patients. Methods: This observational retrospective study was based on administrative databases of 3 Italian Local Health Units. The cohort comprised adult patients with at least one prescription of amlodipine and perindopril (either as free combination or co-formulated) and atorvastatin during 2014. Follow-up period started on the date of prescription of the 3 molecules (index date) and lasted 1 year. Adherence to CTAPA was analyzed during follow-up, by using the proportion of days covered (PDC). Results: 2292 patients (9.1 per 10,000 beneficiaries) had a prescription for CTAPA as free combination. Only 1249 (54.5%) were adherent to the therapy (PDC  80%); among them, a small percentage required dosage modification. The number of patients with CTAPA increased during the study period. Discontinuation of drugs prescribed the year before interested 582 patients in 2014, and 522 in 2015. Considering the Italian national population (n = 60,782,668), it was estimated that 69,542 hypertensive patients could be eligible for fixed-dose CTAPA during 2014. Conclusions: Real-world analysis among patients with free combination therapy can be applied to estimate the eligible population for fixed combination, and to evaluate the appropriateness of their prescriptions. Moreover, fixed-dose CTAPA could effectively improve adherence, which was calculated to be low in the free combination cohort.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40292-019-00336-2;2.1;2.4;2.9;;31463886;;;;

We prospectively compared MDR-TB/HIV-coinfected persons to those with MDR-TB alone to determine the impact of concurrent treatment on adherence and outcomes. Methods: We assessed medication adherence monthly using 3-day recall, 30-day recall, and visual analog scale and examined adherence to monthly study visits (months 0-12). We determined the proportion of participants fully adherent (no reported missed doses) to MDR-TB vs. HIV treatment by each measure. We assessed the association of medication and clinic visit adherence with MDR-TB treatment success (cure or completion, 18-24 months) and HIV virologic suppression. Results: Among 200 patients with MDR-TB, 63% were women, median age was 33 years, 144 (72%) were HIV-infected, and 81% were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) at baseline. Adherence to medications (81%-98% fully adherent across all measures) and clinic visits (80% missed 1 visit) was high, irrespective of HIV status. Adherence to ART was significantly higher than to MDR-TB treatment by all self-reported measures (3-day recall: 92% vs. 84%, respectively; P = 0.003). In multivariable analysis, the adjusted risk ratio of unsuccessful MDR-TB treatment increased with every missed visit: 1.50, 2.25, and 3.37 for unsuccessful treatment, for 1, 2, and 3 missed visits. Conclusions: Adherence to ART was higher than to MDR-TB treatment among persons with MDR-TB/HIV coinfection.

We evaluated HIV drug resistance in PWID in a randomized clinical trial (HPTN 074). The study intervention included ART at any CD4 cell count with enhanced support for ART and substance use treatment. Methods HPTN 074 enrolled HIV-infected PWID (index participants) with viral loads .1,000 copies/ mL and their HIV-uninfected injection-network partners in Indonesia, Ukraine, and Vietnam; the study limited enrollment of people who reported being on ART. HIV drug resistance testing and antiretroviral (ARV) drug testing were performed using samples collected from index participants at study enrollment. Results Fifty-four (12.0%) of 449 participants had HIV drug resistance; 29 (53.7%) of the 54 participants had multi-class resistance. Prevalence of resistance varied by study site and was associated with self-report of prior or current ART, detection of ARV drugs, and a history of incarceration. Resistance was detected in 10 (5.6%) of 177 newly diagnosed participants. Participants with resistance at enrollment were less likely to be virally suppressed after 52 weeks of follow-up, independent of study arm. Conclusions In HPTN 074, many of the enrolled index participants had HIV drug resistance and more than half of those had multi-class resistance. Some newly-diagnosed participants had resistance, suggesting that they may have been infected with drug-resistant HIV strains. Behavioral and geographic factors were associated with baseline resistance. Baseline resistance was associated with reduced viral suppression during study follow-up. These findings indicate the need for enhanced HIV care in this high-risk population to achieve sustained viral suppression on ART.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0223829;5.7;5.4;5.2;;31600343;e0223829;;;

Using routinely collected data, we conducted a retrospective study to describe the prevalence of CVD risk factors among a cohort of HIV-infected patients followed for over 10 years in Port-au Prince, Haiti. This cohort includes 910 adults who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) between 2003 and 2004 and remained in care between 2014 and 2016 when routine screening for CVD risk factors was implemented at a large clinic in Haiti. A total of 397 remained in care 10 years and received screening. At ART initiation, 59% were female, median age was 38 years (IQR 33-44), and median CD4 count was 117 cells/mm3 (IQR 34-201). Median follow-up time from ART initiation was 12.1 years (IQR 11.7-12.7). At screening, median CD4 count was 574 cells/mm3 (IQR 378-771), and 84% (282 of 336 screened) had HIV-1 RNA < 1000 copies/mL. Seventy-four percent of patients had at least 1 risk factor including 58% (224/385) with hypertension, 8% (24/297) diabetes, 43% (119/275) hypercholesterolemia, 8% (20/248) active smoking, and 10% (25/245) obesity. Factors associated with hypertension were age (adjusted OR 1.06, P <.001) and weight at screening (adjusted OR 1.02, P =.019). Long-term AIDS survivors have a high prevalence of CVD risk factors, primarily hypertension. Integration of cardiovascular screening and management into routine HIV care is needed to maximize health outcomes among aging HIV patients in resource-limited settings.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jch.13663;4.3;3.8;4.0;;31448551;;;;

Family day care (FDC) offers a setting where good eating habits can be nurtured in young children, yet often the food environment is unhealthy. This study aims to determine FDC educators’ knowledge and confidence about nutrition and the barriers and enablers to supporting healthy food environments. Australian FDC educators were recruited to a mixed methods study using self-administered esurveys and qualitative in-depth interviews. The survey data (n = 188) revealed good knowledge about sugary foods, but poor knowledge of protein-rich foods. Nutrition knowledge was not associated with confidence to make nutrition recommendations. Interviews (n = 9) revealed parents’ dietary choices and educators’ personal beliefs as barriers to healthy food environments, although importantly, the FDC educator role was identified as being pivotal in supporting the health and wellbeing of children and their families. This study highlights that FDC-specific nutrition education and support is vital to ensure children at FDC and their families are exposed to healthy food environments. Research to investigate specific avenues for nutrition education promotion programs specifically designed to support the unique role played by FDC educators is needed, in order to support the long-term health and welfare of the next generation of Australians.;https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/10/2395;4.8;5.0;5.2;;31591359;2395;;;

The present study aimed to understand the plasma metabolomic changes and predicted the risk of accelerated aging in PLHIV on long-term suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a case-control study setting and its association with the plasma proteomics biomarkers of inflammation and neurological defects. Plasma samples were obtained from PLHIV on successful long-term ART for more than five years (n = 22) and matched HIV-negative healthy individuals (n = 22, HC herein). Untargeted metabolite profiling was carried out using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS/MS). Plasma proteomics profiling was performed using proximity extension assay targeting 184 plasma proteins. A total of 250 metabolites differed significantly (p < 0.05, q < 0.1) between PLHIV and HC. Plasma levels of several essential amino acids except for histidine, branched-chain amino acids, and aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan) were significantly lower in PLHIV compared to HC. Machine-learning prediction of metabolite changes indicated a higher risk of inflammatory and neurological diseases in PLHIV. Metabolic abnormalities were observed in amino-acid levels, energetics, and phospholipids and complex lipids, which may reflect known differences in lipoprotein levels in PLHIV that can resemble metabolic syndrome (MetS).;https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/9/10/210;4.2;4.8;3.1;;;210;;;

FDCs have advantages in the management of hypertension compared to single drug tablets including improved adherence, greater blood pressure lowering and are associated with reduced cardiovascular complications. FDCs can also reduce ethnic, and age-related variation in blood pressure lowering and have similar or reduced adverse effects relative to single-drug therapy. Best hypertension control practices from the World Health Organization HEARTS program advocates the use of FDC in simple directive treatment protocols. FDC in simple directive protocols was viewed as a key success factor in the control of chronic infections (eg, tuberculosis, HIV). Unfortunately, implementing simple directive protocols with FDC has had substantial opposition from hypertension experts. Hypertension organizations and experts need to familiarize themselves with best practices in hypertension control, their supporting evidence and to become advocates.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jch.13683;4.3;3.8;4.0;;31441988;;;;

Although renal proximal tubular dysfunction and phosphaturia is common with TDF, it is unknown whether BMD loss results from inadequate mineralization. We evaluated change in BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bone histomorphometry by tetracycline double-labeled transiliac crest biopsies in young men living with HIV before (n = 20) and 12 months after (n = 16) initiating TDF/lamivudine/efavirenz. We examined relationships between calciotropic hormones, urinary phosphate excretion, pro-inflammatory and pro-resorptive cytokines, and bone remodeling-related proteins with changes in BMD and histomorphometry. Mean age was 29.6 ± 5.5 years, with mean CD4 + T cell count of 473 ± 196 cells/mm3. At baseline, decreased bone formation rate and increased mineralization lag time were identified in 16 (80%) and 12 (60%) patients, respectively. After 12 months, we detected a 2% to 3% decrease in lumbar spine and hip BMD by DXA. By histomorphometry, we observed no change in bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) and trabecular parameters, but rather, increases in cortical thickness, osteoid volume, and osteoblast and osteoclast surfaces. We did not observe significant worsening of renal phosphate excretion or mineralization parameters. Increases in PTH correlated with decreased BMD but not histomorphometric parameters. Overall, these data suggest abnormalities in bone formation and mineralization occur with HIV infection and are evident at early stages. With TDF-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART), there is an increase in bone remodeling, reflected by increased osteoblast and osteoclast surfaces, but a persistence in mineralization defect, resulting in increased osteoid volume. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jbmr.3751;12.0;10.7;10.2;;31269294;;;;

Our objectives are to characterize the effects of rifampicin- and isoniazid-containing anti-TB therapy and CYP2B6 activity on efavirenz concentrations in children, using non-linear mixed-effects modelling. Methods: This is a pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy of a prospective study that examined the interactions between anti-TB therapy and efavirenz in HIV-infected children with and without TB. PK samples were obtained 4 weeks after starting efavirenz (PK1) and repeated 4 weeks after completing TB therapy (PK2) in TB/HIV coinfected patients. Drug concentrations were measured using LC-MS/MS. Composite CYP2B6 516/983/15582 genotype was determined. Population PK modelling was performed in Monolix. Simulations were performed to obtain the predicted mid-dose concentrations (C12). Results: One hundred and five HIV-infected Ghanaian children (46 with TB/HIV) were included. The median age and weight were 7 years and 19 kg. The efavirenz concentrations over time were adequately described using a one-compartment model. Weight, composite CYP2B6 genotype and PK visit had a significant influence on the PK parameters, while TB therapy had no significant effect. Simulations showed adequate C12 for intermediate composite CYP2B6 metabolizers only. Conclusions: Our model showed that rifampicin- and isoniazid-containing anti-TB therapy does not influence efavirenz PK parameters. On the other hand, it describes the effect of efavirenz autoinduction after completing TB treatment. In addition, dosing efavirenz in children based only on weight results in a large variability in drug exposure. We propose dose adjustments for slow and extensive composite CYP2B6 metabolizers.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/74/9/2698/5523702;8.7;7.7;8.3;;31243456;;;;

HIV Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British HIV AssociationObjectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of dual therapy with lamivudine (3TC), with dose adjustment for renal function, and dolutegravir (DTG) in a subgroup of patients fully suppressed on treatment who were switched because of concerns about comorbidity and toxicity on their current triple drug regimen. Methods: A retrospective evaluation of clinical and pathological parameters from an electronic patient record from a single centre was carried out. Results: There were no virological failures in 52 patients with a median age of 60.5 years. The median duration of follow-on dual therapy was 2.29 years (28 months; range 1.10–3.34 years). In 25 of 52 (48%) cases, the dose of 3TC was adjusted taking into account reduced renal function, and none of these patients experienced virological failure. Four additional patients discontinued early, because of side effects of the switch, with no failure. Conclusions: This retrospective review suggests that 3TC and DTG may be effective in controlling viral load in older patients with comorbidities. This regimen appears to be a useful option in the context of comorbidities (including renal impairment) and polypharmacy in older patients. However, this review has been conducted in one centre and in a small population of patients. Therefore, further multicentre trials involving larger populations of patients are needed.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hiv.12781;5.6;5.3;5.8;;31338933;;;;

The combined conditioning of PFS and CTS improved the settleability of the digested sludge more effectively than when using of PFS alone. The SRF value of the digested sludge decreased to 2.08 × 1012 m/kg after conditioning with 50 mg/g PFS and 10 mg/g CTS. Furthermore, a minimum moisture content of 68% was obtained when 40 mg/g PFS and 10 mg/g CTS were used to condition the digested sludge. At a fixed dose of PFS, the concentrations of extracellular polymeric substances, including polysaccharides (C/C0 = 2.1), proteins (C/C0 = 2.7), and deoxyribonucleic acids (C/C0 = 7.8) in the supernatant were increased considerably with an increase in CTS dose (0–10 mg/g). Phosphorus could be recovered efficiently as a result of charge neutralization and the adsorption-bridging effects of CTS, which promote the release of phosphorus from the digested activated sludge. The concentrations of heavy metals in the digested sludge conditioned with 40 mg/g PFS and 10 mg/g CTS satisfied the agricultural safety requirements. These results indicate that conditioning the digested sludge with combinations of PFS and CTS improves its dewatering performance and enables its direct use as a fertilizer.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09593330.2018.1449898;3.1;3.2;3.4;;29513143;;;;

Our primary objective was to quantify exposure of three common antiretrovirals in brain tissue and compare exposures to plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We also sought to identify pockets of brain most vulnerable to inadequate drug exposures and examine the role of meningitis in drug penetration into the CNS. Tenofovir, lamivudine, and efavirenz concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry in plasma and CSF from 14 individuals with HIV, 7 with cryptococcal meningitis. In four individuals (three with meningitis) drug concentrations were also measured in 13 distinct brain tissue regions. In subjects with meningitis, geometric mean ratio (95% confidence interval) of tenofovir CSF to plasma was 66% (7–598%) and 14% (6–31%) in subjects without meningitis. Lamivudine CSF penetration was 100% (25–409%) in subjects with meningitis and 30% (24–37%) in subjects without meningitis. Tenofovir brain tissue concentrations were 36% (14–124%) of plasma and 49% (1–572%) of CSF. Lamivudine brain concentrations were 37% (23–64%) of plasma and 27% (1–104%) of CSF. Efavirenz brain tissue concentrations were 128% (108–179%) of plasma. Tissues collected postmortem provide a unique opportunity to assess drug distribution in tissues difficult to sample in living subjects. CSF is a poor surrogate for drug exposure throughout the CNS.

Netarsudil 0.02% is a new medication that was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2017 for reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Areas covered: We reviewed recent literature on the efficacy and safety of netarsudil both alone and in combination. We included recently published manuscripts from both human and animal studies. Expert opinion: Netarsudil functions by inhibiting rho-associated protein kinases, making it the first IOP lowering medication to directly target the trabecular meshwork. Although the efficacy of the medication in lowering intraocular pressure has been substantiated in numerous studies, the ocular hypotensive effect of netarsudil is in the range of timolol, and less than latanoprost in most studies. The safety profile of netarsudil differs from other currently approved topical ocular hypotensive agents, and at least half of the patients using it are expected to have adverse events–although they may be mild and transient. A fixed-dose combination of netarsudil with latanoprost was approved in March 2019, which has greater ocular hypotensive efficacy than either netarsudil or latanoprost alone.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17469899.2019.1645008;0.9;0.9;1.1;;;;;;

All rights reserved.Objective:Compare the efficacy and safety of the 2-drug antiretroviral therapy regimen dolutegravir + lamivudine (DTG + 3TC) with traditional 3-drug regimens in treatment-naive patients with HIV-1.Design:Data from double-blind, randomized controlled trials of at least 48 weeks' duration in treatment-naive patients with HIV-1 identified by systematic review were evaluated using a Bayesian network meta-analysis methodology.Methods:The primary outcome was virologic suppression at Week 48 for 3-drug regimens versus DTG + 3TC (also analyzed in patient subgroup with baseline viral load >100 000 RNA copies/ml). Secondary outcomes included CD4+ cell count change from baseline and safety (adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug-related adverse events) at Week 48.Results:The network contains 14 unique regimens from 14 randomized controlled trials based on data from 10 043 patients. The proportional difference for viral suppression at 48 weeks for DTG + 3TC versus the other 13 regimens included in the network ranged from-2.7% (-11.0, 5.6%) versus DTG + tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (FTC) to 7.3% (0.6, 13.8%) versus efavirenz + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/FTC. DTG + 3TC was found to be significantly better than efavirenz + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/FTC and similar to all other regimens analysed in terms of viral suppression at 48 weeks. With regard to other outcomes (CD4+, adverse event, serious adverse event, drug-related adverse events) at 48 weeks, DTG+3TC was broadly similar to all regimens analysed.Conclusion:This network meta-analysis demonstrates similar efficacy and safety outcomes over 48 weeks with DTG + 3TC compared with traditional 3-drug antiretroviral therapy regimens.;http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201909010-00008;8.8;7.1;7.5;;31180906;;;;

Although 31 antiretrovirals have been approved by the FDA, only about half of those are commonly used. Newer, more tolerable agents have made human immunodeficiency virus into a chronic condition, which can be managed with medication. The most common antiretroviral regimens consist of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus a third agent, often an integrase inhibitor because of better tolerability and fewer drug interactions than other regimens. Understanding the dosage forms, adverse effects, and drug interactions of antiretrovirals allow clinicians to choose the most appropriate regimen for their patient. New developments, such as branded generic regimens and long-acting intramuscular injections, may play a larger role in the future.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S089155201930042X;8.2;8.9;8.5;S089155201930042X;31395145;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S089155201930042X;;

Although several meta-analyses have been conducted to determine first-line combination antiretroviral therapy, this has yet to be confirmed due to the technical limitation associated. In the present study, we applied a model-based meta-analysis (MBMA) approach, because it allows integration of information from clinical trials with varying dosing, duration, and sampling time points, resulting in enlargement of available data sources. We performed a bibliographic search to identify clinical trials involving dolutegravir (DTG)-based and efavirenz (EFV)-based regimens in HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy-naïve adults, and then identified 30 independent trial data. The time course of drug effect was described by a consecutive first-order kinetic model and analyzed using the nonlinear mixed effect modeling approach. The developed model suggests that the DTG-based regimen provides a faster-acting and more sustainable drug effect than the EFV-based regimen. Moreover, the drug effect tends to appear more slowly and decay faster in severe patients having higher viral load or smaller baseline CD4 count.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1341321X19300790;3.2;2.9;2.8;S1341321X19300790;30982724;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1341321X19300790;;

CASE PRESENTATION: We report an unusual case of follicular dendritic cell sarcoma that is coexistent with urothelial carcinoma (UC) in the urinary bladder of a 73-year-old man, who first presented with lower abdominal pain. Microscopic examination of the first transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) sample showed a neoplasm containing spindle or ovoid-shaped cells that were arranged in storiform, nested or swirling patterns. Abundant mitotic Figs. (30 mitoses/10 high-power fields) and apoptotic bodies were present. The tumor cells were positive for CD21 and vimentin, partly positive for CD23, D2-40 and CD35. After 6 weeks, the tumor recurred lately, which surprisingly contained a component of urothelial carcinoma. The first TURBT sample was then reviewed and a coexisting UC mixed with FDCS was identified by examining the deeper levels of the tumor blocks. CONCLUSIONS: This case is, to our knowledge, the first time to report the coexistence of FDCS and UC in the urinary bladder of an elderly patient. And these two tumors may share a similar molecular mechanism.;https://bmcurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12894-019-0517-x;3.3;2.7;2.4;;31488130;83;;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. T.Diffuse invasion into adjacent brain matter by glioblastoma (GBM) is largely responsible for their dismal prognosis. Previously, we showed that the TWIST1 (TW) bHLH transcription factor and its regulated gene periostin (POSTN) promote invasive phenotypes of GBM cells. Since TW functional effects are regulated by phosphorylation and dimerization, we investigated how phosphorylation of serine 68 in TW regulates TW dimerization, POSTN expression, and invasion in glioma cells. Compared with wild-type TW, the hypophosphorylation mutant, TW(S68A), impaired TW heterodimerization with the E12 bHLH transcription factor and cell invasion in vitro but had no effect on TW homodimerization. Overexpression of TW:E12 forced dimerization constructs (FDCs) increased glioma cell invasion and upregulated pro-invasive proteins, including POSTN, in concert with cytoskeletal reorganization. By contrast, TW:TW homodimer FDCs inhibited POSTN expression and cell invasion in vitro. Further, phosphorylation of analogous PXSP phosphorylation sites in TW:E12 FDCs (TW S68 and E12 S139) coordinately regulated POSTN and PDGFRa mRNA expression. These results suggested that TW regulates pro-invasive phenotypes in part through coordinated phosphorylation events in TW and E12 that promote heterodimer formation and regulate downstream targets. This new mechanistic understanding provides potential therapeutic strategies to inhibit TW-POSTN signaling in GBM and other cancers.;https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/11/9/1392;8.8;5.6;3.4;;;1392;;;

Published by BMJ.Objective Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading non-AIDS-defining causes of death among HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals. However, the evidence surrounding specific components of CVD risk remains inconclusive. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesise the available evidence and establish the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) among HIV+ compared with uninfected individuals. We also examined MI risk within subgroups of HIV+ individuals according to exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), ART class/regimen, CD4 cell count and plasma viral load (pVL) levels. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews until 18 July 2018. Furthermore, we scanned recent HIV conference abstracts (CROI, IAS/AIDS) and bibliographies of relevant articles. Eligibility criteria Original studies published after December 1999 and reporting comparative data relating to the rate of MI among HIV+ individuals were included. Data extraction and synthesis Two reviewers working in duplicate, independently extracted data. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis and reported as relative risk (RR) with 95% CI. Results Thirty-two of the 8130 identified records were included in the review. The pooled RR suggests that HIV+ individuals have a greater risk of MI compared with uninfected individuals (RR: 1.73; 95% CI 1.44 to 2.08). Depending on risk stratification, there was moderate variation according to ART uptake (RR, ART-treated=1.80; 95% CI 1.17 to 2.77; ART-untreated HIV+ individuals: 1.25; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.67, both relative to uninfected individuals). We found low CD4 count, high pVL and certain ART characteristics including cumulative ART exposure, any/cumulative use of protease inhibitors as a class, and exposure to specific ART drugs (eg, abacavir) to be importantly associated with a greater MI risk. Conclusions Our results indicate that HIV infection, low CD4, high pVL, cumulative ART use in general including certain exposure to specific ART class/regimen are associated with increased risk of MI. The association with cumulative ART may be an index of the duration of HIV infection with its attendant inflammation, and not entirely the effect of cumulative exposure to ART per se.

Blastocystis sp. is one of the most common protists infecting humans but its role in human disease is still controversial. Aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Blastocystis sp. in HIV positive and negative adults in Ghana and its association with immune status and other risk factors. Methods 122 HIV positive outpatients and 70 HIV negative blood donors from the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana, were included in the present study. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected and HIV positive patients distinguished for CD4+ T cell count <200 cells/l (n = 54) and >200 cells/l (n = 68). A Blastocystis's phylogenetic analysis was performed to determine sample subtype (ST). Results The prevalence of Blastocystis sp. in adult HIV positive individuals was lower than in HIV negative persons (6.6% vs. 20.0%, p = 0.008) and Blastocystis sp. ST1 was the most prevalent strain. Within HIV positive participants, the prevalence of Blastocystis sp. was lower in those individuals with CD4+ T cell count <200 cells/l than in patients with higher CD4+ T cell count (1.9% vs. 10.3%, p = 0.076). Multiple regression analysis revealed that Blastocystis sp. was inversely associated with an obese Body Mass Index (BMI) in HIV negative persons (p = 0.040). Presence of Blastocystis sp. was correlated with higher CD4+ T cell count in HIV positive participants (p = 0.049). Conclusion It is largely reported that people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Africa are affected from parasite infections and that co-infections may adversely impact on their immune status, accelerating progress to AIDS and worsening gastrointestinal manifestations. Differently, in this study Blastocystis sp. was associated with a better immune status jointly with a healthy body weight while it seems to be reduced with the progression of HIV infection. This data agree with recent suggestions that Blastocystis sp. can represent a component of the healthy gut microbiota.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0221968;5.7;5.4;5.2;;31479472;e0221968;;;

Methods: The ANRS 163 ETRAL trial (NCT02212379) was a 96 week, multicentre, single-arm study evaluating the efficacy and safety of raltegravir (400 mg twice daily)/etravirine (200 mg twice daily) in individuals >45 years, on a PI-containing regimen who were integrase inhibitor and etravirine naive. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with virological success, defined by the absence of virological failure up to week 48. Main secondary outcomes included evolution of metabolic parameters, CD4/CD8 count, bone mineral density and inflammatory markers. The study was designed to show an efficacy >90%, assuming a success rate 95%, with a power of 80% and a 5% type-1 error. Results: One hundred and sixty-five participants (median age 52 years, duration of ART 16.9 years, viral suppression 6.9 years and CD4 count 700 cells/mm3) were enrolled. By ITT analysis, viral suppression was maintained in 99.4% of participants (95% CI=95.6%-99.9%) at week 48 and 98.7% (95% CI=95.0%-99.7%) at week 96. Two virological failures occurred (week 24 and week 64) without emergence of integrase inhibitor resistance. Eight participants discontinued raltegravir/etravirine for adverse events, leading to a strategy success rate of 95.1% (95% CI=90.5%-97.5%) at week 48 and 92.7% (95% CI=87.5%-95.8%) at week 96.

However, in India, there has been poor uptake of polypills despite market availability. Objectives: This study sought to assess availability and cost of polypills and explore barriers and facilitators to their use in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India. Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted. Availability and cost of polypills as well as individual component drugs was assessed through a survey of pharmacies across urban, urban slum, and rural regions in state of Andhra Pradesh in India. In-depth interviews with stakeholders at each level of the health system explored barriers and facilitators to use of polypills. Results: Overall, 30 pharmacies were surveyed (10 in each of urban, urban slum, and rural region). In urban region, 2 pharmacies stocked polypills (without aspirin) costing 121 Indian rupees (INR) per 10 pills, and 1 other pharmacy stocked a polypill (with aspirin) costing 24 INR per 10 pills. All pharmacies stocked a wide range of component drugs as separate pills with combined cost of the cheapest angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, statin, and aspirin INR 124 per 10 pills. Patients were willing to use polypills if prescribed by their doctor, and pharmacies were willing to stock polypills if there was market demand. For prescribers, key barriers included perceptions that current polypills contained outdated drugs and inadequate flexibility in prescribing. Conclusions: In a market in which polypill use is licensed, their availability and use is very low. Lack of prescription of polypills was the predominant barrier to polypill use; therefore, making polypills with drugs that are more acceptable and at different available strengths, in conjunction with broader prescriber education and training, may improve their use.";https://globalheartjournal.com/article/10.1016/j.gheart.2019.07.002/;5.0;4.7;5.2;S2211816019301139;31451238;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2211816019301139;;

Published by BMJ.Objectives We assessed the prevalence and risk factors associated with virological failure among female sex workers living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Kampala, Uganda. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study between January 2015 and December 2016 using routinely collected data at a research clinic providing services to women at high risk of STIs including HIV. Plasma samples were tested for viral load from HIV-seropositive women aged 18 years who had been on ART for at least 6 months and had received adherence counselling. Samples from women with virological failure (1000 copies/mL) were tested for HIV drug resistance by population-based sequencing. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with virological failure. Results Of 584 women, 432 (74%) with a mean age of 32 (SD 6.5) were assessed, and 38 (9%) were found to have virological failure. HIV resistance testing was available for 78% (28/38), of whom 82.1% (23/28) had at least one major drug resistance mutation (DRM), most frequently M184V (70%, 16/23) and K103N (65%, 15/23). In multivariable analysis, virological failure was associated with participant age 18-24 (adjusted OR (aOR)=5.3, 95% CI 1.6 to 17.9), self-reported ART non-adherence (aOR=2.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.8) and baseline CD4+ T-cell count 350 cells/mm 3 (aOR=3.1, 95% CI 1.4 to 7.0). Conclusions A relatively low prevalence of virological failure but high rate of DRM was found in this population at high risk of transmission. Younger age, self-reported ART non-adherence and low CD4+ T-cell count on ART initiation were associated with increased risk of virological failure.;https://sti.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/sextrans-2018-053854;6.0;5.5;6.1;;31266818;;;;

Thus, during this period, the liver has important functions related to optimizing milk yield, preventing metabolic and infectious diseases, and improving fertility. To clarify the relationship between liver fatty acid metabolism and reproductive performance, the present study was conducted to assess the abundance of specific hepatic proteins related to lipid metabolism in both plasma and follicular fluid in dairy cattle with different days to conception (DC). Sixteen animals were grouped according to DC, as more and fewer DC (MDC and FDC, respectively). Blood and liver biopsies were sampled 14 days before the expected calving date and 4, 14 and 28 days after calving. The plasma beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) concentrations and the liver triacylglycerol (TAG) content were greater in the MDC group (P < 0.05), whereas the protein abundance of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 was greater in the FDC group (P < 0.05). Additionally, total bilirubin (TBil) concentration was less in the FDC than MDC group on day 28 (P < 0.05). These results indicate lipid mobilization and liver fatty acid oxidation capacity in dairy cows could contribute to the adaptations and reproductive performance.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378432018311072;3.0;2.8;3.0;S0378432018311072;31405453;106104;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0378432018311072;;

Using higher blocking voltages for WBG modules and not increasing the insulating dimensions of the module to an appropriate size, will increase electric field stress within the module. The higher electric stress, the more risk for unacceptable partial discharge (PD) activity and in turn, gradual insulation degradation, leading to breakdown and the module failure. The insulation material in the power modules vulnerable to PDs is silicone gel, which is used for encapsulation. Thus, electric field reduction techniques are proposed to address this issue. The proposed geometrical techniques cannot solve alone this issue. In this paper, we introduce a new method that is a combination of applying nonlinear field dependent conductivity (FDC) materials to high electric stress regions with geometrical techniques that can thoroughly address the electrical field enhancement issue within WBG modules.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8913210/;0;0;0;;;8913210;;true;9781728103952

Here, we present efficacy and safety data from the 100-week analysis of the trials. Methods: SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 are identically designed, randomised, open-label phase 3 studies at 65 centres in 13 countries and 60 centres in 11 countries, respectively. Adults aged 18 years or older who were on a standard three-drug or four-drug antiretroviral therapy (ART) and had had fewer than 50 HIV-1 RNA copies per mL of plasma for at least 6 months were randomly assigned (1:1) to 50 mg dolutegravir plus 25 mg rilpivirine orally once daily (early-switch group) or to continue their standard regimen for 52 weeks before switching to the dolutegravir plus rilpivirine combination (ie, the late-switch group). In this analysis of week 100 data, the efficacy endpoint of interest was the proportion of participants with fewer than 50 copies of HIV-1 RNA per mL of plasma (per the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm). This outcome was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of the study drug. Data were analysed after the last participant completed week 100 (Sept 15, 2017) and verified through the data cutoff (Nov 21, 2017). SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02429791 and NCT02422797, respectively. Findings: 513 participants were randomly assigned to dolutegravir plus rilpivirine (ie, the early-switch group) and 511 to continue their standard ART regimen, 477 of whom then switched to dolutegravir plus rilpivirine at week 52 (ie, the late-switch group). At week 100, 456 (89% [95% CI 86–92]) of 513 participants in the early-switch group and 444 (93% [91–95]) of 477 in the late-switch group had fewer than 50 HIV-1 RNA copies per mL. Drug-related adverse events occurred in 103 (20%) participants in the early-switch group and 58 (12%) in the late-switch group. The most common drug-related adverse events were headache (11 participants in the early-switch group [2%] vs eight [2%] in the late-switch group) and nausea (eight [2%] vs five [1%]). Interpretation: The combination of dolutegravir plus rilpivirine sustained virological suppression of HIV-1, was associated with a low frequency of virological failure, and had a favourable safety profile, which support its use as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-sparing and protease inhibitor-sparing alternative to three-drug regimens that reduces overall exposure to ART.

KGaA, WeinheimA method for the preparation of novel mixed-mode reversed-phase/strong cation exchange stationary phase for the separation of fixed-dose combination drugs has been developed. An epoxysilane bonded silica prepared by vapor phase deposition was used as a starting material to produce diol, octadecyl, sulfonate, and mixed octadecyl/sulfonate groups bonded silica phases. The chemical structure and surface coverage of the functional groups on these synthesized phases were confirmed by fourier-transform infrared and solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Alkylbenzene homologs, basic drugs, nucleobases and alkylaniline homologs were used as probes to demonstrate the reversed-phase, ion exchange, hydrophilic interaction and mixed-mode retention behaviors of these stationary phases. The octadecyl/sulfonate bonded silica exhibits pronounced mixed-mode retention behavior and superior retentivity and selectivity for alkylaniline homologs. The mixed-mode retention is affected by either ionic or solvent strength in the mobile phase, permiting optimization of a separation by fine tuning these parameters. The mixed-mode stationary phase was applied to separate two fixed-dose combination drugs: compound reserpine tablets and compound methoxyphenamine capsules. The results show that simultaneous separation of multiple substances in the compound dosage can be achieved on the mixed-mode phase, which makes multi-cycles of analysis for multiple components obsolete.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jssc.201900307;4.4;4.6;5.1;;31222942;;;;

General population stillbirth rates by maternal world region of origin were derived from national annual birth statistics, and compared with rates in women with HIV, using standardized stillbirth ratios with the general population as the reference.Results:Between 2007 and 2015, there were 10,434 singleton deliveries in 8090 women with HIV; 75% of pregnancies were in women of African origin; and 49% were conceived on ART. The stillbirth rate was 8.5 (95% confidence interval: 6.9 to 10.5) per 1000 births. Risk factors for stillbirth included pre-eclampsia, diabetes, Asian maternal origin (versus United Kingdom/Ireland), CD4 count <350 cells/mm3, older maternal age, and primiparity. Conceiving on ART did not increase the risk. The stillbirth rates (per 1000 births) by type of ART were 14.3, 11.7, 8.3, and 6.0, respectively for NVP + XTC/TDF-, LPV/r + 3TC/ZDV-, NVP + XTC/ABC-, and NVP + XTC/ZDV-exposed pregnancies (P value = 0.40). The standardized stillbirth ratio was 129 (95% confidence interval: 101 to 165) in women with HIV compared with the general population.Conclusion:After adjusting for maternal origin, the stillbirth rate remained higher in women with HIV than the general population.

ART was not initiated at this time. Case 2 had a single positive NAAT result at 1 month of age that prompted initiation of ART. Subsequent results were negative and ART was discontinued. Repeat negative NAAT with viral load below the limit of quantification or undetectable continued to be obtained. Shortly after and around weaning, positive NAAT results with high viral load (7.1 and 6.03 log10 copies/ml for Cases 1 and 2, respectively) were observed in both children. Both mothers were treated with tenofovir, emtricitabine and efavirenz during breastfeeding. Testing with ultrasensitive assays on early samples conclusively revealed HIV-1 proviral DNA in Case 1.

Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.Background:The World Health Organization recommends isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for people living with HIV (PLHIV) to prevent tuberculosis (TB), including pregnant women. Recent trial results suggest increased adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with IPT during pregnancy. Data are limited regarding programmatic IPT use in pregnant PLHIV.Methods:We assessed previous programmatic IPT during pregnancy among HIV-infected mothers on enrollment to an infant TB prevention trial in Kenya. Pregnancy IPT use was assessed by the estimated conception date assuming 38 weeks of gestation. Correlates of initiation and completion were analyzed by relative risk regression, using generalized linear models with log link and Poisson family adjusted for IPT initiation year.Results:Between August 15, 2016, to June 6, 2018, 300 HIV-infected women enrolled at 6 weeks postpartum. Two hundred twenty-four (74.7%) women reported previous IPT, of whom 155/224 (69.2%) had any pregnancy IPT use. Forty-five (29.0%) initiated preconception extending into early pregnancy, 41 (26.5%) initiated and completed during pregnancy, and 69 (44.5%) initiated in pregnancy and extended into early postpartum. The median gestational age at IPT pregnancy initiation was 15.1 weeks (interquartile range 8.3-28.4). Pregnancy/early postpartum IPT initiation was associated with new pregnancy HIV diagnosis [adjusted relative risk 1.9 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6 to 2.2, P < 0.001]. Six-month IPT completion rates were high [147/160 (91.9%)] among women with sufficient time to complete before trial enrollment and similar among preconception or during pregnancy initiators [adjusted relative risk 0.93 (95% confidence interval: 0.83 to 1.04, P = 0.19)].Conclusions:Programmatic IPT use was high in pregnant PLHIV, with frequent periconception and early pregnancy initiation. Programmatic surveillance could provide further insights on pregnancy IPT implementation and maternal and infant safety outcomes.;http://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAI.0000000000002086;6.9;7.0;6.4;;31408031;;;;

As such, there is strong interest in long-acting antiretroviral (ARV) agents that can be administered less frequently4. Herein, we report GS-CA1, a new archetypal small-molecule HIV capsid inhibitor with exceptional potency against HIV-2 and all major HIV-1 types, including viral variants resistant to the ARVs currently in clinical use. Mechanism-of-action studies indicate that GS-CA1 binds directly to the HIV-1 capsid and interferes with capsid-mediated nuclear import of viral DNA, HIV particle production and ordered capsid assembly. GS-CA1 selects in vitro for unfit GS-CA1-resistant capsid variants that remain fully susceptible to other classes of ARVs. Its high metabolic stability and low solubility enabled sustained drug release in mice following a single subcutaneous dosing. GS-CA1 showed high antiviral efficacy as a long-acting injectable monotherapy in a humanized mouse model of HIV-1 infection, outperforming long-acting rilpivirine. Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential of ultrapotent capsid inhibitors as new long-acting agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0560-x;47.5;48.3;45.9;;31501601;;;;

We have previously reported a dose-finding experience of high-dose chemotherapy consisting of thiotepa and melphalan (“double-conditioning regimen”). Using doses derived from that study, we have treated patients since 2005. We now report a retrospective review of patients treated by this fixed dose. Procedure: We reviewed 50 patients (median 4 years; range 0–15 years) with high-risk or relapsed/refractory solid tumors treated by this dose-fixed, double-conditioning regimen from April 2005 to May 2014. Doses were thiotepa 800 mg/m2 and melphalan 280 mg/m2 for children 2 years of age, and 32 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, respectively, for children <2 years of age. Further, doses were reduced according to creatinine clearance with poor renal function. Results: Nonhematological toxicity was mainly gastrointestinal—grade 3 mucositis (n = 41) and grade 3–4 diarrhea (n = 10). Neurological, renal, and endothelial cell toxicity and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome were not observed. There were two toxic deaths (interstitial viral pneumonia). This regimen demonstrated antitumor activity against several types of tumors. Although the frequency of gastrointestinal toxicity was high, other severe toxicity was not observed. Conclusions: Our double-conditioning regimen was very well tolerated and demonstrated antitumor activity.

Lack of data on generic formulations is a critical factor for their limited use in this country and often lead patients to refuse the generic version of the branded drug. Methods: An experimental, 2-centre, randomized, double-blind, 2-sequence, noninferiority cross-over study was designed to evaluate both the PK equivalence and clinical equivalence of multiple doses of the generic preparation of LDB, Teva Italia, compared to the originator (Madopar). Forty-three out-patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease on LDB, were recruited and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 study sequences: generic–originator or originator–generic. Clinical evaluations were performed at the end of each study period. A PK study with an LDB fixed dose (100 + 25 mg) was performed in a subpopulation of 14 subjects. Results: Clinical data showed a reduction of 0.49 and 1.54 in the mean UPDRS III scores for the LDB and the originator, respectively. The 95% CIs [2.21: 0.11] of the mean difference original vs LDB are smaller than the clinically significant difference of 3 UPDRS III points, supporting the conclusion that the treatment with LDB is not inferior to the originator. No statistically significant differences were found with respect to area under the curve to last dose, half-life, maximum concentration, time to maximum concentration and last observed concentration. Conclusion: These findings prove the therapeutic clinical equivalence as well the PK equivalence of the generic LDB and the originator (Madopar).;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bcp.14086;7.1;7.0;6.9;;31378952;;;;

However, many cancer cells express EPO receptors (EPOR), through which exogenously administered ESAs potentially promote cancer cell growth. We conducted preclinical/phase II studies to investigate the safety and efficacy of ESAs for managing chemotherapy-related anemia in DLBCL patients. We examined EPOR expression in germinal center B-cell (GCB)- and activated B-cell (ABC)-DLBCL cell lines, and investigated the effects of ESAs on cell proliferation, and rituximab-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). The clinical study enrolled 50 histologically confirmed DLBCL patients receiving rituximab/cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisolone (R-CHOP) who had hemoglobin levels <10.0 g/dl after a maximum of three R-CHOP cycles and received 4 doses of fixed-dose darbepoetin (360 g) once every 3 weeks. EPOR mRNA was detected in all GCB-DLBCL cell lines, but little/none was detected in ABC-DLBCL cell lines. GCB-DLBCL and ABC-DLBCL cell proliferation was unaffected by EPO or darbepoetin. Rituximab-mediated CDC of DLBCL cell lines with/without EPOR expression was not affected adversely by EPO. In the clinical study, baseline mean hemoglobin was 9.19 g/dl; the overall mean change in hemoglobin was 1.59 ± 1.3 g/dl (16 weeks). Forty-eight percent of enrolled patients achieved a hematopoietic response.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.OBJECTIVE The main objective of this study was to evaluate non-inferiority of office mean systolic blood pressure (BP) reduction efficacy and superiority of 24-hour ambulatory central BP reduction efficacy between losartan combined with fixed dose amlodipine (L/A group) and dose up-titrated hydrochlorothiazide (L/H group) according to office BP. METHODS We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind multicenter trial in 231 patients with hypertensive (mean age = 59.2 ± 12.2 years). Patients received losartan 50 mg monotherapy for 4 weeks, followed by additional use of amlodipine 5 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg for 20 weeks after randomization. The patients who did not achieve the BP goal after 4 weeks’ randomization received an increased dose of 100 mg/5 mg for the L/A group and 100 mg/25 mg for L/H group, respectively. The 24-hour ambulatory central BP was measured at baseline and after 20 weeks’ treatment. RESULTS Office mean systolic BP reduction of L/A group was not inferior to L/H group after 4 weeks’ treatment (–17.6 ± 13.3 vs. –14.4 ± 12.6 mm Hg, P = 0.0863) and was not significantly different after 20 weeks’ treatment. (–15.7 ± 14.0 vs. –14.7 ± 15.1 mm Hg, P = 0.6130) The 24-hour ambulatory central systolic BP was significantly more reduced in the L/A group compared with that in the L/H group after 20 weeks’ treatment (–9.37 ± 10.67 vs. –6.28 ± 10.50 mm Hg, P = 0.0407). The 24-hour ambulatory central systolic BP at the completion of the study and its reduction magnitude were independently associated with reductions in aortic pulse wave velocity, pulse pressure, and wave reflection magnitude. CONCLUSION Office systolic BP reduction with L/A was not inferior to L/H after 4 week’s treatment. The combination of losartan and amlodipine was more favorable in 24-hour ambulatory central hemodynamics beyond BP-lowering efficacy than the combination of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide, regardless of office BP.;https://academic.oup.com/ajh/article/32/10/992/5490822;6.4;5.7;5.0;;31099387;;;;

In a phase 3 trial in this setting, intracameral tropicamide/phenylephrine/lidocaine was at least as effective as a standard topical regimen of tropicamide plus phenylephrine in enabling successful capsulorhexis without the use of additional mydriatics. The intracameral preparation, which is administered via a single injection, provides rapid and sustained mydriasis through to the end of surgery, with recipients spending around half as long in preoperative/surgery rooms as standard topical regimen recipients in the phase 3 study. Moreover, significantly more of the intracameral than topical regimen recipients were free from pain or pressure in the eye/orbit before intraocular lens (IOL) implantation and had an IOL implanted without complications. Intracameral tropicamide/phenylephrine/lidocaine also displayed mydriatic efficacy in patients with diabetes in this trial. Overall, the preparation was generally well tolerated, with no serious adverse events leading to hospitalization or permanent vision loss. Thus, tropicamide/phenylephrine/lidocaine injectable solution is an emerging option for mydriasis/anaesthesia in adults undergoing cataract surgery.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40261-019-00843-z;3.7;3.5;3.9;;31471864;;;;

In the present work, a new drug-drug co amorphous system namely valsartan–nifedipine was prepared by quench cooling technique. Prepared co amorphous system was characterized for its solid state behavior with the help of Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Powder X Ray Diffractometry (PXRD). The optimized co amorphous system was stable for 1 month when exposed to accelerated stability condition (40 ± 2 °C and 75 ± 5% RH). The improved stability of amorphous nifedipine in co amorphous system was attributed to improved miscibility and intra and intermolecular non-covalent interactions mainly due to presence of hydrogen bonding between valsartan and nifedipine which was studied by FTIR analysis. Co amorphous systems were evaluated by mainly in vitro dissolution and in vivo benefit. In vitro dissolution study showed nearly 5.66 folds and 1.61 folds improvement which was translated to 3.63 and 2.19 times enhancement in vivo Cmax for nifedipine and valsartan respectively.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0928098719303197;5.7;5.4;6.6;S0928098719303197;31446077;105048;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0928098719303197;;

The diagnosis of herpes zoster was made based on the classic appearance of the rash and associated neuropathic-type pain. The diagnosis of phrenic nerve palsy was made by chest x-ray and ultrasound. Conclusion: Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of phrenic nerve palsy occurring in patients who have herpes zoster affecting the region of C3,4,5 dermatomes. Although symptoms of unilateral diaphragmatic paresis are usually mild, in patients with obesity or comorbid lung disease, new onset phrenic nerve palsy can lead to significant respiratory compromise.;https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ahs/article/view/190722;2.2;2.2;2.0;;32127803;;;;

All rights reserved.Objectives: In a context of life-long therapy, we asked whether it could be possible to reduce the number of antiretroviral drugs without jeopardizing viral suppression. Methods: ECOVIR was a prospective study aiming to assess whether in patients on combination ART with 4 antiretrovirals for 24 weeks and virally suppressed for 48 weeks, a drug-reduced (DR) regimen could be proposed. The intervention consisted of discontinuing genotypically less susceptible drugs to reach a DR regimen with 3 antiretrovirals. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients maintaining viral suppression at week (W) 24. Results: From 89 eligible individuals for the study, a DR regimen was proposed in 86 (97%) patients, of whom 71 were switched to a DR regimen. Baseline characteristics [median (IQR)] were: age 58 (53-65) years, duration of treatment 24 (21-26) years and viral suppression 8 (6-11) years. The cumulative resistance profile showed full resistance to lamivudine/emtricitabine (91%), abacavir (74%), efavirenz/nevirapine (70%), rilpivirine (56%), darunavir (q24h/q12h) (42%/29%), lopinavir (69%), atazanavir (71%) and raltegravir (24%). The final DR regimen consisted of a two-drug or three-drug regimen in 54 patients (76%) and in 17 patients (24%), respectively. The success rate of a DR regimen at W24 was 93.9% (95% CI 84.4-97.6, Kaplan-Meier estimate). Four patients experienced virological failure (at W4, W8 and W12), all with plasma viral load (pVL) <600 copies/mL and no emergence of resistance mutations. The DR strategy allowed a monthly cost saving of 36%. Conclusions: In experienced patients with high-level resistance, individualized strategies based on expert advice can offer DR regimen options with fewer drug-drug interactions and a significant economic impact while ensuring virological success.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/74/9/2716/5528379;8.7;7.7;8.3;;31273376;;;;

This generalizes Gromov's finite asymptotic dimension and is motivated by the concept of finite decomposition complexity (FDC) due to Guentner, Tessera and Yu. Regular finite decomposition complexity implies FDC and has all the permanence properties that are known for FDC, as well as a new one called Finite Quotient Permanence. We show that for a collection containing all metric families with finite asymptotic dimension, all other permanence properties follow from Fibering Permanence.;https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S1793525319500286;1.3;1.1;1.0;;;;;;

International Journal of Clinical Practice Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdAims: Five- reductase inhibitor (5ARI) therapy has been associated with sexual dysfunction in some patients. This study assessed the impact of a fixed-dose combination of the 5ARI dutasteride 0.5 mg and the 1-adrenoceptor antagonist tamsulosin 0.4 mg (DUT-TAM FDC) on Men's Sexual Health Questionnaire (MSHQ) domain scores in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Methods: This was a post hoc analysis of a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study in sexually active patients, aged 50 years, with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of BPH. Sexual activity, sexual desire, and bother domain scores of the MSHQ were assessed at baseline and at Months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Correlation between MSHQ sexual activity/desire scores and ejaculation, erection, and satisfaction domains at baseline was also evaluated. Results: In the intent-to-treat population (N = 489), 243 and 246 patients were randomised to DUT-TAM FDC and placebo groups, respectively. Compared with placebo, DUT-TAM FDC therapy resulted in statistically significant reductions (worsening) from baseline in adjusted mean MSHQ sexual activity and bother domain scores at Months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 (all P < 0.05) and in adjusted mean MSHQ sexual desire domain scores at Months 6, 9, and 12 (all P < 0.05). Significant moderate correlations in the expected direction were observed at baseline between the sexual activity/desire domains and the ejaculation, erection, and satisfaction domains (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: These findings help clarify the degree and impact of libido changes in sexually active men treated with DUT-TAM FDC and may support clinical decision-making.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ijcp.13282;4.6;4.4;4.3;;30317693;;;;

In vivo, the prodrug is readily metabolized to abiraterone and its active metabolite (4)-abiraterone (D4A) which selectively and irreversibly inhibit the 17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1) enzyme and the androgen receptor, respectively. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of abiraterone and its metabolites may be beneficial as significant pharmacokinetic variability has been observed. Dried plasma spots (DPS) represent an attractive, yet under-utilised approach for TDM analysis with desired features including easy collection, transport, storage and overcomes the issues of blood hematocrit levels known in dried blood spot analysis. In this study we developed and validated a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay for the simultaneous quantification of abiraterone and D4A with deuterated internal standard (abiraterone D4) from DPS using a high-resolution benchtop mass spectrometer. Calibration curves were linear over a wide and clinically-relevant concentration range (0.132–196.0 ng/mL for abiraterone and 0.110–39.17 ng/mL for D4A) with high accuracy (93–104% for abiraterone and 96–108% for D4A) and precision (%CV  12.5). As expected, the levels of abiraterone and D4A obtained from DPS from mCRPC patients varied substantially (1.5–31.4 ng/mL for abiraterone and 0.1–5.2 ng/mL for D4A; n = 22). Detailed benchmarking of the DPS method to a pre-validated liquid plasma method showed that the techniques generate quantitative indistinguishable data. Collectively, this demonstrates the potential of using LC-MS/MS in combination with DPS for TDM of abiraterone and D4A from patients.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1570023219302636;4.4;4.5;5.4;S1570023219302636;31421381;121741;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1570023219302636;;

Amylin or its triple proline analog pramlintide are not compatible in solution with insulin. The drug candidate hAmy-PEG5k is a novel monoPEGylated amylin derivative with improved physicochemical properties and retained similar pharmacological activity compared to free amylin and pramlintide. We have investigated the short- and long-term physicochemical compatibility of hAmy-PEG5k co-formulated with slow-acting human insulin analogs glargine or detemir. While human amylin promptly aggregates over a large range of pH, and both free and in the presence of regular, glargine or detemir insulin, the hAmy-PEG5k analog is stable at these conditions as shown by Thioflavin T (ThT) binding assay. When hAmy-PEG5k (100 or 500 µg/mL) was added to the commercial formulations of either insulin glargine or detemir (95 IU/mL), the combinations remained stable after 6 months stored at 4 °C, as probed by ThT, dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses, confirming the absence of amyloid fibers, minor aggregation products or loss of material. These results suggest hAmy-PEG5k and the insulin analogs glargine and detemir are physicochemically compatible and are candidate ready-to-use fixed-dose combinations.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10837450.2019.1621896;3.3;3.5;3.7;;31124388;;;;

Here, we report provincial estimates of undetectable and suppressed viral load among pregnant or breastfeeding women in HIV care in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and associated risk factors. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted as part of a baseline assessment for the CQI-PMTCT study: an ongoing cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effect of continuous quality interventions (CQI) on long-term ART outcomes among pregnant and breastfeeding women (NCT03048669). From November 2016 to June 2018, in each of the 35 Kinshasa provincial health zones (HZ), study teams visited the three busiest maternal and child health clinics, enrolled all HIV-positive pregnant or breastfeeding women (1 year post-delivery) receiving ART, and performed viral load testing. Log binomial models with generalized estimating equations to account for clustering at the HZ level, were used to estimate prevalence ratios comparing participants with undetected (<40 copies/mL) or suppressed (<1000 copies/mL) viral load across levels of individual and site characteristics. Results: Of the 1752 eligible women, 1623 had viral load results available, including 38% who had been on ART for <6 months and 74% were on tenofovir-lamivudine-efavirenz. Viral load was undetectable in 53% of women and suppressed in 62%. Among women who were on ART for 12 months, only 60% and 67% respectively, had undetectable or suppressed viral load. Viral load was undetectable in 53%, 48% and 58% of women testing during pregnancy, at delivery, and in postpartum respectively. In multivariable log binomial models, duration of ART >12 months, older age, being married, disclosure of HIV status, receiving care in an urban health zone or one supported by PEPFAR were all positively associated with viral suppression. Conclusions: The observed high level of detectable viral load suggests that high ART coverage alone without substantial efforts to improve the quality of care for pregnant and breastfeeding women, will not be enough to achieve the goal of virtual elimination of vertical HIV transmission in high-burden and limited resources settings like DRC.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jia2.25376;5.5;6.7;7.1;;31496051;e25376;;;

We determined drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and evaluated the predictive efficacy of a TLD containing regimen for viremic adolescents and young adults in Harare, Zimbabwe.Methods:We sequenced plasma viral RNA from HIV-1-infected adolescents and young adults on 1st and 2nd-line ART with confirmed virologic failure (viral load >1000 copies/ml) and calculated total genotypic susceptibility scores to current 2nd, 3rd line and DTG regimens.Results:A total of 160 participants were genotyped; 112 (70%) on 1st line and 48 (30%) on 2nd line, median (interquartile range) age 18 (15-19) and duration of ART (interquartile range) was 6 (4-8) years. Major DRMs were present in 94 and 67% of 1st and 2nd-line failures, respectively (P < 0.001). Dual class resistance to nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nonnucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors was detected in 96 (60%) of 1st-line failures; protease inhibitor DRMs were detected in a minority (10%) of 2nd-line failures. A total genotypic susceptibility score of 2 or less may risk protease inhibitor or DTG monotherapy in 11 and 42% of 1st-line failures switching to 2nd-line protease inhibitor and TLD respectively.Conclusion:Among adolescents and young adults, current protease inhibitor-based 2nd-line therapies are poorly tolerated, more expensive and adherence is poor. In 1st-line failure, implementation of TLD for many adolescents and young adults on long-term ART may require additional active drug(s). Drug resistance surveillance and susceptibility scores may inform strategies for the implementation of TLD.";http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201909010-00007;8.8;7.1;7.5;;31361272;;;;

Low adherence to medication seems likely to be a factor. We report a scoping review of studies on adherence to antihypertensive therapy (AHT) in Russia to determine the extent of research undertaken, the frequency of adherence among adults diagnosed with HT, methodologies used in the studies, and their ability to describe determinants of adherence. Methods: A scoping review of published studies that have assessed adherence to AHT in Russian HT patients searched the main Russian and international electronic databases eLIBRARY.ru, Russian Medicine, Embase, MEDLINE for full-text reports published in the Russian language between 2000 and 2017. The last search was on November 28, 2017. Among 520 reports identified, 31 were included in the review. Results: Eighteen studies assessed adherence using the 4-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4); others used bespoke questionnaires or pill counts. 25 studies assessed levels of adherence, 11 examined its determinants, and 18 examined intervention strategies. The proportion of ""adherent"" patients varied from 11 to 44% using the MMAS-4, from 23 to 74% when using bespoke questionnaires, and from 5 to 43% when using pill counts. Adherence was associated with sociodemographic factors, access to free drugs provided through the Medicine Assistance Scheme (MAS), use of home blood pressure (BP) monitoring, anxiety, and comorbidity. There was no evidence that adherence was associated with income or physical activity. Evidence of an association between MAS, grade of HT, or experience of hypertensive crisis was inconclusive. Various methods to improve adherence were studied including patient education (improved from 1.8 to 3.9 points, p = 0.0002 or 2.80 to 3.79 points, p < 0.0001 measured by the MMAS-4), telephone reminders (p < 0.0001), training in home BP monitoring (p < 0.05), and use of fixed-dose combinations (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The main determinants of adherence to AHT are sociodemographic characteristics, the severity of HT, and presence of comorbidity. Patient education and use of fixed-dose combinations of drugs were identified as most important for improving adherence.

Prior to FDC development, pharmacokinetic properties of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) have to be evaluated, as well as methods for their determination developed. So as to increase patient compliance in inflammatory bowel disease, three novel FDCs of thiopurine immunosuppressants and folic acid are proposed; physico-chemical and pharmacokinetic properties such as hydrophobicity, lipophilicity and plasma protein binding of all APIs are evaluated. Moreover, experimental results of different properties are compared to those computed by various on-line prediction platforms so as to evaluate the viability of the in silico approach. A simultaneous method for their determination is developed, optimized, validated and applied to commercial tablet formulations. The method has shown to be fast, selective, accurate and precise, showing potential for reliable determination of API content in proposed FDCs during its development.";https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/24/19/3469;4.5;4.1;4.1;;31554326;3469;;;

Upon combining several data sources, an empirical diagram between a densimetric Froude number Fdc=Uc/gh and relative roughness N=d/h was recently reported over some six decades of N, where d is the grain diameter, h is the overlying boundary-layer depth, Uc is the bulk velocity at which sediment motion is initiated, g is the gravitational acceleration, =s-1, and s is the specific gravity of sediments. This diagram featured three approximate scaling laws of the form FdcN- with =1/2 at small N, =1/6 at intermediate N, and =0 at large N. The individual  values were piecewisely recovered using a combination of (1) scaling arguments linking bulk to local flow variables above the sediment bed and (2) assumed exponents  for the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum Etke(k)k-, where k is the wave number or inverse eddy size. To explain the =1/2, the aforementioned derivation further assumed the presence of an inverse cascade in Etke(k) at large wave number (i.e., =3). It is shown here that a single Fdc-N curve can be derived using a cospectral budget (CSB) model formulated just above the sediment bed. For any k, the proposed CSB model includes two primary mechanisms: (1) a turbulent stress generation formed by the mean velocity gradient and the spectrum of the vertical velocity Eww(k) and (2) a destruction term formed by pressure-velocity interactions. Hence, a departure from prior work is that the proposed CSB model is driven by a multiscaled Eww(k) instead of Etke(k) characterized by a single exponent. Also, the CSB model does not require the presence of an inverse cascade to recover an =1/2. Last, the CSB approach makes it clear that the scaling parameters linking local to bulk flow variables used in prior determinations of  at various N must be revised to account for bed roughness effects.;https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.4.093801;0.8;2.0;3.4;;;093801;;;

In this single-arm, open-label, phase 3, deferred treatment study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir among patients randomized to the placebo group in the ASTRAL-1 study. Patients received sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (400/100 mg) once daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of therapy (SVR12). The primary safety endpoint was any adverse events (AEs) leading to the permanent discontinuation of study drug. Overall, 108/111 (97%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 92%-99%) achieved SVR12, and only one patient had virological failure. SVR12 was achieved by 61/63 (97%, 95%CI, 89%-100%) genotype 1 patients, 20/20 (100%; 95%CI, 83%-100%) with genotype 2, 19/19 (100%; 95%CI, 82%-100%) with genotype 4 and 8/9 (89%; 95% CI, 52%-100%) with genotype 6. All (19/19; 95%CI, 82-100) patients with cirrhosis and all (31/31, 95%CI, 89-100) with prior treatment experience achieved SVR12. The safety profile during treatment was similar to that observed in patients receiving placebo treatment. The most common AEs were headache, fatigue and nausea. One patient (1%) discontinued treatment due to an AE of gallbladder carcinoma, which was not considered related to treatment. Of five reported serious AEs, none were considered related to study drug. Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir for 12 weeks was effective and well tolerated among untreated and previously treated patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, 4 or 6 infection, including those with compensated cirrhosis (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02346721).";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jvh.13159;8.0;6.6;6.0;;31216086;;;;

METHODS: This Phase 3, double-blind, multicenter study enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe depression and nonresponse to 2 antidepressants in the current depression episode. Eligible patients (N = 346) were randomized (1:1:1) to twice-weekly nasal spray treatment (esketamine [56 or 84 mg] or placebo) plus a newly initiated, open-label, oral antidepressant taken daily for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to day 28 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score, performed by blinded, remote raters. Based on the predefined statistical testing sequence, esketamine 84 mg/antidepressant had to be significant for esketamine 56 mg/antidepressant to be formally tested. RESULTS: Statistical significance was not achieved with esketamine 84 mg/antidepressant compared with antidepressant/placebo (least squares [LS] means difference [95% CI]: -3.2 [-6.88, 0.45]; 2-sided P value = .088). Although esketamine 56 mg/antidepressant could not be formally tested, the LS means difference was -4.1 [-7.67, -0.49] (nominal 2-sided P value = .027). The most common (>20%) adverse events reported for esketamine/antidepressant were nausea, dissociation, dizziness, vertigo, and headache. CONCLUSIONS: Statistical significance was not achieved for the primary endpoint; nevertheless, the treatment effect (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) for both esketamine/antidepressant groups exceeded what has been considered clinically meaningful for approved antidepressants vs placebo. Safety was similar between esketamine/antidepressant groups and no new dose-related safety concerns were identified. This study provides supportive evidence for the safety and efficacy of esketamine nasal spray as a new, rapid-acting antidepressant for patients with treatment-resistant depression.

All rights reserved.Background: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a critical infectious, contagious disease worldwide with high prevalence and mortality rate. The directly observed treatment short-course therapy includes rifampicin (RMP) and isoniazid (INH) for at least 6 months. The purposes of this scheme are to interrupt the transmissibility of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and to avoid secondary complications. Low plasma concentrations of these anti-TB drugs have been associated with extended treatment duration, therapeutic failure, and relapse. The determination of anthropometric, genetic, and clinical variables that may affect plasma concentrations of RMP and INH might facilitate the detection of patients at increased risk of therapeutic failure. Methods: A prospective observational study was performed in patients with TB diagnosis. A fixed-dose combined formulation was administered following clinical guidelines, and 12 venous blood samples were collected within 24 hours after dose for the quantification of plasma levels of RMP and INH by high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet. The plasma concentrations versus time for each drug in each patient were assessed by a noncompartmental approach to obtain Cmax, and the area under the concentration-time curve to the last observation point (AUC0-24 h) was calculated by the linear trapezoidal rule. Genetic polymorphisms of the enzyme involved in INH metabolism (NAT2) and proteins involved in RMP transport (glycoprotein-P and OATP1B1) were determined. Results: A total of 34 patients aged between 18 and 72 years with the diagnosis of TB were included in the current study. A multivariate analysis was performed to determine the anthropometric and genetic characteristics that modified the Cmax and AUC0-24 h of RMP and INH. Results indicated that RMP Cmax and AUC0-24 h were affected by sex, dose/weight, and single nucleotide polymorphism of MDR1. In addition, age, body mass index, and NAT2 acetylator genotype were shown to determine the Cmax and AUC0-24 h for INH. Conclusions: Anthropometric, genetic, and dosage characteristics of Mexican patients with TB are an important source of risk for subtherapeutic plasma concentrations of anti-TB drugs. Factors such as lower-than-recommended RMP dose, male patients with TB, and MDR1 3435 genotype, in addition to age group, body mass index, and INH acetylator phenotype based on NAT2 genotype, should be considered during treatment.;http://journals.lww.com/00007691-201910000-00015;4.3;3.9;4.0;;30939588;;;;

We investigated the association between first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016, and the risk of DM in adults. Method: We selected all HIV-infected adults within the Thai National AIDS Program who started a first-line ART regimen consisting the following between October 2006 and September 2013: zidovudine+lamivudine+nevirapine; tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)+lamivudine+nevirapine; zidovudine+lamivudine+efavirenz; TDF+lamivudine/emtricitabine+efavirenz; zidovudine+lamivudine+ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r); or TDF+lamivudine+LPV/r. Diagnosis of DM was defined as having at least 2 of the following characteristics: fasting plasma glucose 126 mg/dl, 2010 WHO ICD-10 codes E11-E14, or prescription of antidiabetic drugs. To identify ART regimens associated with DM, we used competing risks regression models that considered mortality without DM as a competing event and adjusted for sex, age, pancreas disease, and stratified by groups defined by a score summarizing the propensity to receive a specific first-line ART regimen. Results: Data from 35 710 adults (49.1% male; median age, 35.0 years; median follow-up, 2.0 years) were included. In the multivariable analysis with zidovudine+lamivudine+nevirapine as the reference group, a higher risk of DM was observed with TDF+lamivudine/emtricitabine+efavirenz (adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio [aSHR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-1.9), zidovudine+lamivudine+efavirenz (aSHR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.7-2.3), and TDF+lamivudine+LPV/r (aSHR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.9-3.9). Conclusions: Several of the WHO recommended ART regimens, particularly tenofovir + lamivudine +LPV/r and regimens containing efavirenz, may be associated with an increased risk of DM.";https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofz298/5578470;3.5;4.6;3.8;;;ofz298;;;

This paper outlines conceptual frameworks of three primary stroke prevention strategies: (a) the “polypill” strategy; (b) a “population-wide” strategy; and (c) a “motivational population-wide” strategy. (a) A polypill containing generic low-dose ingredients of blood pressure and lipid-lowering medications (e.g. candesartan 16 mg, amlodipine 2.5 mg, and rosuvastatin 10 mg) seems a safe and cost-effective approach for primary prevention of stroke and dementia. (b) A population-wide strategy reducing cardiovascular risk factors in the whole population, regardless of the level of risk is the most effective primary prevention strategy. A motivational population-wide strategy for the modification of health behaviors (e.g. smoking, diet, physical activity) should be based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy. Mobile technologies, such as smartphones, offer an ideal interface for behavioral interventions (e.g. Stroke Riskometer app) even in LMICs. (c) Community health workers can improve the maintenance of lifestyle changes as well as the adherence to medication, especially in resource poor areas. An adequate training of community health workers is a key point. Conclusion: An effective primary stroke prevention strategy on a global scale should integrate pharmacological (polypill) and lifestyle modifications (motivational population-wide strategy) interventions. Side effects of such an integrative approach are expected to be minimal and the benefits among individuals at low-to-moderate risk of stroke could be significant.

The objectives of this analysis were to characterize the relationship between drug exposure and sustained virologic response at posttreatment week 12 (SVR12) in HCV-infected subjects and to evaluate the impact of demographic covariates and clinical factors on the exposure-response (E-R) relationship. The E-R efficacy analysis was performed with data from phase 2 and phase 3 studies in HCV-infected subjects treated with the 3DAA regimen. The relationship between the probability of achieving SVR12 and exposure to daclatasvir, asunaprevir, and beclabuvir was described using a logistic regression model and included assessments of the potential covariate effects. The impacts of the covariates on the rate of SVR12 and interactions of covariates with the individual drug effects were tested. The final model for SVR12 included effects of non–genotype-1a status, resistance-associated NS5A-Q30 substitution in genotype-1a subjects, and baseline RNA level on the intercept, and effect of prior peg-interferon failure on the beclabuvir slope. Sex, race, age, weight, fibrosis score, alanine transaminase, and cirrhosis status had no statistically significant impact on the rate of SVR12. The individual E-R relationships with each drug, were relatively flat, and the effects of exposure were not significant. With the exception of the NS5A-Q30 substitution in genotype-1a subjects, statistically significant covariate effects had little impact on SVR12 rates. Overall, the E-R model was developed that captured the high SVR12 rates and the effect of covariates for the 3DAA regimen in HCV-infected patients.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpdd.646;2.4;3.0;3.2;;30667592;;;;

Germinal center (GC) activation is limited due to poorly developed follicular dendritic cells (FDC), causing generation of few antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) with limited survival and transient antibody responses. Herein, we compared the potential of five adjuvants, namely LT-K63, mmCT, MF59, IC31, and alum to overcome limitations of the neonatal immune system and to enhance and prolong responses of neonatal mice to a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Pnc1-TT. The adjuvants LT-K63, mmCT, MF59, and IC31 significantly enhanced GC formation and FDC maturation in neonatal mice when co-administered with Pnc1-TT. This enhanced GC induction correlated with significantly enhanced vaccine-specific ASCs by LT-K63, mmCT, and MF59 in spleen 14 days after immunization. Furthermore, mmCT, MF59, and IC31 prolonged the induction of vaccine-specific ASCs in spleen and increased their persistence in bone marrow up to 9 weeks after immunization, as previously shown for LT-K63. Accordingly, serum Abs persisted above protective levels against pneumococcal bacteremia and pneumonia. In contrast, alum only enhanced the primary induction of vaccine-specific IgG Abs, which was transient. Our comparative study demonstrated that, in contrast to alum, LT-K63, mmCT, MF59, and IC31 can overcome limitations of the neonatal immune system and enhance both induction and persistence of protective immune response when administered with Pnc1-TT. These adjuvants are promising candidates for early life vaccination.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2019.02214/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;31616417;2214;;;

Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 licenseBackground: Fewer than 25% of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in countries of low and middle income (LMICs) use guideline-directed drugs for secondary prevention. A fixed-dose combination polypill might improve cardiovascular outcomes by increasing prescription rates and adherence, but the cost-effectiveness of this approach is uncertain. Methods: We developed microsimulation models to assess the cost-effectiveness of a polypill containing aspirin, lisinopril, atenolol, and simvastatin for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease compared with current care in China, India, Mexico, Nigeria, and South Africa. We modelled baseline use of secondary prevention drugs on the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiological study. In the intervention arm, we assumed that patients currently prescribed any prevention drug for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease would receive the polypill instead, which would improve adherence by 32% (from a meta-analysis of two randomised trials in LMICs). We assessed the cost-effectiveness of the polypill at prices in the public sector and on the retail market. Key outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) over a 5-year period and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from the perspective of the health-care sector and a lifetime analytical horizon. We assumed a cost-effectiveness threshold equal to each country's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. In sensitivity analyses, we examined the population health effect achievable by increasing the uptake of the polypill in the eligible population. Findings: Among adults aged 30–84 years with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, adoption of the polypill for secondary prevention compared with current care was projected to avert 40–54 major adverse cardiovascular events for every 1000 patients treated for 5 years and produce between three and ten additional serious adverse events. Assuming public-sector pharmaceutical prices, the ICER of the polypill compared with current care over a lifetime analytical horizon was Int$168 (95% UI 55 to 337) per DALY averted in China, $154 (57 to 289) in India, $88 (15 to 193) in Mexico, $364 (147 to 692) in Nigeria, and $64 (cost-saving to 203) in South Africa, amounting to 0·4–6·2% of the per capita GDP in these countries. The ICER of the polypill compared with current care increased to 3·3–14·6% of the per capita GDP at retail market pharmaceutical prices. Use of the polypill at current rates of prescription of secondary prevention drugs would produce modest health benefits, reducing DALYs from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease among patients with established disease by 3·1–10·1% over 10 years. Increasing use to 50% or 75% of the eligible population would produce substantially larger health gains (up to 24·3% atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease DALYs averted). Interpretation: The polypill is projected to be cost-effective compared with current care for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in China, India, Mexico, Nigeria, and South Africa, particularly if it is made available at public-sector pricing. However, achieving meaningful improvements in cardiovascular health will require simultaneous investments in health infrastructure to increase the uptake of the polypill among patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Nevertheless, questions remain regarding the optimal patient population for triple therapy as well as the benefit:risk ratio of ICS treatment. Methods: ETHOS is an ongoing, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group, 52-week study in symptomatic patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD and a history of exacerbation(s) in the previous year. Two doses of single inhaler triple therapy with budesonide/glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate metered dose inhaler (BGF MDI 320/18/9.6 g and 160/18/9.6 g) will be compared to glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate (GFF) MDI 18/9.6 g and budesonide/formoterol fumarate (BFF) MDI 320/9.6 g, all formulated using co-suspension delivery technology. Outcomes include the rate of moderate/severe (primary endpoint) and severe COPD exacerbations, symptoms, quality of life, and all-cause mortality. Sub-studies will assess lung function and cardiovascular safety. Study population: From June 2015–July 2018, 16,044 patients were screened and 8572 were randomized. Preliminary baseline demographics show that 55.9% of patients had experienced 2 moderate/severe exacerbations in the previous year, 79.1% were receiving an ICS-containing treatment at study entry, and 59.9% had blood eosinophil counts 150 cells/mm3. Conclusions: ETHOS will provide data on exacerbations, patient-reported outcomes, mortality, and safety in 8572 patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD receiving triple and dual fixed-dose combinations. For the first time, ICS/LAMA/LABA triple therapy with two different doses of ICS will be compared to dual ICS/LABA and LAMA/LABA therapies.

All rights reserved.Background: There is an increasing interest in two-drug regimens. We hypothesized that maintenance therapy with raltegravir and lamivudine would keep HIV-1 suppressed and be well tolerated. Methods: Virally suppressed HIV-1-infected adults without previous viral failures or known resistance mutations to integrase inhibitors or 3TC/FTC or chronic hepatitis B were randomized 2:1 to switch to fixed-dose combination 150mg lamivudine/300mg raltegravir twice daily or to continue therapy. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients free of therapeutic failure (defined as viral failure, change in treatment for any reason, consent withdrawal, loss to follow-up or death) at week 24. Secondary outcomes were changes in laboratory, body composition, sleep quality, adherence, and adverse effects. Results: There were 75 patients included: men 78%; median age 50 years; median CD4+ 622/l. At week 24, 7 (9%) patients had therapeutic failure: raltegravir and lamivudine 2 (4%) vs. control 5 (20%). The difference in proportions of therapeutic failures raltegravir and lamivudine minus control was -0.159 (95% confidence interval: -0.353 to -0.012). There was a trend to more weight gain with raltegravir and lamivudine, but no significant changes in other secondary outcomes. Sixty-four percent of patients in each arm had at least one adverse effect. Two (6%) patients in control arm and 4 (7%) patients in raltegravir and lamivudine arm had severe adverse effects. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that switching to raltegravir along with lamivudine in patients with viral suppression maintains efficacy and is well tolerated. A larger study of longer duration is required to confirm these findings.";http://journals.lww.com/00002030-201910010-00009;8.8;7.1;7.5;;31335805;;;;

It is approved in China to reduce the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer therapy associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia. In phase III trials, once per cycle prophylaxis with mecapegfilgrastim was more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of grade  3 neutropenia in cycle 1 in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and was more effective than filgrastim at reducing the mean duration of grade  3 neutropenia in cycle 1 in patients with breast cancer. The tolerability and safety profiles of mecapegfilgrastim were similar to those of filgrastim, with no unexpected adverse events (AEs); most adverse reactions in cycle 1 were mild or moderate in severity.

In the biofuel production process, the extraction technique is a key technology with respect to energy consumption and product value. In this review, recent advances related to the extraction process in biofuel production are discussed. The major extraction methods were classified as conventional solvent extraction (CSE), physical-supported solvent extraction (PSSE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), and novel extractions. We address each of these classified extraction methods in turn both in relation to the feedstock utilized in the different biofuel generation methods and to the targeted biofuels. Our objective is to provide a concise, timely, and comprehensive review on various extraction methods applied/studied regarding biofuel production, their principles and advantages/limitations, and recent case studies. In particular, the classified extraction methods in the production of third-generation algal biofuel were intensively evaluated. Consequently, the concept of free from drying and cell disruption (FDC) routes was advanced herein as it may possess the potential to reduce the requirement for input energy during the production of algae biofuels.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S037838201930219X;7.3;7.9;9.5;S037838201930219X;;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S037838201930219X;;

The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the horizontal resolution of climate data on streamflow simulations in terms of low and high flows using flow-duration curves (FDCs). For this study, observed climate information and two downscaled climate datasets with different horizontal resolutions (5 km and 20 km) generated by the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model forced by ERA-Interim reanalysis data are used. To generate streamflow, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used. This study focuses on three dam basins in the Han River basin, Korea. Although the annual precipitation in the Han River basin derived from WRF20 is higher than the observed precipitation and the results of WRF05, the magnitude and number of extreme events are underestimated compared to those of the observed and WRF05 precipitation. In addition, the annual maximum daily streamflow and 95% flow driven by the WRF05 exhibit notable improvements compared to those driven by WRF20. Although dynamical downscaling demands significant computational costs, the production of fine-scale climate simulation is necessary to improve the precipitation characteristics that can critically influence low and high flows in Korea in areas with complex geographical features.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11269-019-02359-9;5.0;5.2;5.4;;;;;;

All rights reserved.American geostationary satellites have had a band sensitive to fires for over 30. years. In the 1990s, the automated biomass burning algorithm (ABBA) was developed using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-7 and GOES-8 data, and it saw extensive use monitoring burning in South America. Its successor, the wildfire ABBA (WFABBA), designed to run on the entire hemisphere, became an operational product in 2002, and it was later designated as a baseline, day one product for the GOES-R Series. GOES-R presents a leap forward in capability to detect and characterize fires. As with previous GOES, Level 1b imagery can be monitored manually to catch fire signals, and the automated algorithm, the fire detection and characterization algorithm (FDCA), provides fire locations and characteristics, fire radiative power, fire size, and fire temperature at high temporal cadence. FDCA data are used by aerosol and smoke modelers, providing them with trendlines that can improve their forecasts by replacing assumptions about fire behavior. National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters use FDCA data and the plain imagery to identify fires, particularly when the fire danger is high. The improvements brought to the table by the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) with respect to fire detection and characterization have yet to be fully explored.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780128143278000135;0;0;0;B9780128143278000135;;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/3-s2.0-B9780128143278000135;true;9780128143278

An optimization problem was set up to determine the 3 strengths of the drugs of the mini-tablet and 4 cutoff points that define the weight bands of a dosing chart, simultaneously. Using Monte Carlo simulations, first, exposure targets were determined for the 3 drugs, from published population pharmacokinetic models for adults, assuming that the approved doses for adults are de facto efficacious. Then optimal strengths and cutoff points were determined by matching children exposures generated from population pharmacokinetic models to the adults targets. The optimal dosing strengths of the FDC tablet were found to be 95 mg of rifampicin, 200 mg of pyrazinamide and 75 mg of isoniazid, and the 4 body weight bands for 1 to 4 mini-tablets, respectively were: 4 to 8 kg, 8 to 12 kg, 12 to 18 kg and 18 to 28 kg. Children with body weight  28 kg will be treated with adult dosages. The higher doses proposed were evaluated to be much closer to the adult targets compared to the existing recommended by WHO paediatric doses.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0928098719302805;5.7;5.4;6.6;S0928098719302805;31356869;105016;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0928098719302805;;

The use of polypills in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has received broad support; however, the use of polypills in the primary prevention of CVD is more controversial. This controversy stems from an inherent resistance to the medicalization of primary prevention, and the lower CVD event rate in this population means that smaller absolute benefits are derived. Indeed, drug-related adverse effects, such as from aspirin, might even outweigh the benefits. The role of fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapy for blood pressure (BP) lowering in combatting the widespread undertreatment of high BP — the leading modifiable risk factor contributing to the global burden of CVD — has gained momentum. Increasing evidence suggests that FDC pills containing multiple low doses of BP-lowering drugs produce more effective BP lowering than the use of fewer separate BP-lowering drugs at higher doses, without an increase in adverse effects. Trials of FDC pills comprising three half-dose or four quarter-dose BP-lowering drugs have shown substantial efficacy. In this Review, we summarize the current evidence on low-dose BP-lowering FDC pills and the justification for this approach in the context of polypills in the primary prevention of CVD.";http://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-019-0209-y;21.0;24.0;19.9;;31150009;;;;

Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.This study sought to examine the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genetic diversity on drug resistance among men who have sex with men (MSM) with virologic failure in antiretroviral therapy (ART), and investigate linking-associated factors for genetic transmission networks.Seven hundred and thirty-four HIV-positive MSM with virologic failure in ART were recruited into our study from 2011 to 2017. HIV-1 pol gene sequences were used for phylogenetic and genotypic drug resistance analyses. The drug resistance mutations were determined using the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database. The genetic transmission networks were analyzed for CRF01-AE and CRF07-BC sequences by the genetic distance-based method.Of 734 subjects, 372 (50.68%) showed drug resistance, in which CRF01-AE and CRF07-BC were the predominating subtypes. Drug resistance more frequently occurred in non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) treatment (48.64%), and followed by nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (36.51%) and PIs (4.03%). The most common drug resistance-associated mutations in protease inhibitors (PIs), NRTIs and NNRTIs were K20I/R, M184V/I and K103N/KN, respectively. For 283CRF01-AE sequences, 64 (22.61%) fell into clusters at a genetic distance of 0.011, resulting in 17 clusters ranging in size from 2 to 16 individuals. For 230 CRF07-BC sequences, 66 (28.69%) were connected to at least one other sequence with 0.005 genetic distances, resulting in 8 clusters ranging in size from 2 to 52 individuals. Individuals who showed drug resistance to ART were less likely to fall into clusters than those who did not. The genetic linkage was robust by the exclusion of sites associated with drug resistance.CRF01-AE and CRF07-BC were the main strains among MSM with virologic failure in ART, and the drug resistance more frequently occurred in NNRTIs, followed by NRTIs and PIs. Genetic transmission networks revealed a complexity of transmission pattern, suggesting early-diagnosis and in-time intervention among MSM.;http://journals.lww.com/00005792-201910250-00032;2.1;2.7;2.7;;31651864;e17585;;;

Given that relievers are commonly prescribed as pressurized metred-dose inhalers (pMDI), changing preventers from dry powder inhalers (DPI) to pMDI may improve asthma outcomes. This study aimed to assess the persistence and effectiveness of switching from DPI to pMDI for inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting 2-agonist combination therapy (ICS/LABA). Methods: This was a historical cohort study using Ajou University Hospital (Korea) patient records. Persistence of switch was defined as receiving 1 pMDI and no DPI after the switch. Effectiveness of switch was assessed as the proportion without severe asthma exacerbation and the proportion achieving risk domain asthma control (RDAC; no asthma-related hospitalization, antibiotics without upper respiratory diagnosis or acute course of oral corticosteroids) and overall asthma control (OAC; RDAC and  200 g salbutamol/500 g terbutaline average daily dose) comparing 1 year after and before the switch. Results: Within 85 patients who switched from DPI to pMDI and persisted for a year, higher proportion were free from asthma exacerbation after the switch (mean difference in proportion = 0.129, 95% CI: 0.038–0.220). Switching to pMDI was also associated with better RDAC (75.3% vs 57.7%, P = 0.001) and OAC (57.7% vs 45.9%, P = 0.021). From the entire 117 patients who switched to fixed-dose combination (FDC)/ICS LABA pMDI, 76.1% (95% CI: 69.0–100.0%) patients persisted in the following 6 months. Conclusion: Switching to and persisting with pMDI was associated with decreased asthma exacerbations and improved asthma control.

Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of approved and emerging NNRTIs. Areas covered: This review covers the latest trend of NNRTIs regarding their pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of drug action, drug resistance as well as new applications such as two-drug regimens and long-acting formulations. Expert opinion: Since the first NNRTI, nevirapine, was approved in 1996, antiviral drug discovery led to the approval of seven NNRTIs, including nevirapine, delavirdine (discontinued), etravirine, elsulfavirine, efavirenz, rilpivirine, and doravirine. The latter three compounds with favorable pharmacodynamic profiles and minimal adverse effects are often combined with one integrase inhibitor or two NRTIs in once-daily fixed-dose tablets. NNRTI-anchored regimens have been approved as initial therapies in treatment-naïve patients (efficacy: 72% to 86%) or maintaining therapies in virologically-suppressed patients (efficacy: 91% to 95%). Future development of NNRTIs includes: (i) better resistance and cross-resistance profiles; (ii) reduction of drug burden by optimizing two-drug or three-drug combinations; and (iii) improvement of patient adherence by novel long-acting formulations with weekly or monthly administration. Overall, NNRTIs play an important role in the management of HIV-1 infections, especially in resource-limited countries.";https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17425255.2019.1673367;5.7;5.9;6.4;;31556749;;;;

Results: In total, 22 (29.2%) children experienced treatment failure. The most common primary antiretroviral regimen was Zidovudine (AZT)/Lamivudine (3TC)/Nevirapine (NVP) (59.2%), followed by AZT/3TC/Efavirenz (EFV) (29.6%). The highest rate of virologic failure was related to the AZT/3TC/NVP regimen (68.2%). In children who used NVP, the virologic failure was significantly higher than in children on other regimens (P = 0.02). Conclusions: The present study showed that patients receiving ART regimens based on reverse transcriptase non-nucleoside inhibitors, especially NVP, experienced more treatment failure than patients receiving other regimens.;https://sites.kowsarpub.com/apid/articles/80318.html;1.0;1.2;1.3;;;e80318;;;

Clinical Pharmacology in Drug Development published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of The American College of Clinical PharmacologyA fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet of ertugliflozin, a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, and sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, was developed for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Four studies were conducted under fasted conditions to demonstrate bioequivalence of ertugliflozin/sitagliptin FDC tablets and individual components at respective strengths when coadministered in healthy subjects. All studies had open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-sequence, single-dose crossover designs. In each study 18 or 19 subjects were enrolled and received an ertugliflozin/sitagliptin FDC tablet (5 mg/50 mg, 5 mg/100 mg, 15 mg/50 mg, or 15 mg/100 mg) and corresponding strengths of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin coadministered as individual components. For both ertugliflozin and sitagliptin, the 90%CIs for the ratio (FDC:coadministration) of geometric means for area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 extrapolated to infinite time, and maximum observed plasma concentration, were within acceptance criteria for bioequivalence (80% to 125%). All adverse events were mild in intensity. The 4 studies demonstrated that each strength of FDC tablet is bioequivalent to the respective dose of coadministered individual components. This indicates that the known efficacy and tolerability of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin when coadministered can be translated to the use of a FDC formulation.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpdd.722;2.4;3.0;3.2;;31219248;;;;

Methodology: A cross sectional study was conducted to 130 adult patients with HIV/AIDS who received antiretroviral therapy for at least a month. Patients who were willing to participate were interviewed. Data was analyzed using chi-square test (p<0.05). Results: Overall  95% adherence of the last month was 72,6%. Adherence was associated with male gender (p=0,042), lower duration of therapy (p=0,042), no smoking habits (p= 0,016) and the distances to health facilities (p=0,004). Multivariate analysis show that distances to health facilities are the most influential factor on the ART medication adherence (p = 0.007) with OR = 5.651.Young age, high level of education, spouse (marital status), good financial status, taking alcohol habits, health insurance coverage, not experiencing adverse drug reactions, and support from family, spouse or friend were not associated with high adherence to ARV therapy.

We report safety outcomes of pregnant women who initiated ART through Option B+. Methods: We analysed 12-month data from an observational cohort study on Option B+ among women newly initiating tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz (TDF/3TC/EFV) at a government antenatal clinic in Lilongwe, Malawi. Proportions of women engaged in care, incidence of DAIDS grade  2 laboratory toxicity, grade  3 adverse events (AEs), viral suppression (<1000 copies/mL), birth outcomes and infant HIV infections are reported. Results: At ART initiation, participants (n = 299) had a median age of 26 years (IQR 22–30), median CD4 count of 352 cells/l (IQR 231–520) and 94% were in WHO Stage 1. We noted 76 incident DAIDS Grade  2 laboratory results among 58 women, most commonly elevated liver function tests (n = 30 events) and low haemoglobin (n = 27). No women had elevated creatinine. Clinical AEs (n = 45) were predominantly infectious diseases and Grade 3. Five participants (2%) discontinued TDF/3TC/EFV due to virologic failure (3) or toxicity (2). Twelve months after ART initiation, most women were engaged in care (89%) and had HIV RNA < 1000 copies/ml (90%). 8% of pregnancies resulted in preterm birth, 9% were low birthweight (<2500 g), and 2% resulted in infant HIV infection at 6 weeks post-delivery. Conclusion: Most women remained on ART and were virally suppressed 12 months after starting Option B+. Few infants contracted HIV perinatally. While some women experienced adverse laboratory events, clinical symptom monitoring is likely reasonable.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tmi.13296;5.3;4.7;4.5;;31381233;;;;

Although oral fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) are available, parenteral administration may be clinically justified. The goal of this study was to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of an intravenous FDC of ibuprofen and acetaminophen after bunionectomy. Methods: This study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled factorial clinical trial conducted at 2 clinical research centers in the United States between November 2016 and June 2017. Eligible patients (male and female subjects, aged 18–65 years, reporting pain intensity levels 40 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) after distal, first metatarsal bunionectomy) were randomized (3:3:3:2) to receive the FDC (ibuprofen 300 mg + acetaminophen 1000 mg), ibuprofen 300 mg, acetaminophen 1000 mg, or placebo (vehicle), administered as 15-minute intravenous infusions every 6 hours for 48 hours. The primary efficacy end point was the time-adjusted sum of pain intensity differences from baseline over 48 hours (SPID48). In addition to VAS pain intensity scores, pain relief scores, time to perceptible and meaningful pain relief, the use of rescue medication, and participant's global evaluations of the study drug were recorded. Adverse events occurring during the 48-hour treatment period were included in the safety analysis. Findings: A total of 276 participants were enrolled; most were female (82%), the mean age was 42.4 years, and the median baseline VAS was 67 mm, indicating moderate to severe pain. SPID48 was significantly higher for the FDC (23.4 [2.5] mm) than for ibuprofen (9.5 [2.5] mm), acetaminophen (10.4 [2.5] mm), and placebo (1.3 [3.1] mm; all, P < 0.001). The superior analgesic effect of the FDC was supported by a range of secondary end points, including reduced opioid usage rates (75% for FDC, 92% for ibuprofen, 93% for acetaminophen, and 96% for placebo; all, P < 0.005). The safety profile of the FDC was comparable to that of intravenous ibuprofen or acetaminophen alone. Three participants withdrew from the study due to adverse events: 2 in the ibuprofen group and 1 in the acetaminophen group. Implications: The study found that repeated administration of an intravenous FDC of ibuprofen and acetaminophen provided statistically significant improvement in SPID48 over comparable doses of either monotherapy without an increase in adverse events.

Limited studies, however, have been conducted on the incidence of renal impairment among Chinese patients with long-term exposure to TDF-containing ART regimens. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 269 eligible patients who had no comorbidities and received TDF-containing ART from July 2014 to April 2015. TDF-related renal impairment was defined as a decrease of eGFR by >25% from baseline or eGFR <90 ml/min/1.73 m2. Decreased renal function was defined as a decrease of eGFR by > 10 mL/min/1.73 m2 from baseline. Results: 97.0% of study patients were male (median age 29, eGFR 124.0 ml/min/1.73 m2). After 168-week of ART, renal impairment occurred in 7 patients (2.7%). The incidence of decreased renal function was significantly higher at Week 168 compared with that observed at Week 12 (24.8% vs 3.7%, p < 0.001). In generalized estimating equation analysis, patients receiving ART for 144-week (aOR4.1, 95%CI 2.0–8.4) and 168-week (aOR8.4, 95%CI 4.2–16.4) were more likely to develop decreased renal function compared with those receiving ART for 12-week, so were the patients with a weight <58 kg (aOR2.3, 95%CI 1.2–4.3) and 58–66 kg (aOR2.0, 95%CI 1.0–3.8) compared to those with a weight 67 kg. At 168-week, 41.0% of 100 patients examined had elevated urine 2-microglobulin levels, which were negatively correlated with eGFR (r = 0.22, p = 0.02). Conclusions: TDF-related renal impairment remained rare in HIV-positive Chinese patients with a median age of 29 years who had no comorbidities. A lower weight and duration of ART were associated with decreased renal function.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1684118219300878;3.9;4.3;4.8;S1684118219300878;31427111;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1684118219300878;;

Within 2 years of therapy, 29 (10.2%) participants experienced HBV functional cure (confirmed loss of hepatitis B surface antigen). In multivariable analysis, baseline CD4 count <350 cells/mm3, female sex, and lower baseline HBV deoxyribonucleic acid were associated with increased odds of functional cure.

Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional survey with a two-stage cluster sampling was conducted from March to November 2016. Nineteen of 45 total ART clinics representing >90% of the national cohort of adults on ART were included. ART initiators were defined as PLHIV initiating or reinitiating first-line ART. HIVDR was assessed for protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase Sanger sequences using the Stanford HIVdb algorithm. Viral load (VL) suppression was defined as <1000 copies/mL. Results were weighted according to the survey design. Results and discussion: A total of 638 participants were enrolled (PDR: 171; ADR12: 114; ADR48: 353). The proportion of ART initiators with prior exposure to antiretrovirals (ARVs) was 12.3% (95% CI: 5.8% to 24.3%). PDR prevalence to any drug was 23.4% (95% CI: 14.4% to 35.6%), and 19.3% (95% CI: 12.2% to 29.1%) to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). NNRTI PDR was higher in ART initiators with previous ARV exposure compared with those with no exposure (76.2% vs. 11.0%, p < 0.001). Protease inhibitors (PI) and integrase strand transfer inhibitors PDR was not observed. VL suppression rate was 77.8% (95% CI: 67.1% to 85.8%) in ADR12 and 70.3% (95% CI: 66.7% to 73.8%) in ADR48. ADR12 prevalence to any drug among PLHIV without VL suppression was 85.1% (95% CI: 66.1% to 94.4%), 82.4% to NNRTI and 70.2% to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). ADR48 prevalence to any drug among PLHIV without VL suppression was 75.5% (95% CI: 63.5% to 84.5 %), 70.7% to NNRTI, 59.4% to NRTI and 4.6% to PI. Conclusions: Despite implementation challenges yielding low-precision HIVDR estimates, high rates of NNRTI PDR were observed in Nicaragua, suggesting consideration of non-NNRTI-based first-line regimens for ART initiators. Strengthened HIVDR monitoring, systematic VL testing, and improved ART adherence support are also warranted.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jia2.25429;5.5;6.7;7.1;;31860167;e25429;;;

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Infectious Diseases Society of America.Objective: We evaluated trends and population effectiveness (tolerability, HIV suppression) of current combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimens mindful of treatment guidelines. Method: Trend analyses included 18 017 person-visits (1457 men) on cART during 2008-2017 in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. Effectiveness analyses of current regimens used 3598 person-visit-pairs (745 men) on cART in 2014-2017. Inverse-probability-of-treatment-and-censoring weighted Poisson regression with robust variances was used to evaluate the association between regimens and switching, adherence and HIV RNA <20 copies/mL. Results: Integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based regimen usage has increased since 2008. Almost 90% of cART initiators started with INSTI-cART in 2016-2017; cART adherence was stable around 90% and 83%-85% suppressed virus (<20 cp/mL). Commonly used regimens in 2014-2017 contained disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) backbone with efavirenz (EFV, n = 1161 person-visits), elvitegravir/cobicistat (EVG/c, n = 551), rilpivirine (RPV, n = 492), darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r, n = 351), or atazanavir (ATV)/r (n = 333). Others were dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (DTG/ABC/3TC, n = 401) and EVG/c/tenofovir alafenamide/FTC (EVG/c/TAF/FTC, n = 309). Compared to EFV/TDF/FTC users, ATV/r+TDF/FTC users switched more (rate ratio [RR] = 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17-2.76), while those on DTG/ABC/3TC (RR [95% CI] = 0.16 [0.08-0.31]) or EVG/c/TAF/FTC (RR [95% CI] = 0.12 [0.06-0.27]) switched less. The rate of suppressed HIV RNA was 15% (95% CI, 2%-26%) lower among younger EVG/c/TDF/FTC users and 18% (95% CI, 3%-34%) higher in older DRV/r+TDF/FTC users; adherence did not differ by regimen.

This is of particular importance among women living in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding this relationship could help elucidate if and how the host immune system interacts with the vaginal microbiome. Methods: The vaginal microbiome of HIV-1/HSV-2-coinfected women (n = 92) in Uganda was evaluated from self-collected vaginal swabs 1 month pre-ART and at 4 and 6 months post-ART initiation. The vaginal microbiome was characterized by 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Vaginal community state types (CSTs) were identified using proportional abundance data. Changes in microbiome composition were assessed with permutational analyses of variance (PerMANOVA). Results: Five vaginal CSTs were identified, which varied significantly by bacterial load (P <. 01): CST-1 was characterized by Lactobacillus iners, CST-2 by Gardnerella, CST-3 by Gardnerella and Prevotella, CST-4 by Lactobacillus crispatus, and CST-5 was highly diverse. Vaginal microbiome composition also did not change significantly after ART initiation (P =. 985). Immune reconstitution after ART initiation did not affect vaginal microbiome CST assignment (P =. 722) or individual-level changes in bacterial load (log response ratio [interquartile range],-0.50 [-2.75 to 0.38] vs-0.29 [-2.03 to 1.42]; P =. 40). Conclusions: The vaginal microbiome of HIV-infected women was not affected by the initiation of ART or immune reconstitution in this observational study. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of ART treatment on the vaginal microbiome.";https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofz328/5532035;3.5;4.6;3.8;;;ofz328;;;

Atovaquone-proguanil (AP), a safe, effective treatment for multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum (P.f.), previously demonstrated additive effects in combination with artesunate (AS). Methods: Patients with P.f. or mixed-species infection (n = 205) in Anlong Veng (AV; n = 157) and Kratie (KT; n = 48), Cambodia, were randomized open-label 1:1 to a fixed-dose 3-day AP regimen +/-3 days of co-administered artesunate (ASAP). Single low-dose primaquine (PQ, 15 mg) was given on day 1 to prevent gametocyte-mediated transmission. Results: Polymerase chain reaction-adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological response at 42 days was 90% for AP (95% confidence interval [CI], 82%-95%) and 92% for ASAP (95% CI, 83%-96%; P =. 73). The median parasite clearance time was 72 hours for ASAP in AV vs 56 hours in KT (P <. 001) and was no different than AP alone. At 1 week postprimaquine, 7% of the ASAP group carried microscopic gametocytes vs 29% for AP alone (P =. 0001). Nearly all P.f. isolates had C580Y K13 propeller artemisinin resistance mutations (AV 99%; KT 88%). Only 1 of 14 treatment failures carried the cytochrome bc1 (Pfcytb) atovaquone resistance mutation, which was not present at baseline. P.f. isolates remained atovaquone sensitive in vitro but cycloguanil resistant, with a triple P.f. dihydrofolate reductase mutation. Conclusions: Atovaquone-proguanil remained marginally effective in Cambodia (90%) with minimal Pfcytb mutations observed. Treatment failures in the presence of ex vivo atovaquone sensitivity and adequate plasma levels may be attributable to cycloguanil and/or artemisinin resistance. Artesunate co-administration provided little additional blood-stage efficacy but reduced post-treatment gametocyte carriage in combination with AP beyond single low-dose primaquine.";https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofz314/5560073;3.5;4.6;3.8;;;ofz314;;;

FDCs have been drawing attention from the pharmaceutical industries because of the government’s ban on 328 irrational FDCs in September 2018. The Drug Technical Advisory Board (DTAB) recommended that ‘there is no therapeutic justification’ for the active ingredients in the banned FDCs and accordingly these combinations ‘may involve a risk to human beings’. Areas covered: The review illustrates the present status of FDCs, its regulatory framework, approvals in India and discusses the substantive cause behind the ban on FDCs in India. Expert opinion: The expert stress to establish a robust regulatory system for the approval of FDCs in India. The pharmaceutical industries should not perceive the ban against irrational FDCs as an impediment; rather, they should view as an opportunity to establish a stronger healthcare system. The current review is an eye-opener for the section of people who consider that the ban on FDCs is irrational. However, the ban on 328 FDCs may prove a landmark decision for the development of stronger healthcare policy in India.";https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14740338.2019.1651292;6.3;6.3;6.2;;31374180;;;;

The analysis uses soil hydrological properties, soil moisture storage capacity and the predominant runoff generation mechanism. The results show that MM_FDC did not distinguish the shapes of the upper and lower thirds of the FDC. The upper third is where the precipitation pattern and the antecedent moisture conditions are dominant, while the lower third is where drought-induced low flows and the evapotranspiration effect are prevalent. It is possible to use the MM_FDC to predict the middle third of the FDC (exceedence probabilities between 33% and 66%). The method is constrained by the catchment flow variability (slope of FDC), which changes in accordance with landscape properties and the predominant runoff generation mechanism.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02626667.2019.1657233;3.7;4.2;4.7;;;;;;

Methods: A static budget impact model was developed to assess the impact of budesonide/formoterol FDC entry on HIO budget over a 3-year period in Egyptian settings. Direct medical costs, including the costs of asthma medications, exacerbations, and management of side-effects, were obtained from HIO cost data. Population data were obtained from the World Bank and supplemented with local studies, and the rates of exacerbations, adverse effects, and number of sick leave days were elicited from the SYGMA 1 trial. Scenario analyses from a societal perspective and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: The total costs (drug and non-drug costs) for managing mild asthma patients from the HIO perspective were estimated to be EGP8.563 billion before budesonide/formoterol entry compared to EGP5.525 billion post-entry, leading to a total budget savings of EGP3.038 billion after 3 years. This total budget saving included an increase in drug costs (EGP104 million) and a decrease in non-drug costs (EGP3.143 billion). Drug costs were higher in the budesonide/formoterol group than in the salbutamol group, but this cost was offset by reductions in non-drug costs, resulting in a reduction in the total costs of healthcare resources. At the societal level, the total budget savings after including the indirect costs was expected to be EGP5.976 billion after 3 years of budesonide/formoterol entry. Conclusion: Budesonide/formoterol in mild asthma instead of salbutamol produces better patient outcomes and decreases total costs, with increases in drug cost offset by reductions in non-drug costs due to fewer exacerbations. Budesonide/formoterol is a budget saving option for guideline-directed treatment, from the economic perspective of the payer and the health perspective of the patient.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13696998.2019.1642899;3.5;3.3;3.3;;31298593;;;;

The goal of this study was the development of a supersaturating drug delivery system containing sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim at fixed dose combination (sulfamethoxazole:trimethoprim 5:1 w/w). Methods: The amorphous solid dispersions were formed at three different proportions containing 30, 50 and 70% of Eudragit EPO in the formulation. Results: The supersaturation state is formed by the amorphous drugs produced by spray drying technique, and the maintenance of this state is due to the chemical interactions between the drugs and the polymer selected, which was observed in the fluorescence interaction studies realized between the drugs and the polymer. The Formulation containing 70% of the polymer was able to produce and maintain the supersaturated state of both drugs for 24 h. Solid state characterization demonstrated the amorphization of the drugs in the solid dispersion and indicated the hydrogen bond formation responsible for the improvement in the apparent solubility. This formulation presented an improved antibacterial activity when compared to the combination of the drugs. Conclusion: For the first time, a supersaturating drug delivery system was developed to the complementary antibacterial drugs. This ternary formulation is a powerful alternative to improve oral absorption of recognized safety drugs, reducing the dose and consequently the antibiotic resistance emergence.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14787210.2019.1675508;5.7;5.6;5.4;;31577912;;;;

Classically, the rescue medication recommended comprised short-acting  agonists (SABA). Some years ago, the use of Symbicort Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (SMART) demonstrated the benefits of a combination of budesonide-formoterol, an inhaled corticosteroid, and a long-acting  agonist (ICS-LABA) as rescue medication in moderate and severe asthma. The results were enthusiastically received, and this therapeutic option was adopted in the guidelines for moderate to severe asthma patients. Recently, four trials (two randomised placebo control trials under the auspices of the SYGMA project and two real-life studies, Novel START, and the PRACTICAL trial) have explored the potential benefits of substituting SABA with budesonide-formoterol as rescue medication in mild asthma patients. The SYGMA 1 and 2 studies showed that the combination with formoterol-budesonide as rescue medication provides better asthma control than short-acting -agonists alone in GINA step 2 patients, although the superiority was slight. Compared to budesonide maintenance therapy, the fixed combination of ICS-LABA on demand provides poorer asthma control. Regarding exacerbations, the fixed dose ICS-LABA combination on demand showed the same benefits for the prevention of exacerbations as chronic ICS treatment in mild asthma patients. The Novel START study, which assessed a population with milder symptoms, concluded that the fixed dose ICS-LABA combination used as needed was superior to SABA (albuterol) as needed for the prevention of asthma exacerbations. These results in fact show that, in undertreated GINA step 2 with only SABA as needed, ICS-LABA is more effective than SABA. The authors of PRACTICAL concluded that the study provided modest evidence that the ICS-LABA combination used as-needed for symptom relief reduces the rate of severe exacerbations compared with maintenance low-dose budesonide plus terbutaline as needed, although the study was not limited to mild asthma since according to the treatment consumed, it was evident that they had recruited some moderate asthma patients. Despite this poor evidence, and ignoring the clinical histological benefits of chronic inhaled corticosteroids (especially when administered promptly), GINA 2019 recently recommended daily low dose ICS or ICS-LABA as needed as a first option for step 2 patients. For step 1, symptom-driven or as-needed treatment with ICS-LABA is recommended rather than SABA alone (the preferred option until the last GINA update). Finally, the SIENA study showed that 73% of patients with mild asthma do not have an eosinophilic phenotype and that these patients have a similar clinical response to ICS (mometasone) and antimuscarinic drugs (tiotropium), results that challenge the indication of a drug combination that incorporates ICS as a first option. Overall, we believe there is insufficient evidence for the systematic recommendation of as-needed ICS-LABA instead of SABA on request for GINA step 1 or as a replacement for chronic ICS in GINA step 2.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40265-019-01202-0;9.4;9.2;9.6;;31584145;;;;

Fixed-dose combinations of OTC with DICLO or PIRO, available as extended release injectable solutions, are widely indicated for animal use. These drugs were subject to forced degradation (alkaline, acid, neutral, oxidative photolytic conditions) as per ICH Q1 (R2) guideline and the kinetic of degradation reactions was investigated. OTC showed higher degradation under neutral, oxidative, alkaline and acid conditions and DICLO showed extensive photo degradation, while PIRO was the most stable drug under all degradation conditions studied. A total of seven degradation products (DPs) were observed and efficient chromatographic separations of drugs and their DPs were achieved on an InertSustain C8 column using a mobile phase composed by methanol-acetonitrile-water (40:35:25, v/v/v) at pH 2.5, adjusted with formic acid, in isocratic mode. Six DPs were isolated by HPLC-PDA and their chemical structures were proposed based on high resolution MS and MS/MS data. DP 1 to DP 5 had OTC as precursor drug, while DP 6 originated from DICLO photolysis. The chemical structures of DP 1, DP 4 and DP 5 are being reported here for the first time.

However, control over antigen retention has been limited. Here we discovered that antigen conjugated to nanoparticle carriers of different sizes impacts the intralymph node transport and specific cell interaction. We found that follicular dendritic cell (FDC) networks determine the intralymph node follicle fate of these nanoparticles by clearing smaller ones (5-15 nm) within 48 h and retaining larger ones (50-100 nm) for over 5 weeks. The 50-100 nm-sized nanoparticles had 175-fold more delivery of antigen at the FDC dendrites, 5-fold enhanced humoral immune responses of germinal center B cell formation, and 5-fold more antigen-specific antibody production over 5-15 nm nanoparticles. Our results show that we can tune humoral immunity by simply manipulating the carrier size design to produce effectiveness of vaccines.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b02834;22.4;21.2;20.5;;31508968;;;;

In this article, we discuss the different modalities and effects of combination therapy and possible future research questions. Treatment with a single antihypertensive agent can effectively reduce blood pressure in only a limited number of patients, while most require therapy with two or more agents to achieve target levels. As initial therapy, American and European guidelines suggest a combination of two antihypertensive drugs and the use of a third antihypertensive drug when hypertension is still uncontrolled. Initial combination therapy is recommended in high-risk patients for an immediate blood pressure response, improved tolerability and possibly increased patient adherence. In addition to the potential benefits of combining different drug classes with synergistic pharmacological and physiological actions, this approach is useful for increasing the patient compliance with treatment, in particular if provided at fixed doses in a single pill. The minimisation of side effects is critical for the long-term treatment of a largely asymptomatic condition such as systemic hypertension. Low-dose combinations of different drugs from classes with complementary actions may provide the best ratio of lower side effects and improved tolerability with a significant blood pressure reduction, particularly in high-risk patients. This approach could be aided by a multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention on risk factors.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40265-019-01209-7;9.4;9.2;9.6;;31602564;;;;

CPS is an integrated system that combines computing, sensors and actuators. CPS is controlled by computer-based algorithms that integrates people and internet. However, the performance of CPS is limited by its computational complexity. How to implement CPS with less computational complexity in a real time performance remains an important issue. Therefore, the study attempts to establish a CPS based on machine learning to reduce its complexity and improve applicability. This study applies a Fault Detection and Classification system (FDC) with machine learning method in the virtual subsystem of CPS. This study consists of two steps. Based on the data collected from sensors of CPS, Random Forest (RF) is used to figure out key factors that reduces the data dimension for less computational complexity. The process engineers will know which factors are causing the machine fails. The second step is to establish a time series model which bases on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to achieve real time monitoring of the machine. Before the machine fails, FDC will alarm that allow the engineer to adjust parameters of machines to avoid machine fails. The study in order to achieve the goals of predicting machines fails, figuring out key factors, predicting maintenance and increasing the productivity.;https://www.medra.org/servlet/aliasResolver?alias=iospressISBN&isbn=978-1-64368-020-0&spage=519&doi=10.3233/ATDE190159;0;0;0;;;;;true;9781614994398

All rights reserved.Background:Bictegravir, coformulated with emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide as a fixed-dose combination (B/F/TAF), is recommended for treatment of HIV-1-infection. Multiple studies of B/F/TAF in treatment-naive and virologically suppressed cohorts have shown high efficacy and tolerability with no treatment-emergent resistance through 48 weeks. Participants in these studies have been predominantly men. We report 48-week results from a phase 3 study evaluating switching to B/F/TAF, specifically in a globally distributed trial population of women.Methods:In this multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, noninferiority trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02652624), women living with HIV who were virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA levels <50 copies/mL) on a regimen containing either TAF or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were randomly assigned (1:1) to switch to B/F/TAF (50/200/25 mg) or stay on baseline regimen (SBR) once daily for 48 weeks. Primary endpoint was proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA 50 copies/mL at week 48 (U.S. Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm); prespecified noninferiority margin was 4%.Findings:We randomized 472 participants and treated 470 (234 B/F/TAF, 236 SBR). Switching to B/F/TAF was noninferior to SBR for the primary outcome, as 1.7% (4/234) vs 1.7% (4/236) had HIV-1 RNA 50 copies/mL at week 48 (difference 0.0%, 95.001% confidence interval: -2.9% to 2.9%). No individual receiving B/F/TAF developed treatment-emergent resistance. Both treatments were well-tolerated; no participant discontinued treatment because of an adverse event.Interpretation:Fixed-dose combination B/F/TAF provides a safe and efficacious option for ongoing treatment of HIV in women. This study contributes important data on safety, tolerability, and outcomes of antiretroviral therapy among women living with HIV.";http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201911010-00013;6.9;7.0;6.4;;31609930;;;;

METHOD All HIV/HCV co-infected patients attending the HIV unit of the “Laiko” University Hospital in Athens, Greece, from 1.1.2015 to 31.12.2017 were screened for this study. Inclusion criteria were HIV/HCV co-infection and age 18–85 years. A diagnosis of poor prognosis cancer was an exclusion criterion. Transient elastography (TE) was performed at study entry and laboratory tests were conducted at baseline and every 3 months until the end of follow up. HCV treatment was administered according to national guidelines. All the patients were followed up for 6 months after sustained virological response (SVR) and treatment-related and HIV-related complications were noted. RESULTS A total of 28 patients with HIV/HCV coinfection were treated during the study period, 25 of which were male. Abnormal serum levels of transaminases were recorded in 21 patients at study entry. The median TE value was 7.6 kilopaskal (KPa), with 11 patients being classified as Metavir F0–F1 fibrosis, 6 F2, 8 F3 and 3 F4 according to TE. Thirteen patients had HCV genotype 1, 7 genotype 3, 4 genotype 2 and 4 genotype 4. Stage C HIV infection according to CDC staging was identified in 5 patients. SVR for HCV infection was achieved in 26 of the 28 patients treated (93%). Before the initiation of DAAs, 9 patients required a change in HIV-antiretroviral treatment (ARV), due to drug-drug interactions. No patient had a worsening of HIV-related serum markers during HCV-treatment and follow up. CONCLUSIONS DAAs treatment in HIV/HCV co-infected patients results in high SVR rates, with no significant side effects. ARV modification, when needed, allows HCV eradication with no adverse HIV-related effects.;None;0.1;0.1;0.1;;;;;;

Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) is one predictor for the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVDs) and mortality. We evaluated the prevalence and risk factors related to carotid atherosclerosis among well-suppressed HIV-infected adults receiving long-term ART from Thailand. This was a cross-sectional study of HIV-infected adults >50 years of age and free from CVDs from Thailand during 1 March 2016 and 30 May 2017. Ultrasonography of the carotid was performed and read by cIMT experienced neurologists who were blinded from the patient care. Subclinical atherosclerosis was defined by carotid plaque or cIMT of the common carotid artery (CCA) >0.9 mm. Totally 316 HIV-infected adults (61% males) were included. Median age was 54.4 years and 15.8% were diabetic, 40.2% had hypertension, and 12.7% were current smokers. The median duration of ART was 16.3 years and 32% were currently on boosted protease inhibitor. The mean overall cIMT of the common carotid arteries were 0.63 (IQR 0.55-0.72) mm. Men had higher cIMT than women, 0.64 (IQR 0.56-0.76) vs. 0.60 (IQR 0.53-0.70), p = .03. Overall, 3.8% had cIMT >0.9 mm and 24.4% had carotid plaque. From the multivariate logistic regression analysis, age per 1 year increase [odds ratio (OR) 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.003-1.12; p = .04] and nadir CD4 < 200 cells/mm3 (OR 1.8; 95%CI 1.02-3.18, p = .04) were significantly associated with subclinical atherosclerosis. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was not associated with subclinical atherosclerosis. In this well-suppressed HIV-infected Aging Asian cohort with relatively low prevalence of current smokers, 26.9% of them had subclinical atherosclerosis. Advanced age and low nadir CD4 cell count were significantly associated with subclinical atherosclerosis. Given that approximately a quarter of the patients had carotid plaques, longitudinal studies to evaluate the development of future overt coronary artery disease and stroke are warranted.";https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2019.0126;3.3;3.2;3.4;;31530175;;;;

The introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has changed dramatically the outcome of HCV treatment. In spite of the Food and Drug Administration approval of the oral drugs sofosbuvir (SOF) and ledipasvir (LED) for the treatment of HCV in adolescents more than or equal to 12 years old, sufficient real-world experience is still lacking. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the generic SOF/LED fixed-dose combination 400/90 (400 mg SOF + 90 mg LED) for the treatment of adolescents and children (9–12 years) with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Methods: In this prospective observational study, 100 cases of genotype 4 CHC were recruited consecutively from those fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All cases received the generic fixed-dose combination SOF/LED (400/90), one tablet daily for 12 weeks. All clinical, laboratory, and virologic characteristics were evaluated at base line, and week (W) 2, 4, 8, and 12 of therapy and W12 post-treatment (SVR12). Results: Recruited children (9–12) and adolescents weighed 28–83 and 31–90 kg, respectively. Eighty cases were naïve and 20 cases were pegylated interferon/ribavirin treatment-experienced. Very rapid virologic response (vRVR) at W2 was 96%, while at W4 response rate was 100% and maintained till the end of treatment and at W12 post-treatment (SVR12). All reported side effects were mild and did not lead to treatment termination and disappeared at W12 post-treatment. Conclusion: The generic SOF/LED fixed-dose combination is safe and effective in children, 9–12 years, and adolescents with vRVR rate of 96%, 100% EOT response and SVR12.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12072-019-09985-w;4.0;5.3;5.8;;31515739;;;;

Here, we report HIV-1 genetic diversity and DRMs in blood samples from 42 HIV-positive pregnant women naive to antiretroviral therapy (ART), in Luanda. The samples were subjected to nested-PCR, followed by sequencing of HIV-1 pol gene, targeting the protease and reverse transcriptase fragments. HIV-1 diversity was analyzed using the REGA HIV-1 subtyping tool and DRMs were identified using the Calibrated Population Resistance tool. A total of 34 sequences were obtained. The data revealed wide HIV-1 subtypes heterogeneity, with subtype C (38%, 13/34) the most frequent, followed by the subtypes F1 (18%, 6/34), A1 (9%, 3/34), G (9%, 3/34), D (6%, 2/34) and H (3%, 1/34). In addition, recombinants strains were detected, with CRF02_AG (6%, 2/34) the most frequent, followed by CRF37_cpx, F1/C, A1/G and H/G, all with 3% (1/34). A total of 6/34 (18%) of the sequences presented DRMs. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors presented 15% (5/34) of resistance. Moreover, 1/34 (3%) sequence presented resistance against both non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, simultaneously. Despite the small sample size, our results suggest the need to update currently used ART regimens. Surveillance of HIV-1 subtypes and DRMs are necessary to understand HIV epidemiology and to guide modification of ART guidelines in Angola.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225251;5.7;5.4;5.2;;31770425;e0225251;;;

A characterization through Raman spectrum and optical absorption of the glass host was first performed, followed by optical absorption and excitation spectra of the Tm3+/Dy3+ doped glass samples. Multi-wavelength light emission was observed in the blue (455 and 480 nm), yellow (580 nm), red (655 nm), and NIR (750, 800, 1400, and 1600 nm) regions, generated via up- or down-conversion, exploiting either NIR (1000–1240 nm) or UV (355 nm) excitation sources, respectively. The excitation routes of both FUC and FDC were proposed. The quasi-resonant overlap of Tm3+ and Dy3+ absorption, excitation, and luminescence spectra in the NIR and UV-VIS spectral regions led to efficient Tm3+-to-Dy3+ energy-transfer processes (Tm3+ [3F4] + Dy3+ [6H15/2]  Tm3+ [3H6] + Dy3+ [6H11/2], Tm3+ [1G4] + Dy3+ [6H15/2]  Tm3+ [3H6] + Dy3+ [4F9/2], and Tm3+ [3H4] + Dy3+ [6H15/2]  Tm3+ [3H6] + Dy3+ [6F5/2]). Time resolve fluorescence confirm Tm3+ ions as donors in the energy-transfer mechanism. The dependence of the luminescence and efficiency of the energy-transfer process upon concentration was evaluated using conventional rate equations.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022231319311160;5.0;4.8;5.5;S0022231319311160;;116706;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0022231319311160;;

We aim to characterize changes in BMI over time on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and investigate the association between weight gain and survival in South Africa.Design and methods:A prospective cohort study among HIV-positive adults on first-line ART between April 2004 and 2015 in Johannesburg, South Africa. We used latent-class growth modelling (adjusted for age, sex and CD4+ cell count) to identify groups of individuals with similar patterns of change in BMI over time.Results:Eleven thousand, two hundred and sixty-three patients were included. The best fit model involved two linear and two quadratic trajectories. Thirty-five percent of patients were categorized into group one (mean BMI at ART initiation, 20.4 kg/m2; mean BMI after 8 years of follow-up, 20.9 kg/m2), 38% into group two (24.5-26.2 kg/m2), 21% into group three (29.5-32.6 kg/m2) and 6% into group four (36.5-40.0 kg/m2). Over the 8 years of follow-up, 6% of our cohort went down in BMI standard category, while 45% went up. The largest increase occurred in the first 12 months on ART. In years 2 through 8, we saw a more gradual increase in BMI.Conclusion:The largest gain in BMI in HIV patients occurred in the first year on ART.

In this study, we used a standardised algorithm including a wide range of adherence-enhancing interventions followed by a new viral load measurement to decide whether to switch to third-line therapy in this situation. The decision, made on the basis of effectiveness of the adherence reinforcement to drive viral resuppression, did not use genotypic resistance testing. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, adults in four west African countries with treatment failure of a boosted protease inhibitor ART regimen were offered nine adherence reinforcement interventions, and followed up for 64 weeks. We measured viral load at week 12 and used the results to decide ART treatment at week 16: if successful resuppression (plasma HIV-1 RNA <400 copies per mL or had decreased by 2 log10 copies per mL compared with baseline), patients continued the same second-line regimen; otherwise they switched to a third-line regimen based on ritonavir-boosted darunavir and raltegravir. The primary endpoint was virological success at week 64 (plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL). After study termination we did genotypic resistance testing on frozen plasma samples collected at baseline, and retrospectively determined the appropriateness of the week 16 decision on the basis of the baseline genotypic susceptibility score. Findings: Between March 28, 2013, and May 11, 2015, of the 198 eligible participants, five died before week 16. Of the 193 remaining, 130 (67%) reached viral resuppression and continued with second-line ART, and 63 (33%) switched to third-line ART at week 16. Post-study genotypic resistance testing showed that the baseline genotypic susceptibility score was calculable in 166 patients, of whom 57 (34%) had a score less than 2. We retrospectively concluded that the week 16 decision was appropriate in 145 (75%) patients. At week 64, four patients (2%) were lost to follow-up, ten (5%) had died, and 101 (52%) had a viral load less than 50 copies per mL. Interpretation: Poor adherence is the first problem to tackle in patients for whom second-line ART is failing when resistance tests are not routinely available and is effectively a manageable problem.

However, it is unable to impact on viral reservoirs, which harbour latent HIV-1 genomes that are able to reignite the infection upon treatment suspension. The aim of this study was to provide an estimate of the safety of the disease-modifying antirheumatic agent auranofin and its impact on the HIV-1 reservoir in humans under intensified ART. For this purpose, an interim analysis was conducted of three of the six arms of the NCT02961829 clinical trial (five patients each) with: no intervention, i.e. continuation of first-line ART; intensified ART (ART + dolutegravir and maraviroc); and intensified ART plus auranofin. Auranofin treatment was found to be well tolerated. No major adverse events were detected apart from a transient decrease in CD4+ T-cell counts at Weeks 8 and 12. Auranofin decreased total viral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with ART-only regimens at Week 20 (P = 0.036) and induced a decrease in integrated viral DNA as quantified by Alu PCR. Despite the limited number of patient-derived sequences available in this study, phylogenetic analyses of nef sequences support the idea that auranofin may impact on the viral reservoir.

Then, considering the characteristics of nonlinearity and strong coupling in the model, an FDC system that consists of two fuzzy PID controllers, a fuzzy decoupling controller, and two linear correction adjusters is presented. Finally, after the effectiveness of this method was verified by simulations, it was implemented in a real-world BF.

Methods: ART regimens were classified as recommended, alternative or nonrecommended according to the guidelines. Physicians were asked the reasons for prescribing nonrecommended regimens. Factors associated with the prescription of non recommended regimens were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results: During the study period, 586 (10.7%) of 5479 patients who started ART were given a regimen not recommended in the guidelines. The most frequent reasons for prescribing nonrecommended regimens were: enrolment in clinical trials (43.3%), comorbidities and/or interactions (10.2%), pregnancy (8.7%), and cost (7.7%). Among 37 participating centers, 16 (43%), treating 3561 patients, reported limitations related with the cost of ART, and 20 (54%), treating 1365 patients, reported restrictions for prescribing at least one recommended antiretroviral. In multivariable analysis, a higher risk of receiving nonrecommended regimens was associated with male gender, HIV acquisition by heterosexual transmission, low viral loads, initiation of treatment during the years 2011 to 2015, and initiation of treatment in a center with restricted access to at least one antiretroviral drug. Conclusions: Compliance to clinical guidelines was high. A high proportion of centres reported cost limitations for ART or restricted access to at least one recommended antiretroviral drug, with a significant impact on the choice of initial regimens.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0213005X19301429;1.8;1.7;1.7;S0213005X19301429;30982676;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0213005X19301429;;

The lopinavir/ritonavir plasma concentrations at standard doses were significantly above the recommended levels. Pharmacogenetic analysis revealed a polymorphism in the DRD3 gene associated with a decrease in the rate of drug metabolism. Additionally, the patient’s low body mass index could have contributed to a greater degree of patient exposure to the drug. After the withdrawal of tenofovir disoproxil and the establishment of individualized protease inhibitor monotherapy at reduced doses, a decrease in the intensity of adverse events was observed, while the clinical outcomes were maintained.

All rights reserved.Background:Medication classes, polypharmacy, and hazardous alcohol and illicit substance abuse may exhibit stronger associations with serious falls among persons living with HIV (PLWH) than with uninfected comparators. We investigated whether these associations differed by HIV status.Setting:Veterans Aging Cohort Study.Methods:We used a nested case-control design. Cases (N = 13,530) were those who fell. Falls were identified by external cause of injury codes and a machine-learning algorithm applied to radiology reports. Cases were matched to controls (N = 67,060) by age, race, sex, HIV status, duration of observation, and baseline date. Risk factors included medication classes, count of unique non-antiretroviral therapy (non-ART) medications, and hazardous alcohol and illicit substance use. We used unconditional logistic regression to evaluate associations.Results:Among PLWH, benzodiazepines [odds ratio (OR) 1.24; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 1.40] and muscle relaxants (OR 1.29; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.46) were associated with serious falls but not among uninfected (P > 0.05). In both groups, key risk factors included non-ART medications (per 5 medications) (OR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.23), illicit substance use/abuse (OR 1.44; 95% CI: 1.34 to 1.55), hazardous alcohol use (OR 1.30; 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.37), and an opioid prescription (OR 1.35; 95% CI: 1.29 to 1.41).Conclusion:Benzodiazepines and muscle relaxants were associated with serious falls among PLWH. Non-ART medication count, hazardous alcohol and illicit substance use, and opioid prescriptions were associated with serious falls in both groups. Prevention of serious falls should focus on reducing specific classes and absolute number of medications and both alcohol and illicit substance use.";http://journals.lww.com/00126334-201911010-00011;6.9;7.0;6.4;;31339866;;;;

WHO has provided guidelines on switching to third-line ART. In a Médecins Sans Frontières clinic in Mumbai, India, receiving referred presumptive second-line ART failure cases, an evidence-based protocol consisting of viral load (VL) testing, enhanced adherence counselling (EAC) and genotype for switching was implemented. Objective To document the outcome and genotype of presumptive second-line ART failure cases switched to third-line or maintained on second-line ART. Design Retrospective cohort study of patients referred between January 2011 and September 2017. Results The cases (n = 120) were complex with median 9.2 years of ART exposure, poor adherence at baseline, and exposure to multiple ART regimens other than recommended by WHO. Out of 90 evaluated cases, 39(43%) were maintained on second-line ART. Forty-nine (54%) were ever switched to third-line ART. Twelve months virological suppression was 72% in the second-line and 93% in the third-line ART cohort, while retention in care was 80% and 94% respectively. Genotyping showed 62% resistance for PIs, and 52% triple class resistance to NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs. Resistance was noted for the new class of integrase inhibitors, and for different drugs without any documented previous exposure to the same drug. Conclusion Adopting WHO guidelines on switching ART regimens and provision of EAC can prevent unnecessary switching/exposure to third-line ART regimens. Genotyping is urgently required in national HIV programs, which currently use only the exposure history of patients for switching to third-line ART regimens.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225631;5.7;5.4;5.2;;31751433;e0225631;;;

However, rapid scale-up of ART and the high HIV-1 genetic variability, has greatly influenced the emergence of drug-resistant strains. This constitutes a potential threat to achieving the UNAIDS’ 90-90-90 goals by 2020. We investigated the prevalent HIV-1 genotypes, drug resistance-associated mutations and assessed some predictors of the occurrence of these mutations. Methods This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study conducted between October 2010 and June 2012. Participants were consecutively enrolled from selected HIV treatment centers of the Southwest and Northwest regions of Cameroon. Viral load was determined with the automated Abbott Real-time HIV-1 m2000rt System. HIV genotyping and antiretroviral resistance mutations analysis were performed using Bayer’s HIV-1 TRUGENE™ Genotyping Kit and OpenGene DNA Sequencing system. The drug resistance mutation was interpreted with the Stanford HIV database. Epidemiological data were obtained using pretested semi-structured questionnaires. Results Of the 387 participants, 239 were successfully genotyped. The median age of these participants was 33 years (interquartile range, IQR: 28–40 years), and a majority (65.7%) were female. A total of 29.3% of the participants were receiving ART. The median duration of ART was 10.5 months (IQR: 4–17.25 months). The median CD4 count and log10 viral load of study participants were 353.5 cells/ml (IQR:145–471) and 4.89 copies/ml (IQR: 3.91–5.55) respectively. CRF02 (A/G) (69%) was the most prevalent subtype followed by G (8.2%) and F (6.7%). Overall, resistance mutations were present in 37.1% of ART-experienced and 10.7% of ART-naive patients. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) mutations occurred in 30% of ART-experienced and 2.4% of ART-naïve patients, while non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) mutations occurred in 34.2% of ART-experienced and 10.1% of -naïve patients. M184V (8.4%, 20/239) and K103N (5.4%, 13/ 239) were the most prevalent mutations. Major protease inhibitor mutations occurred in 3 (1.3%) out of the 239 sequences. The duration of ART independently predicted the occurrence of resistance mutation among ART-experienced patients. Conclusion The high resistance to NNRTIs, which are the main support to the backbone (NRTIs) first-line antiretroviral regimen in Cameroon, has prompted the need to rollout an integrase strand transfer inhibitor regimen (containing Dolutegravir) with a higher genetic barrier to resistance as the preferred first line regimen.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225575;5.7;5.4;5.2;;31751428;e0225575;;;

Our objective was to project the clinical and economic impact of integrated postpartum maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) and pediatric care in South Africa. Methods Using the CEPAC computer simulation models, parameterized with data from the Maternal and Child Health–Antiretroviral Therapy (MCH-ART) randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of integrated postpartum care for women initiating ART in pregnancy and their children. We compared two strategies: 1) standard of care (SOC) referral to local clinics after delivery for separate standard ART services for women and pediatric care for infants, and 2) the MCH-ART intervention (MCH-ART) of co-located maternal/pediatric care integrated in Maternal and Child Health (MCH) services throughout breastfeeding. Trial-derived inputs included: 12-month maternal retention in care and virologic suppression (SOC: 49%, MCH-ART: 67%), breastfeeding duration (SOC: 6 months, MCH-ART: 8 months), and postpartum healthcare costs for mother-infant pairs (SOC: $50, MCH-ART: $69). Outcomes included pediatric HIV infections, maternal and infant life expectancy (LE), lifetime HIV-related per-person costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs; ICER <US$903/YLS considered “cost-effective”). Results Compared to SOC, MCH-ART increased maternal LE (SOC: 25.26 years, MCH-ART: 26.20 years) and lifetime costs (SOC: $9,912, MCH-ART: $10,207; discounted). Projected pediatric outcomes for all HIV-exposed children were similar between arms, although undiscounted LE for HIV-infected children was shorter in SOC (SOC: 23.13 years, MCH-ART: 23.40 years). Combining discounted maternal and pediatric outcomes, the ICER was $599/ YLS. Conclusion Co-located maternal HIV and pediatric care, integrated in MCH services throughout breastfeeding, is a cost-effective strategy to improve maternal and pediatric outcomes and should be implemented in South Africa.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225104;5.7;5.4;5.2;;31730630;e0225104;;;

Journal of the International AIDS Society published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of the International AIDS Society.Introduction: The relative efficacy of different antiretroviral (ART) regimens has been extensively evaluated in the context of clinical trials, using HIV viral load (VL) measurements at pre-specified timepoints after ART onset. However, data from real-life studies using combined longitudinal measurements of cumulative viraemia are scarce. This study aimed to address the independent effect of different ART regimens on HIV cumulative viraemia over the first 12 months after treatment initiation, using programmatic data from the Ministry of Health of Brazil. Methods: Retrospective cohort study analysing cumulative viraemia under the most frequently used ART regimens in Brazil (tenofovir, lamivudine and dolutegravir (regimen 1); tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz (regimen 2); tenofovir, lamivudine and ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (regimen 3)). Results and Discussion: We included 112,243 patients >12 years old who received their first ART prescription between January 2014 and August 2017. Univariate analysis indicated that cumulative viraemia was significantly lower in patients receiving regimen 1 as compared with those receiving regimens 2 or 3 (p<0.0001 for both pairwise comparisons). In a multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex, baseline T CD4+ counts and baseline HIV VL, ART regimen persisted with statistically significant effect on 12-month cumulative viraemia. The model predicted a 45-unit increase in log10 copy-days/mL cumulative viraemia for regimen 2 as compared with regimen 1, and a 70-unit increase in log10 copy-days/mL cumulative viraemia for regimen 3 as compared with regimen 1 (95%CI 41 to 49 and 61 to 79 respectively; p<0.001 for both comparisons). In models restricted to youths (13 to 24 years old) and female patients, ART regimen had similar effects. ART regimen with dolutegravir in association with a tenofovir-lamivudine backbone was superior to regimens containing efavirenz or boosted atazanavir in reducing HIV VL, as shown by cumulative viraemia over the first 12 months after treatment initiation. The superiority persisted even after adjusting the analysis for potential confounders. Conclusions: Our findings could bring direct benefits to patients as suggested by lower viral replication during treatment, lower risk of HIV transmission, and a potential reduction in resistance mutations in the initial 12 months under ART.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jia2.25397;5.5;6.7;7.1;;31743620;e25397;;;

Cardiovascular risk factors, including the predictor of subclinical atherosclerosis, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), are reported to be associated with NCI. Data on NCI and its association with cIMT among HIV positive are limited, especially in Asian populations. We aimed to determine the prevalence of NCI and its association with cIMT among HIV-positive and HIV-negative aging Thai individuals. Cognitive performance was evaluated by the Thai version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) with a cutoff of <25/30 for diagnosis of NCI. Depression was evaluated by PHQ-9 Patient Depression Questionnaire, with scores 5 indicating depression. cIMT measurement was performed by experienced neurologists, and abnormal cIMT was defined as cIMT 0.9 mm or presence of carotid plaques. Among 340 well suppressed and aging HIV-positive and 102 HIV-negative matched participants, the median age (interquartile range) was 55 (52-59) years and 61.5% were males. For HIV positive group, the median duration on antiretroviral therapy was 18.3 years with median CD4 of 615.5 cells/mm3, and 97.4% had current plasma HIV RNA <50 copies/mL. The most common antiretroviral agents used were tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (76.8%), lamivudine (70.3%), efavirenz (26.7%), and emtricitabine (23.8%). HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants performed comparably between each domain and had comparable prevalence of NCI (59.4% vs. 61.7%, p = .69). However, the HIV-positive group had a high prevalence of depression (24.71% vs. 13.73%, p = .019). HIV-positive status [adjusted odd ratio (aOR) 0.91; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-1.47, p = .71] and cIMT (aOR 1.17; 95% CI 0.77-1.79, p = .47) were not significantly associated with NCI. Given the high prevalence of NCI and depression among aging HIV-positive individuals, routine screening for NCI and depression should be integrated into the HIV care services.";https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2019.0139;3.3;3.2;3.4;;31588776;;;;

Areas covered: The pharmacological rationale that explains why it is possible to use triple therapy in asthma and the results of clinical studies that have explored the effects of this therapy in asthmatics is critically examined. A systematic search was conducted on 10 August 2019, and included six electronic databases: EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Expert opinion: The real role of single inhaler triple therapy in asthma will be demonstrated when the various trials that are currently ongoing or are scheduled will be completed. We believe that it is appropriate to treat with triple therapy asthmatic patients who have smoked and remain symptomatic or suffer from frequent exacerbations despite initial inhaler therapy with ICS/LABA. However, we must establish when to step up or mainly step down triple therapy especially in patients who are well controlled, and what will be the cost of these combinations in the management of asthma.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17476348.2019.1657408;3.7;4.0;4.2;;31422716;;;;

Geriatrics & Gerontology International published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of Japan Geriatrics SocietyAim: To determine the real-world use of fixed-dose combinations (FDC) of antihypertensive agents using data collected from a nationwide medical database of acute hospitals in Japan. Methods: We carried out a retrospective analysis of data from the Medical Data Vision database for patients with hypertension who received an antihypertensive drug prescription between April 2014 and March 2015. The prescription rate of antihypertensive FDC were assessed by class, age and according to combinations. Results: In total, data from 59 867 patients aged 70.0 ± 11.9 years (mean ± SD) were analyzed. Patients were prescribed 1.9 ± 1.0 oral antihypertensive agents (mean ± SD). Overall, 58.6% of patients were prescribed two or more antihypertensive agents, and the most frequently prescribed classes were calcium channel blockers (CCB) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). As the number of concomitant antihypertensive agents prescribed increased, the prescription rate of a CCB + an ARB FDC decreased, whereas the prescription rate of an ARB + a diuretic FDC increased. This trend was the same regardless of age. Of the 12 222 patients who were prescribed a CCB + an ARB, 26.0% received a FDC. In contrast, of the 922 patients prescribed an ARB + a thiazide diuretic, 80.6% received a FDC. Medium doses of both CCB and ARB agents, and low doses of diuretics were the most frequently prescribed for each class. Conclusions: Our analyses show that the real-world use of FDC varies depending on the combination of agent class and the number of prescriptions; the latter was similar regardless of age.

At least four fixed-dose ICS/LABA combinations are available, including budesonide/formoterol, beclomethasone/formoterol, fluticasone/vilanterol and fluticasone/salmeterol, but there is little guidance for clinicians on which of these combinations to prescribe. Areas covered: The aim of this in-depth review was to identify studies that compared budesonide/formoterol with the other ICS/LABA combinations and assess the data on exacerbations, safety, and patient quality of life. PubMed and Ovid databases were searched, and 14 studies were identified. Our findings highlight the lack of prospective, randomized, controlled trials comparing LABA/ICS combinations in the treatment of COPD as only two such studies were identified. However, current evidence suggests that the effects of budesonide/formoterol on reducing exacerbations and improving quality of life may be similar to, or more marked than, those of other LABA/ICS combinations in COPD and, compared with the other LABA/ICS combinations, budesonide/formoterol may be associated with a lower incidence of serious pneumonia events and oral candidiasis. Expert opinion: To better guide clinicians in selecting between the available ICS/LABA, robust meta-analyses and well-designed head-to-head clinical trials are urgently needed.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17476348.2019.1665514;3.7;4.0;4.2;;31498714;;;;

The fluorescence signal was proportional to the amount (mass) of DNA in the sample. The results confirmed a linear fit from 0.0665 to 1.17 g/L for gDNA, corresponding to 2.0 × 106 to 35.0 × 106 cells/PBMC sample. Intra-batch and inter-batch accuracy (%RE) was within ±15%, and precision (%CV) was <15%. Benchtop stability, freeze/thaw stability and long term storage stability of gDNA in QC sample matrix, PBMC pellets samples, and pellet debris samples, respectively, as well as dilution linearity had been established. Consistency between hemocytometry cell counting method and gDNA-based counting method was established. 6 out of 6 evaluated PBMC lots had hemocytometry cell counts that were within ±20% of the cell counts determined by the gDNA method. This method was used in conjunction with a validated LC-MS/MS method to determine the level of tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP), the active intracellular metabolite of the prodrugs tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), measured in PBMCs in clinical trials of TAF or TDF-containing fixed dose combinations.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003269719305469;4.3;4.2;4.8;S0003269719305469;31437427;113399;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0003269719305469;;

So, we examined potential correlation between vitamin D status and atherosclerosis in people living with HIV. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed including adult HIV-infected patients on stable antiretroviral therapy, aged 40–60 years, and with a recent carotid ultrasonography. Subclinical atherosclerosis was defined as a carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) 0.9 mm at any site. Patients with diabetes mellitus or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were excluded. Results: On the whole, 188 patients were enrolled: 86.2% were men and the mean age was 49.1 years. The mean CD4 T lymphocyte count was 567 cells/mm3, 176 (93.6%) had plasma HIV RNA <20 copies/mL, 51.1% were smoker, 29.2% had hypertension, 27.7% metabolic syndrome, and 44.7% LDL cholesterol >150 mg/dL. The mean serum concentration of vitamin D was 35.2 ng/mL, and 84 (44.6%) patients had a vitamin D insufficiency (<30 ng/mL). Subclinical atherosclerosis was reported in 105 (55.8%) and the mean vitamin D concentration was significantly lower among patients with subclinical atherosclerosis than among those without (18.2 vs 41.3 ng/mL, p < 0.001). Moreover, the multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted by confounding factors showed an independent association between subclinical atherosclerosis and vitamin D insufficiency, age >50 years, smoking, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, higher BMI, higher LDL cholesterol, longer duration of HIV infection, lower nadir CD4 cell count, and longer exposure to boosted protease inhibitors. Conclusion: In our study, vitamin D insufficiency is significantly associated with subclinical atherosclerosis, so its role in HIV-associated cardiovascular disease should be further evaluated as a possible target for intervention.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/25787489.2020.1724749;0;0;0.1;;32065065;;;;

Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.Background: Untreated, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may lead to progressive liver damage, which can be mitigated by successful treatment. This integrated analysis reports the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of the ribavirin-free, direct-acting, antiviral, fixed-dose combination of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) in patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infections and compensated liver disease, including patients with chronic kidney disease stages 4 or 5 (CKD 4/5). Methods: Data from 9 Phase II and III clinical trials, assessing the efficacy and safety of G/P treatment for 8-16 weeks, were included. The presence of cirrhosis was determined at screening using a liver biopsy, transient elastography, or serum biomarkers. The objectives were to evaluate safety, the rate of sustained virologic response at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12), and steady-state PK by cirrhosis status. Results: Among 2369 patients, 308 (13%) were Child-Pugh Class A, including 20 with CKD 4/5. Overall, <1% of patients experienced an adverse event (AE) that led to G/P discontinuation or G/P-related serious AEs (SAEs). The most common AEs were headache and fatigue, occurring at similar frequencies with and without cirrhosis. SAEs were more common in patients with CKD 4/5, but all were unrelated to G/P. There were no cases of drug-induced liver injury or clinically relevant hepatic decompensation. SVR12 rates were 96.4% (297/308) with compensated cirrhosis and 97.5% (2010/2061) without cirrhosis. PK analysis demonstrated a 2.2-fold increase in glecaprevir exposure, but not pibrentasvir exposure, in patients with compensated cirrhosis.

The trajectory of HIV-related inflammation may vary with the timing of ART initiation. We examined immune activation markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood specimens collected over 96 weeks from participants who initiated ART during acute HIV infection (AHI). Methods: RV254/SEARCH010 study participants with AHI underwent CSF (n = 89) and plasma (n = 146) sampling before initiating ART and at weeks 24 and 96 of treatment. A majority participants (64.4%) received a standard ART regimen (hereafter, ""standard ART""), with some (34.7%) also receiving maraviroc and raltegravir for the first 24 weeks (hereafter, ""ART plus""). We compared neopterin, CXCL10, CCL2, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels in the AHI group to those in 18 healthy, uninfected controls. Results: Following 24 and 96 weeks of treatment, levels of all CSF markers normalized while levels of several plasma markers remained elevated in the AHI group (P <. 001). Participants receiving the ART-plus regimen had lower median plasma CCL2 levels at week 24 and lower plasma neopterin levels at week 96. Conclusions: ART initiation during AHI differentially impacts the brain compartment, with markers of inflammation returning to normal levels in the CSF, where they were sustained at week 96, but not in plasma.";https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/220/12/1885/5298345;10.4;9.2;9.0;;30668739;;;;

Objectives: To plan for a larger trial, we sought to obtain preliminary estimates for the difference in the change in BMD at 48 weeks achieved with 24 weeks of prophylactic alendronate/vitamin D during ART initiation compared to no intervention, the within-group standard deviation of this change, and intra-patient correlation coefficient for repeated BMDs. Secondary objectives included assessing enrollment feasibility, treatment acceptability, adherence and safety. Methods: We randomized treatment-naïve HIV-positive adults initiating tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat or abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir 1:1:1 to immediate alendronate/vitamin D3 70 mg/5600 IU for 24 weeks (concomitant treatment arm, CTA), the same intervention starting 24 weeks after study entry (delayed treatment arm, DTA), or no bone anti-resorptive therapy (standard of care, SOC). We assessed BMD, acceptability, adverse events and drug adherence at baseline, week 24 and week 48. Results: Of 29 included participants, 72% initiated TDF/FTC/ELV/c and 28% initiated ABC/3TC/DTG. Median (IQR) CD4 count was 388 (303,525) cells/mm3 and median plasma HIV RNA was 4.45 (2.26, 4.84) log10 copies/mL. The mean (SD) percentage change in BMD for the CTA and DTA combined was 1.95% (2.53%), 0.38% (3.34%), and 0.57% (3.50%) at the lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip respectively at 48 weeks. The ICC among repeated measurements of BMD was 0.978, 0.964, and 0.967 at these sites, respectively. Enrollment feasibility, drug acceptability, adherence, and tolerability were good. Conclusions: Our findings inform the sample size for a larger trial of bone anti-resorptive therapy during ART initiation and support feasibility.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/25787489.2020.1730114;0;0;0.1;;32106792;;;;

This study investigated the inhibitory potency of selected antiretroviral regimens on the metabolic clearance of riociguat. Methods: The inhibitory potential of the components of six antiretroviral combinations (ATRIPLA® (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil), COMPLERA® (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil), STRIBILD® (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil), TRIUMEQ® (abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine), and two ritonavir-boosted regimens) on riociguat metabolism were evaluated in recombinant human CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 as well as in human hepatocytes exhibiting both CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 activity. In vitro-in vivo correlation was performed between calculated and observed increases in riociguat exposure in vivo. Results: Using both in vitro systems, the predicted increase in exposure of riociguat was highest with components of TRIUMEQ® followed by COMPLERA®, ATRIPLA®, STRIBILD®, and the ritonavir-boosted regimens. Further experiments in human hepatocytes confirmed CYP1A1 to be the predominant enzyme in the metabolic clearance of riociguat. Conclusion: Antiretroviral treatment containing the potent CYP1A1 inhibitor abacavir had the greatest impact on riociguat metabolic clearance. The impact of comedications containing only strong CYP3A4 inhibitors e.g. ritonavir was less pronounced, suggesting a benefit of riociguat over PAH-targeting medications with contraindications for use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17425255.2019.1681968;5.7;5.9;6.4;;31619082;;;;

Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed to determine the impact of change from three to four drugs schemes on the TB cure and frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in TB patients. To answer this question, we used data from 730 randomly selected patients who received anti-TB treatment between January 2007 and December 2014 in a reference center from Salvador, Brazil. Findings TB patients who received the RHEZ regimen (n = 365) developed ADRs more frequently than those treated with the RHZ (n = 365) (86 [23.6%] vs. 55 [15.1%]; p = 0.01). This difference in ADR incidence was even higher in patients above 30 years-old (64 [74.4%] vs. 36 [65.5%]; p = 0.01). The overall number of ADR episodes was greater in patients from the RHEZ group than in the group that received RHZ (170 [61.4%] vs. 107 [38.6%]; p = 0.03). Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, alcohol use and diabetes demonstrated that patients receiving the RHEZ regimen had increased odds of developing ADRs than those undertaking the RHZ scheme (odds ratio [OR]: 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-2.35; p = 0.015). The overall cure rate was similar between the distinct treatment groups. Conclusion The patients treated with the four-drug regimen exhibited increased risk of ADRs compared to those who received the three-drug regimen, and especially in patients older than 30 years of age.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0227101;5.7;5.4;5.2;;31877199;e0227101;;;

In these countries, IHD mortality rates are significantly greater in individuals of a low socioeconomic status (SES). Main text: Three important focus areas for decreasing IHD mortality among those of low SES in LLMICs are (1) acute coronary care; (2) cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention; and (3) primary prevention. Greater mortality in low SES patients with acute coronary syndrome is due to lack of awareness of symptoms in patients and primary care physicians, delay in reaching healthcare facilities, non-availability of thrombolysis and coronary revascularization, and the non-affordability of expensive medicines (statins, dual anti-platelets, renin-angiotensin system blockers). Facilities for rapid diagnosis and accessible and affordable long-term care at secondary and tertiary care hospitals for IHD care are needed. A strong focus on the social determinants of health (low education, poverty, working and living conditions), greater healthcare financing, and efficient primary care is required. The quality of primary prevention needs to be improved with initiatives to eliminate tobacco and trans-fats and to reduce the consumption of alcohol, refined carbohydrates, and salt along with the promotion of healthy foods and physical activity. Efficient primary care with a focus on management of blood pressure, lipids and diabetes is needed. Task sharing with community health workers, electronic decision support systems, and use of fixed-dose combinations of blood pressure-lowering drugs and statins can substantially reduce risk factors and potentially lead to large reductions in IHD. Finally, training of physicians, nurses, and health workers in IHD prevention should be strengthened. Conclusion: The management and prevention of IHD in individuals with a low SES in LLMICs are poor. Greater availability, access, and affordability for acute coronary syndrome management and secondary prevention are important. Primary prevention should focus on tackling the social determinants of health as well as policy and individual interventions for risk factor control, supported by task sharing and use of technology.";https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-019-1454-y;13.6;13.6;11.3;;31767015;209;;;

However, little is known about the effects on LVMI of a triple fixed-dose combination (TFC) therapy, containing in a single pill an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), a diuretic and a calcium channel blocker (CCB). Methods: In this prospective open-label study, 92 patients with essential hypertension were randomized to treatment with a TFC of perindopril/indapamide/amlodipine at different doses or a triple free combination therapy (FCT) including ACEI/diuretic/CCB. Office blood pressure (BP) measurement, 24 h-ambulatory BP monitoring and echocardiography were performed at baseline and during a 14-month follow-up. The BP variability (BPV) over 24 h was calculated as ± standard deviation of the daytime systolic BP. Differences between office and monitored BP and LVMI were evaluated by ANOVA for repeated measures. Results: A significant BP-lowering effect was observed for both treatments. At follow-up, BPV was reduced in both the treatment groups vs. the baseline (14.0±1.5 vs. 17.0±1.8 and 16.2±2.1 vs. 17.6±2.3, respectively), but it was lower in the TFC vs. the FCT group (14.0±1.5 vs. 16.1±2.2, P < 0.05). LVMI was lower in both the treatment groups, but the change was greater for TFC vs. FCT (8.3±4.9% vs. 2.0 ±2.1%, P < 0.0001). Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) regression was greater in the TFC vs. the FCT group (43.5% vs. 30.4%, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Independently of BP values achieved, the antihypertensive TFC therapy was more effective than FCT in LVMI reduction and LVH regression, possibly related to drugs’ intrinsic properties and to BPV modulation.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0753332219343550;2.8;4.0;6.4;S0753332219343550;31627089;109539;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0753332219343550;;

However, dual bronchodilation remains the cornerstone for the treatment of most COPD patients. Combining a long-acting 2 adrenoceptor agonist (LABA) with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) induces appreciable synergistic bronchorelaxant effect in human airways, especially when the medications are combined at isoeffective concentrations. Thus, each LABA/LAMA combination is characterized by a specific range of concentration-ratio at which the drug mixture may induce sustained synergistic interaction. Results of a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT, NCT00696020) and evidences from pre-clinical studies in human isolated airways poses the question whether combining tiotropium 5 g with olodaterol 5 g is the best combination option: tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 g has the same efficacy profile of tiotropium/olodaterol 5/2 g, and it is less effective than tiotropium/olodaterol 5/10 g. Furthermore, tiotropium/olodaterol 5/2 g, 5/5 g, and 5/10 g combinations are generally characterized by the same safety profile. Indeed tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 g is effective and safe in COPD, but a different development strategy based on solid data obtained from human isolated airways would have driven towards a better-balanced FDC to be tested in Phase III RCTs. Accurate bench-to-bedside plans are needed also in the development of triple combination therapies for asthma and COPD, in which the presence of an ICS in the formulation may further modulate the beneficial interaction between the LABA and the LAMA.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12325-019-01119-w;4.2;4.6;5.0;;31654332;;;;

This study analyzed the daily runoff time series at six gauging stations during 1960–2016 in Wuding River basin, northwestern China. The Mann–Kendall test and Lee-Heghinian method were employed to detect the temporal trends and abrupt changes in annual streamflow. The flow duration curve (FDC) and the index of hydrologic alteration (IHA)/Range of Variability Approach (RVA) were applied to assess the daily streamflow and degree of hydrologic alteration (DHA). In addition, we analyzed the changes of index of hydrological connectivity (IC) and reservoirs/dams (RI) in 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2015 in the basin. The relationship between IC, RI and DHA were assessed to investigate the potential influences of land use changes and constructions of reservoirs/dams on hydrological alteration. The results indicated that annual streamflow at five stations showed significant downward trends (p < 0.01) from 1960 to 2016, and an abrupt changing point appeared in the beginning of 1970s in Wuding River basin. Exception is Qingyangcha station without significant changes, and Hanjiamao station with changing point in 1967. FDC analysis indicated that both high and low flow indices reduced greatly. The integral DHA were higher than 70% at all the stations in the Wuding River basin, suggesting great variation in the magnitude, duration, frequency, timing and rate of change of daily streamflow. Both IC value and RI had close relationship with DHA, implying that DHA was highly affected by land use changes and dams/reservoirs constructions, and was more sensitive to the land use change (p < 0.01).

Here we present a translational pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic mathematical model to support optimal dose selection of relebactam. Methods: Data derived from in vitro checkerboard and hollow fiber infection studies of imipenem-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were incorporated into the model. The model integrates the effect of relebactam concentration on imipenem susceptibility in a semi-mechanistic manner using the checkerboard data and characterizes the bacterial time-kill profiles from the hollow fiber infection model data. Results: Simulations demonstrated that the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve for free drug to the minimum inhibitory concentration (fAUC/MIC) was the pharmacokinetic driver for relebactam, with a target fAUC/MIC = 7.5 associated with 2-log kill. At a clinical dose of 250 mg relebactam, greater than 2-log reductions in bacterial load are projected for imipenem-resistant strains with an imipenem/relebactam MIC  4 g/mL. Conclusions: The study confirms that the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic driver for relebactam is fAUC/MIC, that an fAUC/MIC ratio of 7.5 is associated with 2-log kill in vitro, and that a 250 mg clinical dose of relebactam achieves this target value when delivered in combination with imipenem/cilastatin.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1201971219303522;5.3;5.6;5.3;S1201971219303522;31479762;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1201971219303522;;

Although lung deposition of ICS/LABA is dependent on the inhaler device and inhalation technique, there have been few studies comparing the risk for pneumonia according to the type of device used to deliver ICS/LABA in real-world practice. A retrospective cohort study was performed using the National Health Insurance Database of the Korean Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service. New users who began ICS/LABA were selected and followed-up 180 days after ICS/LABA initiation. The risk for pneumonia requiring emergency room (ER) visit or admission was compared according to inhaler device used—pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) or dry powder inhaler (DPI)—after individual exact matching (1:5). Among the eligible cohort of 245,477 new ICS/LABA users, 7,942 patients who used pMDI only were matched with 39,690 patients who used DPI only. The incidence of pneumonia was higher in the pMDI group (1.6%) than the DPI group (1.1%); the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for pneumonia was 1.6 (95% CI 1.3–2.0; p < 0.0001). In subgroup analyses, a significantly higher risk for pneumonia was found in the pMDI group compared with the DPI group regardless of the presence of history of pneumonia (HR 1.7 [95% CI 1.2–2.3]; p = 0.002), COPD (HR 1.6 [95% CI 1.2–2.0]; p = 0.0007), or asthma (HR 1.6 [95% CI 1.2–2.2]; p = 0.0008).

Different mouth-throat anatomies at varying simulated inhalation flows were used to calculate the lung dose of indacaterol/glycopyrronium [IND/GLY] 110/50 µg (QVA149) from the dry-powder inhaler Breezhaler®. Sources of variability in lung dose were studied using computational fluid dynamics, supported by aerosol particle sizing measurements, particle image velocimetry and computed tomography. Anatomical differences in mouth-throat geometries were identified as a major source of inter-subject variability in lung deposition. Lung dose was similar across inhalation flows of 30–120 L/min with a slight drop in calculated delivery at high inspiratory flows. Delivery was relatively unaffected by inhaler inclination angle. The delivered lung dose of the fixed-dose combination IND/GLY matched well with corresponding monotherapy doses. This biophysical model indicates low extra-thoracic drug loss and consistent lung delivery of IND/GLY, independent of inhalation flows. This is an important finding for patients across various ages and lung disease severities. The model provides a quantitative, mechanistic simulation of inhaled therapies that could provide a test system for estimating drug delivery to the lung and complement traditional clinical studies.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2590156719300325;0;0;0.3;S2590156719300325;;100018;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2590156719300325;;

Most recent European and American guidelines recommend both thiazide-type and thiazide-like diuretics as first-line drugs for all patients with hypertension. In contrast, diuretics are not regarded as first-line treatment in the UK and in patients who are to be initiated on a diuretic treatment, thiazide-like molecules, such as chlortalidone and indapamide are the preferred option. This review examines the prescribing trend of the 4 most commonly prescribed thiazide diuretics for the treatment of hypertension in the UK. Prescription cost analysis data were obtained for both 2010 and 2016/2017 for each region of the UK to analyse the impact of the 2011 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence hypertension guidelines on the trend in thiazide diuretic prescribing. Overall, the prescriptions of thiazide diuretics declined over the years. Bendroflumethiazide is the most commonly prescribed diuretic in the UK and despite some geographical differences, thiazide-type diuretics are more widely used than thiazide-like. The use of indapamide increased significantly between 2010 and 2016/2017 while chlortalidone was rarely employed. Of the many factors affecting trends in prescriptions, clinical inertia, treatment adherence, availability of the products and the lack of fixed dose combinations may play a role.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bcp.14109;7.1;7.0;6.9;;31471972;;;;

Identifying patients at risk of overestimation of asthma control remains elusive. This study aimed to (i) investigate the relationship between patient-reported and actual level of asthma control (ii), compare the characteristics between patients who believe their asthma is well controlled that accurately report ‘well-controlled’ asthma with those that do not, and (iii) identify factors associated with inaccurately reported ‘well-controlled’ asthma. A historical, multinational, cross-sectional study using data from the iHARP (initiative Helping Asthma in Real-life Patients) review service for adults with asthma prescribed fixed-dose combination therapy. Data from 4274 patients were analysed. A major discrepancy between patient-reported and Global Initiative for Asthma defined asthma control was detected; 71.1% of patients who reported ‘well-controlled’ asthma were inaccurate in their perception despite receiving regular maintenance therapy. Significant differences were noted in age, gender, body mass index, education level, medication use, side effects, attitudes to preventer inhaler use, inhaler technique review and respiratory specialist review between patients who accurately reported ‘well-controlled’ asthma and those who did not. Independent risk factors associated with inaccurately reported ‘well-controlled’ asthma were: having taken a maximum of 5–12 puffs or more of reliever inhaler on at least one day within the previous 4 weeks; being female; having seen a respiratory specialist more than a year ago (rather than in the previous year); and having required oral corticosteroids for worsening asthma in the previous year.

We used 2015 prescription claims data from Medicare Part D and 3 IBM MarketScan databases (Commercial, Medicaid, Medicare Supplemental) to calculate medication nonadherence rates among hypertensive adults aged 18 years with public or private health insurance using the proportion of days covered algorithm. These findings, in combination with National Health Interview Survey findings, were used to project national weighted estimates of nonadherence.

We show that the stromal deficiency of FcRIIB does not affect GC B cell frequencies compared to wild-type mice. However, in the absence of FcRIIB on FDCs, GCs show aberrant B cell selection during autoreactive and selective foreign antigen responses. These GCs are more diverse as measured by the AidCreERT2 -confetti system and show the persistence of IgM+ clones with decreased numbers of IgH mutations.

VS was defined as < 1000 copies/mL of blood plasma and controlled viremia as VL < 50 copies/mL. Data were analysed by SPSS; p < 0.05 considered as significant. Results: 1946 patients (70% female) were enrolled (1800 adults, 105 adolescents, 41 children); 1841 were on NNRTI-based and 105 on PI-based therapy; with 346 patients at M12, 270 at M24, 205 at M36 and 1125 at  M48.

Complications from inappropriate warfarin dosing are one of the most common reasons for emergency room visits. Approximately one third of warfarin dose variability results from common genetic variants. Therefore, it is very necessary to recognize warfarin sensitivity in individuals caused by genetic variants. Based on combined polymorphisms in CYP2C9 and VKORC1, we established a clinical classification for warfarin sensitivity. In the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetic Consortium (IWPC) with 5542 patients, we found that 95.1% of the Black in the IWPC cohort were normal warfarin responders, while 74.8% of the Asian were warfarin sensitive (P < 0.001). Moreover, we created a clinical algorithm to predict warfarin sensitivity in individual patients using logistic regression. Compared to a fixed-dose approach, the clinical algorithm provided significantly better performance. In addition, we validated the derived clinical algorithm using the external Easton cohort with 106 chronic warfarin users.

In the EU, the fluticasone/formoterol 50/5 µg pMDI is recommended for use in adults, adolescents and children aged  5 years, with the latter being a recent expansion of the indicated population and the focus of this review. Fluticasone/formoterol 50/5 µg, administered as two actuations (i.e. 100/10 µg) twice daily, provided benefit over fluticasone propionate 100 µg twice daily and was noninferior to fluticasone/salmeterol 100/50 µg twice daily, in improving lung function in patients aged 5 to < 12 or 4–12 years in randomized trials. Fluticasone/formoterol was generally similar to each of these comparator pMDI regimens in terms of asthma exacerbation rates and patient-reported measures and was generally well tolerated, with no evidence of clinically meaningful systemic adverse effects over up to 36 weeks of treatment. Longer-term data would be of interest.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40267-019-00685-x;0.2;0.3;0.4;;;;;;

Factors that influence the early accumulation of prions in Peyer’s patches can directly influence disease pathogenesis. The host’s immune response to a gastrointestinal helminth infection can alter susceptibility to co-infection with certain pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Here we used the natural mouse small intestine-restricted helminth pathogen Heligmosomoides polygyrus to test the hypothesis that pathology specifically within the small intestine caused by a helminth co-infection would influence oral prion disease pathogenesis. When mice were co-infected with prions on d 8 after H. polygyrus infection the early accumulation of prions within Peyer’s patches was reduced and survival times significantly extended. Natural prion susceptible hosts such as sheep, deer and cattle are regularly exposed to gastrointestinal helminth parasites. Our data suggest that co-infections with small intestine-restricted helminth pathogens may be important factors that influence oral prion disease pathogenesis.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-42900-9;4.8;6.4;7.2;;31040320;6674;;;

A number of single drugs as well as fixed dose combinations have been banned from manufacturing, marketing and distribution in India. An important issue about the availability of banned drugs over the counter in India is that sufficient adverse drug reactions data about these drugs have not been reported. The most common categories of drugs withdrawn in the last decade were non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (28%), antidiabetics (14.28%), antiobesity (14.28%), antihistamines (14.28%), gastroprokinetic drugs (7.14%), breast cancer and infertility drugs (7.14%), irritable bowel syndrome and constipation drugs (7.14%) and antibiotics (7.14%). Drug withdrawals from market were made mainly due to safety issues involving cardiovascular events (57.14%), liver damage (14.28%), and carcinogenic reasons. Majority of drugs have been banned since 3-5 years in other countries but are still available for sale in India. The present study says about how to manage adverse drug reactions and to prevent it in advance and provides implications for developing a system that can ensure the safety and efficacy of drugs in India.There should be a multidisciplinary approach towards drug safety that should be implemented throughout the entire duration spanning from drug discovery to usage by consumers.;None;0.1;0.1;0;;;;;;

This issue was addressed by developing Low Impact Development (LID) practices to deliver better hydrologic function and improve the environmental, economic, social and cultural outcomes. This study developed a modeling software to simulate and optimize bioretentions among LID in a given watershed. The model calculated a detailed soil infiltration process in bioretention with hydrological conditions (e.g. unsaturated and saturated soil) and hydraulic facilities (e.g. riser and underdrain) and also generated an optimized plan using Flow Duration Curve (FDC). The optimization result from the simulation demonstrated that the location and size of bioretention, as well as the soil texture, are important elements for an efficient bioretention.

However, there is a risk of selecting viral escape mutants, so a new combination is needed using different inhibitors that target different steps of the HCV infectious cycle. Novel single tablet formulations were developed: Dactavira, composed of sofosbuvir (SOF) 400 mg/daclatisvir (DCV) 60 mg/epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) 400 mg without ribavirin (RBV); and Dactavira plus, which includes RBV 800 mg.

Group A was randomly assigned to receive a single daily fixed-dose (Dactavira, n = 25) or the standard of care [SOF 400 mg/DCV 60 mg] (n = 25) daily for 12 weeks. Group B was randomly assigned to receive a single daily fixed-dose (Dactavira plus, n = 11) or the standard of care + RBV 800 mg (n = 11) daily for 12 weeks. Patients receiving Dactavira or Dactavira plus had a significantly more rapid rate of viral load decline as compared to patients receiving the standard of care therapy. Sustained virological response for 12 weeks for Dactavira or Dactavira plus showed no statistically significant difference when compared to the standard of care. Also, they did not affect normal hemoglobin levels (p < 0.001) versus the standard of care. The incorporated EGCG interferes with the viral entry mechanisms, as reported by several investigators, and in turn enhances efficacy and prevents relapse as compared to the standard of care.

Although isoniazid also degrades partially, its degradation is reversible. Objective: Presently, we provide a proof of the fact that the simultaneous oral administration of rifam-picin (RIF), upon incorporation into solid lipid nanoparticles (RIF-SLNs), with isoniazid (INH) over-comes its INH-induced degradation and improves its oral bioavailability in rats. Methods: Solid lipid nanoparticles of RIF (RIF-SLNs) were prepared using a novel and patented method. The effect of INH was investigated on in vivo bioavailability of RIF both in its free and encap-sulated (RIF-SLNs) form, after oral administration to rats. Results: Cmax and AUC0- of RIF increased 158 % and 125 %, respectively, upon incorporation into SLNs versus free RIF when combined with INH. The Tmax decreased from 5.67 h to 3.3 h, and the plasma concentration of RIF remained above its MIC (8 µg/ml) at all the tested time points starting with 15 min, when administered as RIF-SLNs in combination with INH. Conclusion: The results confirm the scope of combining RIF-SLNs with INH to overcome the bioavail-ability of free RIF when combined with INH, especially in fixed dose combinations.;https://www.eurekaselect.com/179577/article;2.8;2.7;3.2;;32077827;;;;

The prescribed drug may be associated with an adjuvant diuretic compound such as furosemide (FUR), to treat cardiovascular disorders. This work presents the pharmaceutical development of ATV and FUR mixtures by FTIR, XRPD, and thermal analysis in a long-term study. DSC results indicate atorvastatin water loss and polymorphic furosemide conversion in the temperature range 115–160 °C, as occurs with individual drugs, so it does not attest interaction between them. These are thermal phenomena that occur at a temperature attainable during tableting technology. For this reason, the kinetic study was performed in this temperature range.The kinetics of ATV and FUR was studied by Vyazovkin isoconversional method in the times of zero and 24 months and by a neural network. Hirshfeld surface calculations are also applied. These drugs in static conditions behave as an unreactive mixture. Under heating, for  = 0.3, the interaction between ATV and FUR required activation energy of ˜115 kJ mol1 at the initial time and in 24 months, this energy increases about 10%, within the experimental error, which confirms a stable system. The ATV crystallinity decreases with heating. These results corroborate for adequate stability of the system in a combined-fixed dose.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0040603119306665;4.5;4.3;4.2;S0040603119306665;;178408;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0040603119306665;;

We selected HIV-HCV-coinfected patients undergoing cognitive examination (exploring memory, language, speed of mental processing and fine motor function) at three clinical centres. Cognitive performance was evaluated using Z-transformed scores. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate variables associated to cognitive impairment (defined as a composite Z-score   1). Overall, 146 HIV-HCV-coinfected patients were enrolled. Median HCV-RNA was 6.2logU/mL. HCV genotype 1a/b was the most represented (53.4%). Liver fibrosis was mild (Fib4  1.45) in the majority of patients (44.5%). Global cognitive impairment was diagnosed in 35 (24%) subjects. Exploring each domain, a higher proportion of impairment was observed for memory (37%) followed by speed of mental processing (32.2%), fine motor functioning (24%) and language (18.5%). Among HCV-related variables, the duration of HCV infection was independently associated with global cognitive impairment (aOR 1.13 per +1 year, p = 0.016) and abnormal speed of mental processing (aOR 1.16 per +1 year, p = 0.001), while higher HCV-RNA was independently associated to fine motor functioning impairment (aOR 1.98 per +1log, p = 0.037). HCV genotype, fibrosis stage, transaminases or bilirubin levels were not related to cognitive performance. Of note, integrase inhibitor (InSTI) use was independently associated to a pathological performance in fine motor functioning (aOR 3.34, p = 0.035) and memory (aOR 3.70, p = 0.014). In conclusion, the duration of HCV infection and HCV-RNA load showed an association with cognitive impairment, suggesting a role of hepatitis-related factors in the development of cognitive disorders in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients. The association between InSTI use and altered cognitive performance should prompt investigations about potential neurotoxicity of these drugs.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13365-019-00780-9;5.0;4.6;4.7;;31281946;;;;

Further research and development is required in this area to introduce more 3D printed products into the market. Our study investigates the potential of fixed dose combination solid dispersion drug products generated via 3D printing. Two model drugs—fluorescein sodium (FS) and 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5-ASA)—were impregnated onto a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) filament, and the influence of solvent choice in optimal drug loading as well as other influences such as the physicochemical and mechanical properties of the resultant filaments were investigated prior to development of the resultant drug products. Key outcomes of this work included the improvement of filament drug loading by one-to threefold due to solvent choice on the basis of its polarity and the generation of a 3D-printed product confirmed to be a solid dispersion fixed dose combination with the two model drugs exhibiting favourable in vitro dissolution characteristics.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/11/12/672;5.2;2.9;2.9;;;672;;;

We sought to describe the real-world use and effectiveness of 2-DR among persons living with HIV (PLHIV) in the United States. Methods: We analysed data for 10,190 treatment-experienced patients from the OPERA® Observational Database initiating a new 2-DR or three-drug regimen (3-DR) between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2016. Multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards models were used to estimate the association among 2-DR or 3-DR initiation and virologic suppression (viral load (VL) <50 copies/mL), virologic failure (2 VLs > 200 copies/mL or 1 VL > 200 copies/mL + discontinuation) or regimen discontinuation. Results: Patients initiating a 2-DR (n = 1337, 13%) were older, and more likely to have a lower CD4 count, a history of AIDS and comorbid conditions than patients initiating a 3-DR. There was no difference between groups in time to virologic suppression (aHR: 1.00 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.13)) among viraemic patients (baseline VL  50 copies/mL, n = 4180), or time to virologic failure (aHR: 1.15 (95% CI: 0.90, 1.48)) among virologically stable patients (baseline VL < 50 copies/mL, n = 6010). However, time to discontinuation was shorter following 2-DR than 3-DR initiation (aHR: 1.51 (95% CI: 1.41, 1.61)). Conclusions: In this large cohort of treatment-experienced patients, 2-DR prescriptions were common and more frequent among patients with significant comorbidity. Virologic response was similar, but duration of use was shorter with a 2-DR than a 3-DR, suggesting that 2-DRs may be a virologically effective treatment strategy for treatment-experienced PLHIV with existing comorbidities.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jia2.25418;5.5;6.7;7.1;;31802641;e25418;;;

Besides their intrinsic properties and the volume fractions of matrix and fibers, the effective elasticity tensors of N are also related to the two-dimensional (2D) or the three-dimensional (3D) fiber direction distributions. Herein the Fourier series and the Wigner D-functions are introduced as the 2D and the 3D fiber direction distribution functions (FDF), respectively. The expanded coefficients of the FDF are called the fiber distribution coefficients (FDC). When N consists of an anisotropic elasticity matrix and numerous transversely isotropic fibers, we derive the effective elasticity tensor C^ of N by the self-consistent method with the 2D FDC or the 3D FDC. The FDC can be easily obtained via the fiber direction arrangements of N for the fiber arbitrary or orthorhombic distributions of N. The procedure of deriving C^ is simple because the Kelvin notation is used to compute tensor rotations. When both the matrix and the fibers are isotropic, for the 2D fiber distributions at least three direction arrangements of fibers are needed to build the fiber-reinforced transversely isotropic composite materials, and for the 3D fiber distributions at least six direction arrangements are needed to build the fiber-reinforced isotropic composite materials. The results of the FEM simulations are consistent with those of our expressions C^.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00707-019-02485-w;3.5;3.6;3.9;;;;;;

As such, physicians and other providers caring for individuals living with HIV infection need to be aware of the potential cardiovascular complications of HIV infection and the nuances of how HIV infection increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, including acute myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral artery disease, heart failure and sudden cardiac death, as well as how to select available therapies to reduce this risk. In this Review, we discuss the epidemiology and clinical features of cardiovascular disease, with a focus on coronary heart disease, in the setting of HIV infection, which includes a substantially increased risk of myocardial infarction even when the HIV infection is well controlled. We also discuss the mechanisms underlying HIV-associated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, such as the high rates of traditional cardiovascular risk factors in patients with HIV infection and HIV-related factors, including the use of antiretroviral therapy and chronic inflammation in the setting of effectively treated HIV infection. Finally, we highlight available therapeutic strategies, as well as approaches under investigation, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and lower inflammation in patients with HIV infection.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-019-0219-9;21.0;24.0;19.9;;31182833;;;;

We examined heterogeneity in neurocognitive change trajectories from HIV diagnosis to 1–2 years post-antiretroviral therapy (ART). In an observational cohort study in Rakai, Uganda, 312 PWH completed a neuropsychological (NP) test battery at two-time points (ART-naïve, 1–2 years post-ART initiation). All NP outcomes were used in a latent profile analysis to identify subgroups of PWH with similar ART-related neurocognitive change profiles. In a subset, we examined subgroup differences pre-ART on cytokine and neurodegenerative biomarkers CSF levels. We identified four ART-related change subgroups: (1) decline-only (learning, memory, fluency, processing speed, and attention measures), (2) mixed (improvements in learning and memory but declines in attention and executive function measures), (3) no-change, or (4) improvement-only (learning, memory, and attention measures). ART-related NP outcomes that are most likely to change included learning, memory, and attention. Motor function measures were unchanged. Subgroups differed on eight of 34 pre-ART biomarker levels including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-13, interferon-, macrophage inflammatory protein-1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, MMP-10, and platelet-derived growth factor-AA. The improvement-only and mixed subgroups showed lower levels on these markers versus the no-change subgroup. These findings provide support for the need to disentangle heterogeneity in ART-related neurocognitive changes, to focus on higher-order cognitive processes (learning, memory, attention) as they were most malleable to change, and to better understand why motor function remained unchanged despite ART treatment. Group differences in pre-ART CSF levels provide preliminary evidence of biological plausibility of neurocognitive phenotyping.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13365-019-00768-5;5.0;4.6;4.7;;31218522;;;;

There have been concerns regarding the CNS efficacy of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) because of its low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations and because it is a substrate of the active efflux transporter P-glycoprotein. Our aim was to investigate whether switching from emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC) to FTC/TAF would lead to changes in residual intrathecal immune activation, viral load, or neurocognitive function. Methods: Twenty HIV-1-infected neuro-asymptomatic adults (11 on ABC/3TC and 9 on FTC/TDF) were included in this prospective study. At baseline, all participants changed their nucleoside analogues to FTC/TAF without any other changes in their ART regimen. We performed lumbar punctures, venipunctures, and neurocognitive testing at baseline and after three and 12 months. Results: During follow-up, there were no significant changes in CSF or plasma HIV RNA, CSF neopterin, CSF 2-microglobulin, IgG index, albumin ratio, CSF NFL, or neurocognitive function in assessed by Cogstate in any of the groups. Conclusion: This small pilot study indicates that switching to FTC/TAF from ABC/3TC or FTC/TDF has neither a positive, nor a negative effect on the HIV infection in the CNS.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23744235.2019.1670352;3.3;3.7;4.0;;31556765;;;;

In this study, we examined the dependency of forest dependent communities (FDC) on forests, and the impacts of PA co-management on their livelihood capital drawing data from Chunati Wildlife Sanctuary (CWS), a pioneer PA of south-eastern Bangladesh. Data on forest dependency was collected through a participatory survey along 28 randomly selected forest trails and remote sensing (RS) analysis of betel leaf plots inside the CWS. To analyze the livelihood capital, we adopted a sustainable livelihood framework and interviewed randomly selected 843 FDC members, and 88 local people who were not involved in PA co-management as control. Remote sensing based vegetation indices were derived to evaluate the trends of vegetation condition in the CWS. Results show that 481 persons were entering into the CWS in a day to collect forest products having an estimated market value of about USD1,856. Even though the extent of cultivation had reduced but local people were still practicing betel leaf farming. The livelihood improvement activities under PA co-management had positive impacts, and livelihood capital indices of the FDC members were significantly higher than that of control group. Similar impact was also reflected in five livelihood capital, and notably the mean monthly household income (financial capital) of FDC members had increased by 53% in five years. The RS based vegetation indices indicate that overall forest condition was gradually improving from 2010 to 2015. In order to endure the livelihood of FDC members and to conserve the forests of CWS sustainably, we recommend further strengthening of human and social capital along with appropriate institutional support.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211464518302689;3.5;5.1;4.8;S2211464518302689;;100456;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2211464518302689;;

It shows both nodal and extranodal involvement. Considering the rarity and difficulties in diagnosing this tumor, we consider it very important to share our experience of diagnosing FDCS. Its correct diagnosis cannot be overemphasized as the treatment and prognosis of FDCS are very much different from tumors which come in its differential diagnosis. Material and Methods: We are presenting eight cases of extranodal FDCS in gastrointestinal tract diagnosed at our center in a period of 3 years (Feb 2015 to Feb 2018). Presenting complaints, demographic details, gross description, histologic features, immunostain results, and clinical follow-up were evaluated. Results: Four patients were females and four were males. Tumor ranged in size from 5.5 to 35 cm. In five cases, tumor cells were arranged in storiform and whorling pattern. Lymphocytes were seen sprinkled in between these cells. In one case, lymphocytic infiltrate was extensive. Giant cells and frequent mitoses were noted in two cases. One case showed extensive necrosis. Tumor cells were strongly and diffusely positive for CD21 and CD35. Mean follow up of 11.8 months (range 01 to 24 months) was noted. Conclusion: FDCS is a rare tumor having distinct morphology and phenotype which if known can be correctly diagnosed. Therefore, knowledge of its varied location, morphology, and phenotype is very important to correctly diagnose this tumor and to prevent misdiagnosis and mistreatment.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12029-018-0178-0;1.8;1.9;1.7;;30430359;;;;

The filters are composed of four resonators arranged in the in-line and folded topology using substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology. The frequency-dependent coupling is implemented bya magnetic coupling iris and a balanced microstrip line with a pair of metallized via-holes, which produces an extra zero in comparison to classical approaches. To verify the characteristics of the proposed FDC, an in-line fourth-order substrate integrated waveguide bandpassfilter (BPF) with one transmission zero and a folded configuration BPF with one small negative slope for independently controlled transmission zero are designed.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9021641/;0;0;0;;;9021641;;true;9781728153049

Published by BMJ.Introduction The treatment standard for high-risk upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UUTUC) is radical nephroureterectomy. However, some patients may be unfit or unwilling, and in such patients the available alternatives are suboptimal. Therapies targeting the programmed death (PD) pathway have shown promise in urothelial carcinom (UC). We designed the current study to determine the safety and efficacy of administering MK-3475 (a monoclonal antibody targeting interaction between PD-1 and its ligand) in combination with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in high-risk non-muscle invasive UUTUC patients. Methods This represents a single-centre phase-II efficacy study of MK-3475 therapy in combination with BCG for subjects, 18 years of age or older, with pathologically documented non-muscle invasive high-risk UUTUC unfit or unwilling to be treated with radical nephroureterectomy. Twenty subjects will be enrolled; patients will receive treatment with 200 mg of MK-3475 every 21 days, starting 2 weeks from the initial endoscopic resection and continuing for 6 weeks after the final dose of BCG. The primary objective is to determine the safety and efficacy of administering MK-3475 at a fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks in conjunction with intrapelvic BCG. Secondary objectives include 19 week and the 3, 12 and 24-month post-treatment completion complete response and progression-free rate assessments. Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Henry Ford Hospital. The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at a scientific conference.

Inhaler technique is critical for drug delivery to the lungs; incorrect technique negatively impacts asthma control and long-term outcomes. Breath-triggered inhalers (BTIs) can simplify drug administration and are suitable for most patients, including those with reduced inspiratory flow. Until recently, no inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting 2-agonist combination BTI was available in Europe. The flutiform® (fluticasone propionate/formoterol fumarate [FP/FORM]) k-haler® is the first combination BTI now approved in Europe for asthma maintenance treatment. Areas covered: We review studies examining the challenges posed to patients by different inhaler types and explore evidence demonstrating the clinical efficacy of FP/FORM administered via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler. We also review the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies supporting FP/FORM k-haler use, and consider data showing high lung deposition with the device. Finally, we review patient experiences using the BTI, device characteristics, and health economic aspects. Expert opinion: Despite the availability of therapies, asthma control levels remain low, and there is a clear need for easy-to-use inhalers. Research to increase our understanding of critical errors with each inhaler and how to overcome them is important for improving care.

Methods: COPD patients were randomized (28 patients/group) to receive TIO/FORMfixed, TIOmono , or TIO/FORMbid. AUC for the changes in FEV1 and FVC over a 24-h period; bronchodilator response (100 ml improvement in FEV1) in the first 30 min; maximum changes in FEV1 and FVC; and safety data were recorded. The primary endpoint was to confirm the non-inferiority of TIO/FORMfixed vs TIO/FORMbid in terms of the AUC for the changes in FEV1 over a 24-h period. Results: Changes in AUC0–24h for FEV1 and FVC were similar for TIO/FORMfixed and TIO/FORMbid, and were superior to TIOmono (p < 0.001). A positive bronchodilator response at 30 min was demonstrated in 50%, 64%, and 71% of patients in the TIOmono, TIO/FORMbid, and TIO/FORMfixed groups, respectively (NS).

These side effects are pervasive in people living with HIV (PLWH). However, the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. We investigated the effects of ART on cholesterol biosynthesis genes. This is a retrospective analysis of data and specimens collected during a cross-sectional, case-control study of ART-induced toxicity. Cases were HIV treatment-experienced individuals with HIV viral suppression and no diagnosis of ART-associated toxicity (n = 18), and controls were HIV-uninfected individuals (n = 18). The mRNA expressions of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) were significantly upregulated in cases (HIV+) compared to controls (HIV-), as well as the corresponding protein expression level of HMGCR. We observed dysregulation between sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2, sensory control) and HMGCR and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) pathways. Dysregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes may predate clinical manifestation of ART-induced lipid abnormalities.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0226573;5.7;5.4;5.2;;31846498;e0226573;;;

Published by BMJ.Objectives In 2017, Myanmar implemented routine viral load (VL) monitoring for assessing the response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among people living with HIV (PLHIV). The performance of routine VL testing and implementation challenges has not yet assessed. We aimed to determine the uptake of VL testing and factors associated with it among PLHIV initiated on ART during 2017 in ART clinics of Yangon region and to explore the implementation challenges as perceived by the healthcare providers. Design An explanatory mixed-methods study was conducted. The quantitative component was a cohort study, and the qualitative part was a descriptive study with in-depth interviews. Setting Six ART clinics operated by AIDS/sexually transmitted infection teams under the National AIDS Programme. Primary outcome measures (1) The proportion who underwent VL testing by 30 March 2019 and the proportion with virological suppression (plasma VL <1000 copies/mL); (2) association between patient characteristics and not tested' was assessed using log binomial regression and (3) qualitative codes on implementation challenges. Results Of the 567 PLHIV started on ART, 498 (87.8%) retained in care for more than 6 months and were eligible for VL testing. 288 (57.8%, 95% CI: 53.3% to 62.2%) PLHIV underwent VL testing, of which 263 (91.3%, 95% CI: 87.1% to 94.4%) had virological suppression. PLHIV with WHO clinical stage 4 had significantly higher rates of not being tested' for VL. Collection of sample for VL testing only twice a month, difficulties in sample collection and transportation, limited trained workforce, wage loss and out-of-pocket expenditure for patients due to added visits were major implementation challenges. Conclusions The VL test uptake was low, with only six out of ten PLHIV tested. The VL testing uptake needs to be improved by strengthening sample collection and transportation, adopting point-of-care VL tests, increasing trained workforce, providing compensation to patients for wage loss and travel costs for additional visits.";https://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-032678;3.7;3.6;3.5;;31796489;e032678;;;

A ferrocene based metel-organic framework, named FMOF was synthesized using ZrCl4 and 1,1-ferrocene-dicarboxylic acid (FDC) through a tradition solvothermal method. The as-prepared FMOF featured nanosheet morphology with a thickness of ca.10 nm and lateral size of ca. 500 nm. Since the Fe2+ in the FDC ligands could act as a reducing agent, this FMOF was employed for the in-situ reduction of Pd2+ and the Pd nanoparticles (NPs) with a diameter of ca. 3.5 nm were successfully obtained and loaded on the surface of FMOF. Though this facile approach Pd/FMOF with Pd loading amount of 3.39 wt% was obtained and no obvious change of the crystal structure was found after the reduction process for FMOF. It was found that the Pd/FMOF performed good catalytic activity in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with conversion of 89.3%, and the catalytic activity maintained well after 3 cycles.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002228601930986X;3.0;3.4;4.0;S002228601930986X;;126895;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S002228601930986X;;

The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DTG (DTG + TDF/3TC) compared to efavirenz (EFV + TDF/3TC) in treatment-naive and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r + TDF/3TC) in first-line ART failure HIV-1-infected patients in China. Methods: A dynamic Markov model comprising of 5 response states and 6 CD4+ count-based health states was used. Efficacy, estimated as probability of virologic suppression (HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL) at 48 weeks, was obtained from a published network meta-analysis for ART-naive patients and from the DAWNING study for patients failing first-line ART. Baseline cohort characteristics were informed using DTG phase 3 studies and the DAWNING study data, respectively. Health state utilities were derived from DTG phase 3 studies. A 5-year cost-effectiveness analyses was conducted using the societal perspective. Outcomes were quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs), life-years (LYs), incremental cost per QALYs (ICER). Results: The viral suppression rates for DTG + TDF/3TC were higher than EFV + TDF/3TC (75.3% vs 64.0%) in treatment-naive and LPV/r + TDF/3TC (74.8% vs 58.4%) in first-line ART failure patients. This resulted in higher QALYs for DTG + TDF/3TC in treatment-naive (4.232 vs 4.227) and first-line failure settings (4.224 vs 4.221). Total discounted cost for DTG + TDF/3TC patients (RMB 219.259 in treatment-naive and RMB 238,746 in first-line failures) were lower than comparators (EFV + TDF/3TC:RMB 221,605; LPV/r + TDF/3TC:RMB 244,364), thereby DTG dominated in both settings. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated the probability of DTG + TDF/3TC being cost effective was 98.2% in treatment-naive setting and 100% in first-line failure setting at a willingness to pay threshold of RMB 100,000/QALY. Conclusions: With lower costs, higher response rates and higher QALYs, DTG + TDF/3TC can be considered as a cost-effective alternative for treatment naive and first-line failure patients in China.";https://resource-allocation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12962-019-0195-2;3.2;1.8;1.9;;;26;;;

To date, the radiologic findings of this tumor in multiphase computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging have not been described. CASE SUMMARY Patient 1 is a 31-year-old Chinese female, whose complaining incidentally coincided with the finding of multiple liver masses. In the local hospital, an abdominal enhanced CT found two hypo-dense solid lesions, with heterogeneous sustained hypoenhancement, in the upper segment of the liver's right posterior lobe. In our hospital, enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with hepatocyte-specific contrast agents showed a similar enhanced pattern of lesions with patchy hyperintensity in the hepatobiliary phase (HBP). The patient underwent surgery and recovered well. The final pathology confirmed an IPTlike FDC tumor. No recurrence was found on the regular re-examination. Patient 2 is a 48-year-old Chinese male admitted to our hospital for a huge unexpected hepatic lesion. A dynamic enhanced abdominal CT revealed a huge heterogeneous enhanced solid tumor in the right lobe of the liver with a size of 100 mm × 80 mm, which showed a heterogeneous sustained hypoenhancement. In addition, enlarged lymph nodes were found in the hilum of the liver. This patient underwent a hepatic lobectomy and lymph node dissection. The final pathology confirmed an IPT-like FDC tumor. No recurrence was found upon regular re-examination. CONCLUSION When a hepatic tumor shows heterogeneous sustained hypoenhancement with a patchy enhancement during HBP, an IPT-like FDC tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis.;https://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/full/v25/i45/6693.htm;7.3;6.7;7.1;;31832007;;;;

Little is known about the predictors of treatment failure in the study area. Therefore; more factors that can be risk for first line ART failure have to identified to make the patients stay on first line ART for long times. Consequently, the aim of this study was to identify determinants of first line ART treatment failure among patients on ART at St. Luke referral hospital and Tulubolo General Hospital, 2019. Methods: A 1:2 un-matched case-control study was conducted among adult patients on active follow up. One new group variables was formed as group 1 for cases and group 0 for controls and then data was entered in to Epi data version 3 and exported to STATA SE version 14 for analysis. From binary logistic regression variables with p value 0.25 were a candidate for multiple logistic regression. At the end variables with a p-value 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Result: A total of 350 (117 cases and 233 controls) patients were participated in the study. Starting ART after 2 years of being confirmed HIV positive (AOR = 3.82 95% CI 1.37,10.6), nevirapine (NVP) based initial ART (AOR = 2.77,95%CI 1.22,6.28) having history of lost to follow up (AOR 3.66,95%CI 1.44,9.27) and base line opportunistic infection (AOR = 1.97,95%CI 1.06,3.63), staying on first line ART for greater than 5 years (AOR = 3.42,95%CI 1.63,7.19) and CD4 less than100cell/ul (AOR = 2.72,95%CI 1.46,5.07) were independent determinants of first line ART treatment failure. Conclusion: Lost to follow up, staying on first line ART for greater than 5 years, presence of opportunistic infections, NVP based NNRT, late initiation of ART are determinant factors for first line ART treatment failure. The concerned bodies have to focus and act on those identified factors to maintain the patient on first line ART.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-019-4651-6;4.5;4.3;4.1;;31795955;1024;;;

PURPOSE: To evaluate efficacy, tolerability, and safety of PF tafluprost/timolol FC in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and ocular hypertension (OH) who couldn't tolerate or gave insufficient response to topical beta-adrenoblockers or prostaglandin analogue monotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The prospective multicenter European VISIONARY study (EUPAS22204) included 87 patients from 7 ophthalmological centers in Russia with mean age of 63.9±11.8. Primary endpoint was mean IOP change at month 6. The patients were monitored for changes in in the severity of ocular signs and symptoms. RESULTS: Statistically significant (p<0.0001) reduction of mean IOP from baseline was seen at all study visits: 7.3±5.17 mmHg at week 4, 7.4±5.40 mmHg at week 12, and 7.1±5.10 mmHg at month 6. By month 6, IOP has decreased by 20; 25; 30 and 35% from baseline in 77.0%, 58.9%, 43.7%, and 31.0% of study patients, respectively. Conjunctival hyperemia was significantly reduced at all study visits. Significant reductions in dry eye symptoms (p<0.0010), irritation (p=0.0204) and itching (p=0.0010) were also observed. After 6 months on PF tafluprost/timolol FC, 85.7% of patients described it as easy or very easy to tolerate. CONCLUSION: In clinical practice, PF tafluprost/timolol FC provided statistically significant IOP reductions in patients with POAG and OH insufficiently controlled by or intolerant to monotherapy with topical beta-adrenoblockers or a prostaglandin analogue. The highest IOP reduction was seen at week 4 and was maintained over the 6-month study period.

The management of this parasitic disease is challenged by ever increasing drug resistance. This study, investigated the therapeutic efficacy, tolerability and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ), used as first-line drugs to treat uncomplicated malaria in Lambaréné, Gabon. Methods: A non-randomized clinical trial was conducted between October 2017 and March 2018 to assess safety, clinical and parasitological efficacy of fixed-doses of AL and AS-AQ administered to treat uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children aged from 6 months to 12 years. After 50 children were treated with AL, another 50 children received ASAQ. The 2009 World Health Organization protocol for monitoring of the efficacy of antimalarial drugs was followed. Molecular markers msp1 and msp2 were used to differentiate recrudescence and reinfection. For the investigation of artemisinin resistant markers, gene mutations in Pfk13 were screened. Results: Per-protocol analysis on day 28 showed a PCR corrected cure rate of 97% (95% CI 86-100) and 95% (95% CI 84-99) for AL and AS-AQ, respectively. The most frequent adverse event in both groups was asthenia. No mutations in the kelch-13 gene associated with artemisinin resistance were identified. All participants had completed microscopic parasite clearance by day 3 post-treatment. Conclusion: This study showed that AL and AS-AQ remain efficacious, well-tolerated, and are safe to treat uncomplicated malaria in children from Lambaréné.

In GEMINI trials in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve HIV-1-infected adults, treatment with dolutegravir plus lamivudine provided rapid and sustained virological suppression and was noninferior to dolutegravir plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine at 48 weeks, irrespective of baseline patient or disease characteristics. Virological suppression was sustained at 96 weeks in these ongoing trials. In patients with HIV-1 with sustained virological suppression on their current tenofovir alafenamide (AF)-based ART regimen ( 3 drugs), switching to treatment with dolutegravir/lamivudine was noninferior to continuing on a tenofovir AF-based regimen at 48 weeks in the ongoing TANGO trial. No resistance mutations to dolutegravir or lamivudine were detected in patients who met criteria for confirmed virological withdrawal in GEMINI and TANGO trials. Hence, the dolutegravir/lamivudine STR is an effective, generally well tolerated and convenient initial and subsequent ART option for adolescents and adults with HIV-1 infection with no known or suspected resistance to the INSTI class or lamivudine.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40265-019-01247-1;9.4;9.2;9.6;;31865558;;;;

We pooled data from the PINNACLE-1,-2, and-4 studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the dual bronchodilator fixed-dose combination glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate metered dose inhaler (GFF MDI), formulated using co-suspension delivery technology, in GOLD category A patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD. Materials and Methods: PINNACLE-1,-2, and-4 were Phase III, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter studies (NCT01854645, NCT01854658, and NCT02343458). Patients received 24 weeks’ treatment with GFF MDI 18/9.6 µg, glycopyrrolate (GP) MDI 18 µg, formoterol fumarate (FF) MDI 9.6 µg, or placebo MDI twice daily. GOLD category A patients were identified based on a COPD Assessment Test score of <10 and exacerbation history in the previous year (none/one not requiring hospitalization). Endpoints evaluated were change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), peak change from baseline in FEV1 within 2 hrs post-dose, and adverse events (AEs). Results: The pooled intent-to-treat population comprised 729 GOLD category A patients. GFF MDI significantly improved morning pre-dose trough FEV1 at Week 24 versus GP MDI, FF MDI, and placebo MDI (least squares mean [LSM] differences 54 mL, 62 mL, and 188 mL, respectively; all p0.0053), and peak FEV1 at Week 24 versus GP MDI, FF MDI, and placebo MDI (LSM differences 124 mL, 104 mL, and 307 mL, respectively; all p<0.0001). Improvements over 24 weeks were comparable to at Week 24. The AE profile of GFF MDI in GOLD category A patients was similar to monocomponents and placebo MDI. Conclusion: GFF MDI significantly improved lung function versus monocomponents and placebo MDI in GOLD category A patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD, with no unexpected safety findings.";https://www.dovepress.com/glycopyrrolateformoterol-fumarate-metered-dose-inhaler-improves-lung-f-peer-reviewed-article-COPD;4.5;4.7;4.9;;32021148;;;;

We therefore performed an analysis of Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) data from two large, long-term, controlled clinical COPD trials to investigate whether tiotropium/olodaterol increased the risk of cardiac arrhythmia and mean heart rate. Methods: We analyzed Holter ECG data from a representative subset of patients (N=506) from the two pooled replicate studies (TONADO 1 and 2) assessing tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg therapy versus tiotropium 5 µg or olodaterol 5 µg monotherapy, inhaled once daily (two single inhalations) using the Respimat® Soft Mist™ inhaler device. Additionally, major adverse cardiac events (MACE) with tiotropium/olodaterol were assessed versus the respective monotherapies. Results: After 12 weeks of treatment, there was no difference in the number of patients who had an increase or decrease from baseline in 24-hour supraventricular premature beats or ventricular premature beats between tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg combination therapy and its monocomponents. Compared with baseline, a small but statistically significant increase in adjusted mean heart rate was observed for tiotropium 5 µg (+1.6 beats per minute [bpm]; P=0.0010), but no difference was observed for olodaterol 5 µg (+0.3 bpm; P=0.2778) or tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg (–0.1 bpm; P=0.4607). MACE and fatal MACE were limited to 1 to 3 patients across treatment groups. Conclusion: Compared with the compounds given as monotherapy, treatment with tiotro-pium/olodaterol fixed-dose combination therapy is not associated with medically relevant or statistically significant effects on arrhythmia as assessed by Holter ECG. Based on these findings, there is no evidence to assume a clinically relevant impact on cardiac function from dual tiotropium/olodaterol treatment.

Statins are known to effectively reduce not only low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level but also death and nonfatal myocardial infarction due to coronary heart disease. The risk for CVD from atherogenic dyslipidemia persists when elevated triglyceride (TG) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are not controlled with statin therapy. Therefore, statin/fenofibrate combination therapy is more effective in reducing CVD risk. Here, we assessed the efficacy and tolerability of pitavastatin/fenofibrate combination therapy in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and a high risk for CVD. Methods: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, therapeutic-confirmatory clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of fixed-dose combination therapy with pitavastatin/fenofibrate 2/160 mg in Korean patients with a high risk for CVD and a controlled LDL-C level (<100 mg/dL) and a TG level of 150–500 mg/dL after a run-in period with pitavastatin 2 mg alone. In the 8-week main study, 347 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive pitavastatin 2 mg with or without fenofibrate 160 mg after a run-in period. In the extension study, patients with controlled LDL-C and non–HDL-C (<130 mg/dL) levels were included after the completion of the main study. All participants in the extension study received the pitavastatin/fenofibrate combination therapy for 16 weeks for the assessment of the tolerability of long-term treatment. Findings: The difference in the mean percentage change in non–HDL-C from baseline to week 8 between the combination therapy and monotherapy groups was 12.45% (95% CI, 17.18 to 7.72), and the combination therapy was associated with a greater reduction in non-HDL-C. The changes in lipid profile, including apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein from baseline to weeks 4 and 8 were statistically significant with combination therapy compared to monotherapy at all time points. Furthermore, the rates of achievement of non–HDL-C and apolipoprotein B targets at week 8 in the combination therapy and monotherapy groups were 88.30% versus 77.98% (P = 0.0110) and 78.94% versus 68.45% (P = 0.0021), respectively. The combination therapy was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of statin monotherapy. Implications: In these Korean patients with mixed dyslipidemia and a high risk for CVD, combination therapy with pitavastatin/fenofibrate was associated with a greater reduction in non–HDL-C compared with that with pitavastatin monotherapy, and a significantly improvement in other lipid levels. Moreover, the combination therapy was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of statin monotherapy. Therefore, pitavastatin/fenofibrate combination therapy could be effective and well tolerated in patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in quality of life (QOL), medication adherence, and satisfaction after switch from the existing drug to the combination drug. In addition, we analyzed the correlation between the above-mentioned variables and the stratified demographic and medical data of the patients. Methods: A prospective, noninterventional, observational study was conducted in 30 hospitals between May 2014 and July 2016. In total, 2,308 patients with osteoarthritis, 99 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and 76 patients with ankylosing spondylitis were enrolled. Demographic information (age, sex, body mass index [BMI], alcohol consumption, and smoking) and medical information (type of arthritis, duration of disease, and comorbidities) were collected via a self-administered questionnaire. Patients were observed for more than three months after switching to the combination drug. Data on the QOL (EuroQoL 5-Dimension questionnaire [EQ-5D questionnaire]), medication adherence (Morisky Medication Adherence Scale [MMAS]), and satisfaction were collected at the first and last visits. Results: A total of 2,483 patients enrolled at 30 hospitals completed the questionnaire. After the switch to the combination drug, the mean EQ-5D score improved from 0.72 ± 0.17 to 0.79 ± 0.14 (p < 0.001), and significant improvement was associated with female sex (p = 0.016), shorter disease duration (p < 0.001), and absence of comorbidities (p < 0.001). The mean MMAS score was 6.38 ± 1.77, indicating medium adherence. Satisfaction was significantly higher in female patients (p < 0.001), in patients with a shorter disease duration (p < 0.001), osteoarthritis (p = 0.003), and no comorbidities (p < 0.001). Serious drug-related adverse effects did not occur. Conclusions: The overall QOL was improved with medium adherence after the switch to the combination drug. On the basis of the analysis of stratified data, sex, age, drinking, smoking, disease duration, comorbidities, and BMI might be associated with QOL, satisfaction, and adherence.;https://ecios.org/DOIx.php?id=10.4055/cios.2020.12.1.86;2.2;2.1;2.4;;32117543;;;;

Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.Introduction: Intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy is a promising treatment option for gastric cancer (GC) with peritoneal metastasis (PM). Recently, superiority of IP administration of paclitaxel (PTX) combined with S-1 and intravenous PTX over conventional systemic chemotherapy was suggested in a phase III study, although the difference in overall survival did not reach statistical significance in the primary analysis. Thus, attempts to combine IP PTX with other systemic therapies with higher efficacy are warranted. We designed a new regimen combining IP PTX with S-1 plus cisplatin (SP), which is regarded as the standard first-line treatment for metastatic GC in Japan, and subsequently carried out a dose-escalation study. Methods: The combination was a 5-weekly regimen. IP PTX was to be administered on days 1, 8, and 22 with an initial dose of 15 mg/m2 at level 1 and 20 mg/m2 at level 2. S-1 was to be administered orally at a fixed dose of 80 mg/m2 b.i.d. for 21 days followed by a -14-day rest. Cisplatin was to be administered intravenously at a dose of 60 mg/m2 on day 8. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were defined as grade 4 leukopenia, grade 3 (G3) febrile neutropenia, G3 thrombocytopenia, and G3 nonhematological toxicity. Results: A total of 9 patients with macroscopic PM were enrolled. No DLTs were observed among the 3 patients at level 1 and 6 patients at level 2. No adverse events or technical problems associated with the IP administration were observed. Consequently, the maximum-tolerated dose was not reached, and the dose for further clinical trials of IP PTX was determined as 20 mg/m2. As for efficacy, peritoneal lavage cytology turned negative after the first course in 4 of 7 patients who had positive cytology before treatment. Conclusion: The present study determined the dose for further clinical trials of IP PTX to be 20 mg/m2, when combined with the 5-weekly SP regimen.;https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/502484;3.9;3.8;4.5;;31487733;;;;

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of generic sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) in a real-life clinical experience. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, patients with chronic HCV infection who referred to Middle East Liver Diseases (MELD) Center were included. Based on the patients’ condition, they were treated with SOF/LDV fixed-dose combination with or without ribavirin (RBV) for 12 or 24 weeks. Results: A total of 30 (M/F: 19/11) patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection with a mean age of 49.8 years were treated with generic SOF/LDV with (9 patients) or without (11 patients) RBV for 12 (27 patients) or 24 (3 patients) weeks. Ten (33.3%) had cirrhosis and 13 (43.3%) with a previous history of treatment with interferon (IFN)-based regimens. Among the 30 patients, 26 (86.7%, 95% CI=70.3%-94.7%) achieved a rapid virologic response, 30 (100%, 95% CI=88.7%-100%) achieved the end of treatment response and 30 (100%, 95% CI=88.7%-100%) achieved a sustained virologic response. No severe treatment adverse event was observed however, 6 (20%) patients experienced mild to moderate adverse events. Conclusion: The treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection with generic SOF/LDV found to be safe and effective even in patients with cirrhosis and previous history of treatment with IFN-based treatments.;http://caspjim.com/article-1-1576-en.html;2.1;2.1;2.0;;;;;;

The adoption of new drugs in therapy, although they can guarantee an improvement in patient’s quality of life, can meet obstacles when it involves an increase in costs. We decided to compare the costs and benefits of the new saxagliptin and dapagliflozin combination versus traditional therapies. Bodyweight loss and the sharp reduction in hypoglycemic episodes were the 2 main clinical outcomes that emerged from registered studies of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin compared with the sulfonylureas. These results, combined with the good cardiovascular risk profile, led to develop a cost-utility analysis. We aimed to show the economic value of this new association therapy. We carried out a cost-utility analysis from the Italian National Healthcare System (NHS) perspective, focused on direct costs related to the treatment and management of main diabetes complications. Utility scores adopted have been measured based on the patient’s perception of weight changes. In light of the better durability profile of saxagliptin/dapagliflozin compared with gliclazide, we also considered a simulation scenario to assess the impact on costs of switching to basal insulin, starting from gliclazide and the fixed combination, respectively, and based on the related probabilities to switch. To assess the robustness of the results, a 1-way sensitivity analysis was performed by changing the main parameters by ±20%. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the results was tested considering the addition of a percent discount, because the purchase costs of drugs are usually subject to hidden discounts. We calculated the total direct annual cost per patient of saxagliptin/dapagliflozin versus gliclazide and insulin glargine for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus not achieving glycemic control on metformin plus saxagliptin alone, dapagliflozin alone, or gliclazide at a lower dosage. Total treatment costs have been obtained adding the direct cost of the drug, needles, glycemic self-monitoring, hypoglycemic events, cardiovascular complications, and effect on consumption of other drugs. The total direct cost of saxagliptin/dapagliflozin fixed dose combination was €414.62 higher than gliclazide (€1.067.72 vs €653.10), and greater than basal insulin, with a difference of €166.99 (€1067.72 vs €900.72). Despite the higher annual direct total cost, the additional cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, compared with gliclazide, has been €11 517, and €4639, when compared with insulin glargine in the base-case scenario, and the robustness of the results has been shown in the sensitivity analysis. The results of our cost-utility analysis, expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, were fully compliant with the threshold adopted for Italy. Then, saxagliptin/dapagliflozin can be considered a cost-effective oral hypoglycemic agent. The positive effect of this drug on the quality of life, induced by the bodyweight loss, has allowed this outcome, despite the higher annual cost per patient, mainly determined by the drug purchase cost.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1178632920929982;0;0;0;;;;;;

Results: The pooled dataset consisted of 2948, 2589, and 3331 FF, UMEC, and VI observations from 714, 622, and 817 patients with COPD, respectively. There were 41%, 13%, and 21% of observations below the quantification limit for FF, UMEC, and VI, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of FF, UMEC, and VI were all adequately described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption. The following covariates were statistically significant, but none were considered to be clinically relevant. For FF, Japanese heritage and FF/VI treatment on apparent inhaled clearance (CL/F) with FF CL/F 35% lower in patients of Japanese heritage across all treatments and FF CL/F 42% higher in patients with COPD following FF/VI administration. This is in line with the product label. For UMEC, weight, age, and smoking status on CL/F and weight on apparent volume of distribution (V2/F) with every 10% increase in age from 60 years of age leading to approximately a 6% decrease in UMEC CL/F and every 10% increase in weight from 70 kg leading to approximately a 6% increase in UMEC CL/F and approximately an 8% increase in UMEC V2/F. For a subject with COPD who smoked, UMEC CL/F was 28% higher. For VI, weight on CL/F and smoking status on V2/F with an approximately 4% increase in VI CL/F for every 10% increase in weight from 70 kg, and for a subject with COPD who smoked, VI V2/F was 46% higher. The majority of these covariates have been previously identified in historical analyses. None of these effects were clinically relevant in terms of systemic exposures and do not warrant dose adjustment. Conclusions: All FF, UMEC, and VI plasma concentrations were well interspersed with historical data and were all adequately described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption. There were no clinically relevant differences in FF, UMEC, or VI systemic exposures when administered as FF/UMEC/VI, FF/VI + UMEC, or the dual combinations FF/VI and/or UMEC/VI.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40262-019-00794-w;8.5;8.2;8.8;;31321713;;;;

The aim was to study medication adherence in patients with stable coronary artery disease in primary care. Material and methods: The study was conducted in a primary care setting of Moscow. Demography, medical history, pharmacotherapy data were obtained retrospectively from 386 coronary patients’ medical records. Medication adherence was measured by 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8). A statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics V16.0. Results and discussion: According to the results from MMAS-8, 188 (48.7%) coronary patients had high medication adherence, 135 (35.0%) – moderate, and 63 (16.3%) – low. By the dichotomous interpretation: 48.7% (n = 188) – were adherent, 51.3% (n = 198) – were non-adherent. These groups were similar in gender distribution, age, and medical history profile (p > 0.1 for all variables). Smokers prevailed in the non-adherent group (13.6 vs. 5.3%; p = 0.009). Both groups were equally prescribed beta-blockers, antiplatelets, and statins (p > 0.1 for all). Use of fixed dose combinations (11.7 vs. 5.6%; p = 0.048) and the number of pills taken (mean 5.64 ± 1.52 vs. 5.99 ± 1.62; p = 0.029) were associated with better adherence. Higher values of total cholesterol (mean 5.2 ± 1.4 vs. 4.7 ± 1.2 mmol/L; p < 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (mean 2.9 ± 1.2 vs. 2.4 ± 0.9 mmol/L; p < 0.001) were revealed in non-adherents. Subjects with suboptimal adherence visited general practitioners more frequently (median 5 vs. 3 visits; p = 0,003). Conclusion: Medication non-adherence in coronary outpatients exceeded 50%. High adherence was associated with more frequent use of fixed dose combinations and fewer pills taken by patient. Smoking and poorer control of blood lipids prevailed in non-adherents, who also caused higher load on general practitioners.";https://rrpharmacology.pensoft.net/article/54130/;0;0;0;;;;;;

All rights reserved.Aim. To study the opinion of primary care physicians and hypertensive (HTN) outpatients with different compliance rate on factors preventing effective antihypertensive therapy (AHT). Material and methods. Primary care physicians and HTN outpatients were questioned. Questionnaires for physicians and patients included informative and survey parts, with a list of possible factors aggravated adherence to treatment. The assessment was carried out using visual analogue scale. The patient questionnaire also included questions about AHT and the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8). The calculation was carried out with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results. The survey involved 298 physicians and 517 patients. Among patients, about 1% had a high compliance rate, 34% — moderate, 65% — low. In all groups, AHT did not significantly differ and was characterized by a low frequency of prescribing fixed-dose combinations (27,1%). According to physicians, the most significant and equiva-lent are the economic aspects of treatment — 7,9±2,1 (95% CI: 7,51-8,38), the need for lifestyle change — 7,9±2,4 (95% CI: 7,37-8,38) and, to a slightly lesser extent, psychological aspects 6,8±2,2 (95% CI: 5,43-6,43). The economic aspects of treatment and need for lifestyle change were also most significant factors according to patients with high (8,8±1,8 (95% CI: 7,23-10,37) and 8,4±1,7 (95% CI: 6,93-9,87), respectively) and low (95% CI: 6,4±3,0 (5,65-7,07) and 6,2±2,8 (95% CI: 5,5-6,82) respectively) compliance rates. For patients with moderate compliance rate, the most significant and almost equivalent factors were the need for lifestyle change — 5,6±3,3 (95% CI: 4,53-6,71), the need for regular visits — 5,6±3,1 (95% CI: 4,53-6,58) and the need for self-management — 5,6±2,8 (95% CI: 4,63-6,48). Conclusion. The results obtained make it possible to forecast the compliance rate of patients with HTN, and, therefore, direct more efforts to those with a low rate, thereby increasing the effectiveness of AHT.;https://russjcardiol.elpub.ru/jour/article/view/3776;0.3;0.4;0.5;;;3776;;;

The goal of pharmacotherapy is to achieve the target HbA1c and fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels to avoid disease complications. Objective: To evaluate the profile of T2DM patients on different antidiabetic treatment regimens and the factors leading to dose escalation in these patients. Methods: A prospective descriptive study was conducted at Kasturba Medical College Hospital, Mangalore, a tertiary care teaching hospital, over a period of one year. The study population comprised of patients with T2DM for 5 years. The demographic and clinical data were collected during the baseline and follow-up visits. Results: Of the 119 patients studied, 59.7% were males; 32.8% were 65 years of age. A significant decrease in the fasting blood glucose (FBG) on follow-up was seen (p = 0.028) in patients on sulfonylurea and metformin combination. A significant decrease in the glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was seen in patients on sulfonylurea with metformin and pioglitazone (p = 0.011); sulfonylurea with metformin, pioglitazone, and sitagliptin (p = 0.026); and metformin with insulin (p = 0.001).

Objective: The specificity of the established methods was inspected by analysing mixtures of cited drugs in the existence of the alkali-induced degradation product. Methods: These methods were employed either on scanned zero-order absorption spectra using absorbance subtraction, dual wavelength and Q-absorbance ratio or the amplitudes of the ratio spectra of zero-order absorption spectra like amplitude modulation and by derivative techniques to the ratio spectra as a derivative ratio method. In addition, the absorbance of the recovered zero-order absorption spectra was applied by successive ratio subtraction coupled with constant multiplication. Finally, the pathway depends on the amplitudes of the derivative spectra, successive derivative subtraction coupled with constant multiplication. The ranges of linearity were (1-12µg/mL) for chlordiazepoxide and (3-12µg/mL) for clidinium bromide. Results: The outcomes achieved by the prospective methods were in consent with those of the official and reported methods when statistically compared using student’s t test, F-test and one-way ANOVA where no significant difference was detected with suitable precision, proving the absence of any important difference in accuracy and precision between them. They were confirmed in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. Conclusion: The established methods can be considered as alternative methods for the routine determination of this fixed dose combination with minimum sample preparation.;http://www.eurekaselect.com/166388/article;1.2;1.1;1.3;;;;;;

The PINNACLE-4 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of GFF MDI in patients with moder-ate-to-very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from Asia, Europe, and the USA. This article presents the results from the China subpopulation of PINNACLE-4. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase III study (NCT02343458), patients received GFF MDI 18/9.6 µg, glycopyrrolate (GP) MDI 18 µg, formoterol fumarate (FF) MDI 9.6 µg, or placebo MDI (all twice daily) for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough forced expira-tory volume in 1 second at Week 24. Secondary lung function endpoints and patient-reported outcome measures were also assessed. Safety was monitored throughout the study. Results: Overall, 466 patients from China were included in the intent-to-treat population (mean age 63.6 years, 95.7% male). Treatment with GFF MDI improved the primary endpoint compared to GP MDI, FF MDI, and placebo MDI (least squares mean differences: 98, 104, and 173 mL, respectively; all P0.0001). GFF MDI also improved daily total symptom scores and time to first clinically important deterioration versus monocomponents and placebo MDI, and Transition Dyspnea Index focal score versus placebo MDI. Rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were similar across the active treatment groups and slightly higher in the placebo MDI group. Conclusion: GFF MDI improved lung function and daily symptoms versus monocomponents and placebo MDI and improved dyspnea versus placebo MDI. All treatments were well tolerated with no unexpected safety findings. Efficacy and safety results were generally consistent with the global PINNACLE-4 population, supporting the use of GFF MDI in patients with COPD from China.";https://www.dovepress.com/efficacy-and-safety-of-glycopyrrolateformoterol-fumarate-metered-dose--peer-reviewed-article-COPD;4.5;4.7;4.9;;32021143;;;;

In this study, we aimed to study the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of these two formulations, in both fasted and fed children, including patients younger than 6 years of age. Methods: Previously published data from one PK study and one PK/PD study in children aged between 6 and 16 years were combined with a new PK/PD study in children aged between 6 months and 8 years, and analysed using population PK/PD modelling. Simulations were performed to further explore the relative bioavailability of both formulations and evaluate current dosing strategies. Results: The complex absorption behaviour of the lyophilizate was modelled using a double input, linked to a one-compartmental model with linear elimination and an indirect response model linking dDAVP concentration to produced urine volume and osmolality. The final model described the observed data well and elucidated the complexity of bioequivalence and therapeutic equivalence of the two formulations. Simulations showed that current dosing regimens using a fixed dose of lyophilizate 120 g is not adequate for children, assuming children to be in the fed state when taking dDAVP. A new age- and weight-based dosing regimen was suggested and was shown to lead to improved, better tailored effects. Conclusions: Bioequivalence and therapeutic equivalence data of two formulations of the same drug in adults cannot be readily extrapolated to children. This study shows the importance of well-designed paediatric clinical trials and how they can be analysed using mixed-effects modelling to make clinically relevant inferences. A follow-up clinical trial testing the proposed dDAVP dosing regimen should be performed.

This study aimed to describe the epidemiologic features of the entire spectrum of histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms, including clinicopathological variables and patient outcomes. Materials and Methods: We comprehensively reviewed 274 patients who were diagnosed with histiocytic and dendritic neo-plasms at Severance Hospital, Seoul, South Korea between 1995 and 2018. Results: The most common neoplasm was Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), followed by dermal xanthogranuloma. Among non-LCH sarcomas, histiocytic sarcoma (HS) showed a relatively high prevalence, followed by follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS). Disseminated juvenile xanthogranuloma (DJG), Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD), indeterminate dendritic cell tumor (IDCT), and interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma (IDCS) rarely occurred. Generally, these tumors presented in childhood, al-though the non-LCH sarcoma (HS/FDCS/IDCS/IDCT) group of tumors and ECD occurred in late adulthood. Multiorgan involve-ment and advanced Ann-Arbor stage, as well as recurrence and death of disease, were not uncommon. The non-LCH sarcoma group had the worst overall survival, compared to the DJG, ECD, and LCH groups. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms exhibit heterogeneous epidemiologic characteristics and that some patients may have unfavorable outcomes, especially those with non-LCH sarcoma.;https://eymj.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3349/ymj.2020.61.9.774;3.0;3.0;3.4;;32882761;;;;

The objective of this study was to describe the effectiveness and safety of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker in a single-tablet combination in patients with hypertension, a heart rate higher than 70 beats/min, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study was conducted in Turkey as a prospective, noninterventional, observational study. At 22 clinical sites, the data of 200 patients with hypertension were used for efficacy analysis; however, 262 patients received at least one dose of trandolapril/verapamil fixed-dose combination at two dose strengths. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate, PR interval, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), and albumin/creatinine ratios were recorded during 8 weeks of treatment. With treatment, the mean (±SD) SBP that was recorded as 162.8 (±14.642) mm Hg at baseline was reduced to 131.7±11.1 mm Hg at week 8 (p<0.05). Similarly, the mean DBP was reduced from 93.76±9.16 mm Hg to 77.6±7.6 mm Hg (p<0.001). Following 8 weeks of treatment, SBP and DBP values were reduced below 140 mm Hg and 90 mm Hg in most patients (81.5%), respectively. The mean heart rate as evaluated using electrocardiography measurements was reduced to 78.25 beats/min at week 8 as compared with baseline during trandolapril/verapamil single-pill combination treatment (p<0.001). Treatment with trandolapril and verapamil was well tolerated over 8 weeks with no unexpected safety signals. In conclusion, the single-pill combination of trandolapril and verapamil was considered effective in reducing and controlling blood pressure in patients with hypertension and T2DM. There was a significant improvement in HbA1c and ACR levels in a smaller subgroup of the patient cohort. The trandolapril/verapamil combination was evaluated as being safe and well-tolerated following a treatment period of 8 weeks.

Pregnancy has been shown to influence the pharmacokinetics of a number of different antimalarial drugs. This might lead to an under-exposure in these patients which could increase the risk of treatment failure and the development of drug resistance. The study aim was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of artesunate and dihydroartemisinin in pregnant and non-pregnant patients using a population modelling approach. Methods: Twenty-four women in their second and third trimester of pregnancy and twenty-four paired non-pregnant women, all with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, were enrolled in this study. Treatment was a fixed-dose combination of oral artesunate and mefloquine once daily for three days. Frequent blood samples were collected and concentration-time data for artesunate and dihydroartemisinin were analysed simultaneously using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. Results: Artesunate pharmacokinetics was best described by a transit-compartment absorption model followed by a one-compartment disposition model under the assumption of complete in vivo conversion of artesunate into dihydroartemisinin. Dihydroartemisinin pharmacokinetics was best described by a one-compartment disposition model with first-order elimination. Pregnant women had a 21% higher elimination clearance of dihydroartemisinin, compared to non-pregnant women resulting in proportionally lower drug exposure. In addition, initial parasitaemia and liver enzyme levels (alanine aminotransferase) were found to affect the relative bioavailability of artesunate. Conclusions: Results presented here show a substantially lower drug exposure to the antimalarial drug dihydroartemisinin during pregnancy after standard oral treatment of artesunate and mefloquine. This might result in an increased risk of treatment failure and drug resistance development especially in low transmission settings where relative immunity is lower.

Objectives: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate sustained virologic response rates resulting from a fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir (SOF) and velpatasvir (VEL), also known as Epclusa® (Gilead, Forster City, CA) in patients with HCV genotype 3. Methods: In this study, we searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for relevant studies from inception un-til May 3rd, 2019. The primary outcome measure used was the rate of the sustained virological response at week-12 (SVR12) post-treatment. The heterogeneity of results was evaluated, and influence analyses were performed using the R software. In addition, publication bias was assessed using the funnel and Egger tests. Results: Eleven trials (n = 2246 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled SVR12 rate in patients with HCV-genotype 3 (GT3) was 94.6% with a random effect model by inverse method (95% Cl 92.5%-96.1%, I2 = 53%, P = 0.02). A subpopulation analysis indicated that the pooled SVR12 rates were 96.3% in GT3 patients with compensated cirrhosis and 94.0% in GT3 patients with prior anti-HCV treatment. Moreover, influence analysis suggested that the most significant source of heterogeneities resulted from one trial, which enrolled most patients with HCV subtype 3b. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis showed a high SVR12 rate of SOF/VEL in GT3 patients regardless of compensated cirrhosis the status and/or a history of previous interferon-based treatments. These results highlight the need for more trials investigating the effectiveness of the SOF/VEL regimen in patients with HCV subtype 3b.;https://sites.kowsarpub.com/hepatmon/articles/98798.html;3.6;3.4;3.8;;;e98798;;;

No systematic evaluation of its implementation has been done so far in a tertiary care setting in urban India. Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted at National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases, Delhi in 2018-19. Missed doses, average adherence and treatment outcomes were compared across 99DOTS dashboard and TB treatment card. In-depth interviews of patients and health care providers were conducted to explore the implementation challenges and benefits. Results: Median of missed doses recorded during intensive and continuation phase were 56 and 68 respectively in 99DOTS as compared to 0 in the TB Treatment card (p<0.0001). Average adherence was observed to be 27% in 99DOTS versus 99% in the TB treatment card (p<0.0001). Technical issues like software malfunction, logistic difficulties such as missing custom envelops and patient's inability to give call were reported. Role clarity among ART and TB program staff was ambiguous, which contributed to poor information flow between them. Patient benefits such as reduced stigma, less travel costs and reduced work absenteeism were reported. Conclusion: Success of 99DOTS program under programmatic condition needs webtool stability, uninterrupted logistic supplies (envelops), training of staff and better coordination between TB and HIV program personnel. Despite the challenges in its implementation, the benefit of this tool in terms of greater convenience and reduced stigma for patients is encouraging.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0019570719303014;0.5;0.8;1.0;S0019570719303014;32192617;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0019570719303014;;

Most 505(b)(2) applications consist of changes to a previously approved drug product (ie, a new dosage form, new routes of administration, etc). Sponsors often face challenges determining the studies to be conducted to support approval via 505(b)(2) pathway. This 5-year (2012-2016) retrospective analysis reviewed approved 505(b)(2) NDAs available on the FDA website, to determine the nature of studies (preclinical, clinical pharmacology, and efficacy/safety) conducted for various types of submissions and to better understand the trends in terms of regulatory requirements. The database consisted of 226 NDAs. One hundred twelve of those 226 had complete FDA review information, with the following FDA submission classes being more prevalent: type 3, new dosage form; type 4, new combination; and type 5, new formulation or new manufacturer. Therefore, only these 112 NDAs were further examined as they could show trends in terms of the studies conducted for various types of applications.

Mil-lions of antibiotics are prescribed by physicians all over India. The main objective of the present study is to analyze the prescription pattern of the antibiotics given to the in-patients of our hospital and to access the rationality of these prescriptions given, using the World Health Organization’s core drug prescribing indicators. A total of 400 in-patients from Departments of Pedi-atrics, General Surgery, Obstetrics & Gynecology and Orthopedics were analyzed after screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria. The numbers of females are 248 (62%) and the males are 152 (38%) in a ratio of 1:1.63. 101 patients belonged to 40-60 years age group. The pattern of antibiotic usage in the Department of Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, General Surgery, Orthopedics was studied. The most common antibiotics prescribed were Cefo-taxime (44%), Amoxicillin(38%) and Cefazolin (38%, 24%) in Departments of Pediatrics, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Surgery and Orthopedics respectively. The total numbers of drugs prescribed were 1441 out of which 612 were antibiotics (43.09%). The number of antibiotics per prescription was 1.53. The average number of drugs prescribed per prescription was 3.6. The percentage of encounters with injections was 26.48%. The percentage of drugs prescribed by generic name is 36.2%. The percentage of drugs from the Essential Drug List was 92%. The percentage of fixed-dose combinations of antibiotics prescribed was 14.54%. Hence, in our study, though most of the drugs are given from the Essential List of Medicines, drugs given by a generic name is low. Physicians can be encouraged to prescribe more drugs by generic name. To conclude, antibiotic stewardship interventions have to be implemented to promote the judicious use of antibiotics to prevent adverse consequences.;https://pharmascope.org/ijrps/article/view/2155;0.2;0.2;0.2;;;;;;

The purpose of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of the fixed-dose combination tablet of elbasvir/grazoprevir in healthy Chinese participants. Patient and Methods: In this Phase I, single-site, open-label, 3-period study in healthy Chinese adults, participants received a single tablet of elbasvir 50 mg/grazoprevir 100 mg, followed by blood sampling for up to 96 hrs (http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn/ CTR20160034; Protocol PN071). Participants then received 1 tablet daily for 10 days, followed by a minimum 10-day washout, after which participants received a single dose of 2 tablets (elbasvir 100 mg/grazoprevir 200 mg). Elbasvir and grazoprevir PK were assessed following single and multiple doses. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated. Results: Twelve participants (50% male) were enrolled in and completed the study. Following single-dose oral administration of elbasvir 50 mg/grazoprevir 100 mg or elbasvir 100 mg/ grazoprevir 200 mg, the median Tmax was 3–4 hrs and elimination half-life was 18 hrs (elbasvir) and 30 hrs (grazoprevir).

However, it must be established which patients benefit most from it compared to other treatments. Areas covered: We critically review the literature to determine, if possible, the real role of triple therapy in the treatment of COPD. We have identified studies from several databases and selected the information thought to be more significant. Expert opinion: It is still unclear whether and when addition of an ICS to the LAMA/LABA combination provides real additional clinical value, regardless of a preventive effect on exacerbations. There are many doubts about the value of the blood eosinophil count as a valid biomarker to predict AECOPD risk and the clinical response to ICS, also because no association was found in observational studies. In any case, before starting a therapy involving ICS, the risk factors for the development of pneumonia must always be evaluated. Adding a LAMA to an ICS/LABA combination seems to be less problematic. However, each LABA/LAMA combination has a specific efficacy/safety profile that needs to be considered for personalized therapy in COPD even in the context of triple therapy.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17512433.2020.1787830;4.1;4.2;5.1;;32597259;;;;

Studies have shown that citicoline and benfotiamine can improve memory and learning through different mechanism of actions. The aim of this study was to compare the individual effects of benfotiamine (100, 200, 300 mg/kg) and citicoline (50, 100, 250, 500 mg/kg, gavage) and their co-administration on memory impairments in diabetic mice. Methods: Diabetes was induced by a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ, 140 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and benfotiamine and/or citicoline were administered for three weeks. Memory was evaluated using the object recognition task (ORT) and passive avoidance test (PAT). Results: Results from ORT shows that citicoline at 50, 100, 250, and 500 mg/kg and benfotiamine at 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg and their combination (benfotiamine at 100 mg/kg added to citicoline at 50, 100, and 250 mg/kg) are equally effective in reversing the memory loss induced by STZ (p  0.001). PAT results demonstrate that citicoline at 100, 250, and 500 mg/kg and benfotiamine at above doses did not improve the latency time when administered separately, but benfotiamine at a fixed dose of 100 mg/kg in the presence of citicoline at 50, 100, and 250 mg/kg increased the latency time and improved memory significantly. Conclusion: In conclusion, in PAT, co-administration of benfotiamine and citicoline was more effective than either alone in improving memory. Regarding ORT, although benfotiamine added to citicoline improved memory notably, the difference between combination therapy and single-drug therapy was not considerable.;http://www.cpn.or.kr/journal/view.html?doi=10.9758/cpn.2020.18.1.81;2.8;3.6;3.4;;;;;;

Results: GFF MDI improved change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 over Weeks 12–24 versus GP MDI, FF MDI, and placebo MDI (least squares mean [LSM] differences [95% confidence interval]: 69 [8–131], 60 [–1 to 121], and 275 [180–370] mL, respectively). GFF MDI numerically improved Transition Dyspnea Index focal score and change from baseline in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score versus placebo MDI (LSM differences 0.19 and 3.78, respectively). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 4.5% of patients in any treatment group. Conclusions: GFF MDI improved lung function versus monocomponents and placebo MDI in the Japan subpopulation of PINNACLE-4. The efficacy and safety results were generally consistent with those of the global study population, supporting the use of GFF MDI in Japanese patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2212534520300976;3.1;3.2;3.1;S2212534520300976;;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2212534520300976;;

So far, this strategy has been scarcely explored. The aims of this study were to investigate the stability and bioavailability of RIF after combination of a very fast release matrix of RIF with a sustained delivery system of INH. A series of INH-alginic acid complexes (AA-INH) was obtained and characterized. Independent and sequential release profile of AA-INH at biorrelevant media of pH 1.20 and 6.80 was explored. In addition, AA-INH was combined with a RIF-carboxymethylcellulose very fast release complex (CMC-RIF) obtained previously and subjected to acid dissolution assays to evaluate RIF acid stability and determine RIF and INH dissolution efficiencies. Finally, a pharmacokinetic study in dogs was carried out. The AA-INH was easily obtained in solid-state. Their characterization revealed its ionic nature, with a loading capacity of around 30%. The dissolution efficiencies (15 min) confirmed release segregation in acid media with 7.8 and 65.6% for AA-INH and CMC-RIF, respectively. INH release rate from the AA-INH system was slow in acid media and increased in simulated intestinal media. The complete release of INH was achieved after 2 h in simulated intestinal media in the sequential release experiments. The acid degradation of RIF was significantly reduced (36.7%) when both systems were combined and oral administration to dogs revealed a 42% increase in RIF bioavailability. In conclusion, CMC-RIF and AA-INH may be useful for the formulation of a site-specific solid dosage form to overcome some of the main obstacles in tuberculosis treatment.

However, to date, no studies have investigated the direct switch from LABA/ICS to LAMA/LABA therapy—instead of switching to triple therapy— in a prospective, real-world, non-interventional setting. Methods: EVELUT® (NCT03954132) is an ongoing, prospective, open-label, multicenter, non-interventional study comparing the once-daily fixed-dose combination of tiotropium and olodaterol (tio/olo) versus any triple therapy (LAMA/LABA/ICS) in patients with COPD who are symptomatic despite LABA/ICS maintenance therapy. Patients with acute or frequent COPD exacerbations are excluded from the study. Participants will receive LABA/ICS maintenance treatment until Visit 1, followed by switching of treatment to tio/ olo or LAMA/LABA/ICS. The primary endpoints are changes in modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) and COPD Assessment Test (CAT®) scores after approximately 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints are change in the patients’ general condition according to the Physician’s Global Evaluation score, the proportion of responders with a change in mMRC score of 1 and in CAT® score of 2, and patient satisfaction with the inhaler and therapy. The study is expected to enroll approximately 900 patients. Conclusion: EVELUT results are expected to add to the current real-world evidence informing therapeutic decisions for COPD in everyday clinical practice.

Materials and Methods: RMT analysis was conducted on the baseline SGRQ data from five multi-national, Phase III randomized trials investigating a fixed-dose combination of a long-acting 2-agonist and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist in COPD patients. Analysis was performed for the SGRQ “Symptoms” and “Activity” domains. An exploratory analysis was also conducted using the different specific symptoms as defined in the reconceptualiza-tion of the SGRQ “Symptoms” domain. Differential item functioning (DIF) analysis was performed for geographical regions on the “Activity” domain, in order to explore cross-cultural validity of the SGRQ. Results: Overall, the SGRQ “Activity” domain showed good measurement property, but two items (“Sitting or lying still making feel breathless” and “Playing sports or game making feel breathless”) showed very high fit residuals. The SGRQ “Symptoms” domain demonstrated good targeting; however, two items showed disordered thresholds (“Coughed” and “Brought up phlegm”). In an exploratory RMT analysis, measures for “Cough and Sputum”, “Breathing difficulties” or “Wheezing attacks” showed unsatisfactory measurement properties with poor reliability (person separation index = 0.35, 0.66 and 0.16, respectively) and targeting issues. The examination of cross-cultural performances of the SGRQ “Activity” items showed a great variability in the responses to these items in different global regions. Conclusion: Our results indicated that SGRQ may not be an appropriate instrument to measure symptom severity or activity limitations in patients with COPD. Hence, there is a need to develop other relevant PRO instruments that can be used in conjunction with SGRQ to provide a holistic assessment of the health status of COPD patients in clinical research.";https://www.dovepress.com/is-the-st-georgersquos-respiratory-questionnaire-an-appropriate-measur-peer-reviewed-article-COPD;4.5;4.7;4.9;;32982203;;;;

The modeling processes are described with the incorporation of the most dominating hydrodynamic effects such as added mass, lift and drag forces. The hydrodynamic coefficients are derived using strip theory and are adjusted according to dynamical similarity. A fuzzy decoupling controller (FDC) is proposed for an autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) which consists of two subsystems, an underwater vehicle and a manipulator. The proposed controller uses a fuzzy algorithm (FA) to adaptively tune the gain matrix of the error function (EF). The EF is described by the integral sliding surface function. This technique allows the off-diagonal elements developed for decoupling the system to be incorporated in the gain matrix. Tracing the FA and EF back to the principle of feedback linearization, one further obtains evidence about the decoupling and stability of the system. Moreover, a desired trajectory with the consideration of the dynamic coupling of the AUV is designed to reduce the thruster forces and manipulator's torques. This technique provides high performance in terms of tracking error norms and expended energy norms. A major contribution of this study is that it adopts the off-diagonal elements to exploit the dynamic coupling between the degrees of freedom of the subsystem and the dynamic coupling between the two subsystems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique in the presence of parameter uncertainties and external disturbances.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8963978/;2.4;3.1;3.9;;;8963978;;;

The aim of this paper is to determine the flow duration curve for downstream of Sungai Perak using minimum and maximum flow. The flow-duration curve describes the variability of the streamflow and is useful for determining dependable flow which information is required for planning of water resources and hydropower projects, designing a drainage system and flood control studies. In this study, the development of FDC is solely based on the available discharge data of the selected streamflow stations. The plot between percentage times of discharge against discharge was calculated using the probability equation to determine whether the percentage time of discharge is equal or exceeded. From the calculation, the results show that the significant differences in the discharge as the percentage of the time change. Two crucial stations were discussed which are Sungai Perak at Jambatan Iskandar station located at the main river and Sungai Pelus at Kampung Lintang station located at Sungai Perak main tributaries. The results shows that, half the time the flow in the river is at least 200 m3/s, and 90% of the time not less than 100 m3/s while the daily average flow at Kg Lintang was at least 20 m3/s that is 50% of the time, and 10 m3/s that is 90% of the time. It proves that the hydropower scheme gives a positive impact towards the downstream of the Chenderoh dam especially during the low flow where the flow is regulated by the discharge from the dam.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-981-15-1971-0_12;0;0;0.8;;;;;;

Clinical and Translational Science published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of the American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and OATP1B3 are involved in the disposition of a variety of commonly prescribed drugs. The evaluation of OATP1B1/1B3 inhibition potential by investigational drugs is of interest during clinical drug development due to various adverse events associated with increased exposures of their substrates. Regulatory guidance documents on the in vitro assessment of OATP1B1/1B3 inhibition potential are conservative with up to a third of predictions resulting in false positives. This work investigated the utility of OATP1B1/1B3 endogenous biomarkers, coproporphyrin (CP)-I and CP-III, to assess clinical inhibition of OATP1B1/1B3 and potentially eliminate the need for prospective clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies. Correlations between CP-I exposures and various OATP1B1 static DDI predictions were also evaluated. Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB) 300/120 mg fixed-dose combination is known to cause clinical inhibition of OATP1B1/1B3. In a clinical study evaluating the relative bioavailability of various formulations of GLE/PIB regimen, CP-I peak plasma concentration (Cmax) ratio and 0–16-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0–16) ratio relative to baseline increased with increasing GLE exposures, whereas there was a modest correlation between GLE exposure and CP-III Cmax ratio but no correlation with CP-III AUC0–16 ratio. This suggests that CP-I is superior to CP-III as an endogenous biomarker for evaluation of OATP1B1 inhibition. There was a significant correlation between CP-I and GLE Cmax (R2 = 0.65; P < 0.001) across individual subjects. Correlation analysis between GLE OATP1B1 R values and CP-I exposures (Cmax ratio and AUC0–16 ratio) suggests that an R value of > 3 can predict a biologically meaningful inhibition of OATP1B1 when the inhibitor clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are available.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cts.12888;2.4;4.2;4.9;;33048456;;;;

Methods: The data for this analysis were obtained from the 2014 China Health Insurance Association (CHIRA) database. The study included 64,576 patients aged 18 years who were prescribed one of the seven antihypertensive drugs included in the study in their first prescription in 2014 and were observed for 180 days. The medicine possession ratio (MPR) was calculated and taken as the measure of treatment adherence. MPR values <0.3, 0.3 to <0.5, 0.5 to <0.8, and 0.8 were considered treatment adherence very low, low, intermediate, and high, respectively. Descriptive statistics were used to present baseline data and treatment adherence rate. Multiple regression models were used to determine independent factors which can affect the treatment adherence rate. P-value <0.05 was considered significant. Results: Among the study antihypertensive drugs, amlodipine (33.98%), metoprolol (25.04%), and nifedipine (17.15%) were the frequently prescribed drugs. Nifedipine con-trolled release tablet had the highest MPR (0.61), followed by valsartan (0.53), valsartan/ amlodipine fixed-dose combination (0.50), indapamide (0.40), and amlodipine (0.39), whereas benazepril (0.27) and metoprolol (0.19) had the lowest MPR. Higher reimbursement ratio, regular tertiary hospitals visits, lower age, and lower daily medical cost positively affected treatment adherence, whereas longer duration of illness and higher daily average cost affected treatment adherence negatively. Conclusion: Our study assessed that prescribing more cost-effective, long-acting antihy-pertensive drugs, and raising the reimbursement ratio were associated with a better treatment adherence in Chinese patients with hypertension.;https://www.dovepress.com/analysis-of-adherence-to-antihypertensive-drugs-in-chinese-patients-wi-peer-reviewed-article-PPA;3.1;3.0;3.5;;;;;;

A mature GC comprises two functionally distinct compartments, a dark zone (DZ) and a light zone (LZ). DZ B cells undergo rapid clonal expansion during which their antibody genes are modified by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-mediated immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) gene hypermutation to generate a repertoire of antibody mutants with varying affinities to the immunizing antigen. With the help of other immune cells including T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), GC B cells with improved affinity to the antigen are selectively expanded and finally differentiate into memory B cell (MBC) and antibody-producing plasma cell (PC). In the LZ, GC B cells may also undergo AID-mediated class switch recombination. The germinal center reaction involves multiple immune cells and is tightly controlled by lineage-specific transcription factors. In this chapter, I will discuss the cellular and molecular signals, such as key transcription factors, that govern the formation and maintenance and GCs and the selection of GC B cells.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-981-15-3532-1_4;2.6;2.5;3.0;;32323268;;;;

However, due to the high difficulty of computer centers, research into optimizing the reliability of fault assessment, and prognosis through data analysis remains a prominent problem in this sector. The research explores fault diagnosis and prognosis in computer centers based on data mining methods such as Support Vector Computer (SVM) and Fine-tune Threshold and Adapted Softmax Layer (FTASL) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to design a systemic method and acquire analytical technology information in the Industry 4.0 era and the proposed system called SVM-FTASL-LSTM. This analysis is composed of two phases. Analysis of the data collected from CPS sensors, SVM is used to classify key factors that affect the data dimension to the less computational effort. The process engineers should be aware of which factors cause the system to malfunction. The second option is to set up a time series process focused on the FTASL-LSTM network for realtime analysis of the system. Before the computer collapses, the Fault Detection and Classification System (FDC) using SVM-FTASL-LSTM warn the engineer to change the computer settings to prevent the failure of the device.;http://jardcs.org/abstract.php?id=4799;0.1;0.2;0.4;;;;;;

The biochemical basis of this challenging reaction has recently been uncovered by the discovery of the UbiD cofactor, prenylated FMN (prFMN). This heavily modified flavin is synthesized by the flavin prenyltransferase UbiX, which catalyzes the non-metal dependent prenyl transfer from dimethylallyl(pyro)phosphate (DMAP(P)) to the flavin N5 and C6 positions, creating a fourth non-aromatic ring. Following prenylation, prFMN undergoes oxidative maturation to form the iminium species required for UbiD activity. prFMNiminium acts as a prostethic group and is bound via metal ion mediated interactions between UbiD and the prFMNiminium phosphate moiety. The modified isoalloxazine ring is place adjacent to the E(D)-R-E UbiD signature sequent motif. The fungal ferulic acid decarboxylase Fdc from Aspergillus niger has emerged as a UbiD-model system, and has yielded atomic level insight into the prFMNiminium mediated (de)carboxylation. A wealth of data now supports a mechanism reliant on reversible 1,3 dipolar cycloaddition between substrate and cofactor for this enzyme. This poses the intriguing question whether a similar mechanism is used by all UbiD enzymes, especially those that act as carboxylases on inherently more difficult substrates such as phenylphosphate or benzene/naphthalene. Indeed, considerable variability in terms of oligomerization, domain motion and active site structure is now reported for the UbiD family.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1874604720300160;2.5;3.2;4.1;S1874604720300160;32951834;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1874604720300160;true;9780128201374

Its role in CVD prevention has been extensively debated since the inception of this concept in 2003. There are two major kinds of polypills in clinical studies. The first is polypill that combines multiple low-dose medications for controlling only one CVD risk factor (such as high blood pressure or high serum cholesterol). These “single-purpose” polypills were mostly developed from original producers and have higher cost. The polypill that combines 3-4 pharmaceutical components, each with potential to reduce one major cardiovascular risk factors is “multi-purpose” or “cardiovascular” polypill. Using data from various clinical trials and from meta-analysis, Wald and Law claimed that this “cardiovascular” polypill when administered to every individual older than 55 years could reduce the incidence of CVD by more than 80%. Several short and intermediate to long-term studies with different cardiovascular polypills in phase II and III trials showed that they could provide better adherence, equivalent, or better risk factor control and quality of life among users as compared to usual care. One recently published randomized controlled clinical trial demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of a four-component polypill for both primary and secondary CVD prevention with acceptable number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one major cardiovascular event. Considering the slow achievement of CVD prevention in many poor- and middle-income Asian countries and also the need to further improve compliance of antihypertensive and lipid lowering medications in many high-income Asian countries, the concept of “cardiovascular polypill” could be very useful. With further support from ongoing polypill cardiovascular outcome trials, polypill could be the foundation of the population-based strategies for CVD prevention.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jch.14075;4.3;3.8;4.0;;;;;;

Little is known about health literacy in people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Indonesia. This study aimed to determine the level of health literacy among PLHIV in Indonesia and assess associations between sociodemographic variables, beliefs about medicines, stigma and health literacy. We conducted a cross-sectional study using questionnaires in PLHIV in Papua, Indonesia. The short version of the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA), Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) and HIV stigma scale as well as questions on demographic information were completed by the participants from two hospitals in Papua, Indonesia. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, we assessed the association between sociodemographic variables, stigma, beliefs about medicine and low health literacy. Overall, 331 participants were included, 62.0% female, 67.0% Papuans. A total of 38.5% of participants had low health literacy. PLHIV with multi-dose regimen were less likely to have low health literacy than those taking a fixed-dose combination (OR = 0.51; 95%CI = 0.32–0.82). PLHIV who had social support in medicine-taking were more likely to have low health literacy (OR = 1.78; 95%CI = 1.07–2.97). More awareness about medication overuse (OR = 1.17; 95%CI = 1.06–1.29) and medication harm (OR = 1.10; 95%CI = 1.01–1.20) were also associated with having low health literacy.

Despite the availability of effective antihypertensive medications, the control of hypertension at a global level is dismal, and consequently, the CVD burden continues to increase. In response, countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are implementing the HEARTS in the Americas, a community-based program that focuses on increasing hypertension control and CVD secondary prevention through risk factor mitigation. One key pillar is the implementation of a standardized hypertension treatment protocol supported by a small, high-quality formulary. This manuscript describes the methodology used by the HEARTS in the Americas program to implement a population-based standardized hypertension treatment protocol. It is rooted in a seamless transition from existing treatment practices to best practice using pharmacologic protocols built around a core set of ideal antihypertensive medications. In alignment with recent major hypertension guidelines, the HEARTS in the Americas protocols call for the rapid control of blood pressure, through the use of two antihypertensive medications, preferably in the form of a single pill, fixed-dose combination, in the initial treatment of hypertension. To date, the HEARTS in the Americas program has seen the improvement in antihypertensive medication formularies and the establishment of pharmacologic treatment protocols tailored to individual participating countries. This has translated to significant increases in hypertension control rates post-program implementation in these jurisdictions. Thus, the HEARTS in the Americas program could serve as a model, for not only the Americas Region but globally, and ultimately decrease the burden of CVD.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jch.14072;4.3;3.8;4.0;;;;;;

Two field experiments tested the effects of timing of applications of PL (8 Mg ha-1), RP (4 Mg ha-1) and microorganisms on soil organic matter pools, nutritional aspects and productive components of maize crop whole-plant silage. A second experiment evaluated the effects of RP doses (0, 3, 6 and 9 Mg ha-1) with a fixed dose of PL (8 Mg ha-1) on maize grains. Application of PL+RP decreased soil organic C, while RP alone increased the humin fraction C compared to the control. The MB-C in soil with PL and PL+RP+M increased in comparison to the control and the RP. The application of PL, based on an average of fall and spring, increased leaves + stem dry matter, while in the fall on its own, the highest cob yield was observed in the combination of PL+RP, showing synergistic effects.

Recent research suggests that particular structural changes in LE depend on the type of the associated antibody and occur in both mesiotemporal gray matter and white matter regions. However, it remains questionable to what degree conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-methods reflect alterations in white matter microstructure, since these methods do not account for crossing fibers. To address this methodological shortcoming, we applied fixel-based analysis as a novel technique modeling distinct fiber populations. For our study, 19 patients with LE associated with autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD-LE, mean age = 35.9 years, 11 females), 4 patients with LE associated with autoantibodies against leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1-LE, mean age = 63.3 years, 2 females), 5 patients with LE associated with contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2, mean age = 57.4, 0 females), 20 age- and gender-matched control patients with hippocampal sclerosis (19 GAD-LE control patients: mean age = 35.1 years, 11 females; 4 LGI1-LE control patients: mean age = 52.6 years, 2 females; 5 CASPR2-LE control patients: mean age = 42.7 years, 0 females; 10 patients are included in more than one group) and 33 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects (19 GAD-LE healthy controls: mean age = 34.6 years, 11 females; 8 LGI1-LE healthy controls: mean age = 57.0 years, 4 females, 10 CASPR2-LE healthy controls: mean age = 57.2 years, 0 females; 4 subjects are included in more than one group) underwent structural imaging and DTI at 3 T and neuropsychological testing. Patient images were oriented according to lateralization in EEG resulting in an affected and unaffected hemisphere. Fixel-based metrics fiber density (FD), fiber cross-section (FC), and fiber density and cross-section (FDC = FD · FC) were calculated to retrieve information about white matter integrity both on the micro- and the macroscale. As compared to healthy controls, patients with GAD-LE showed significantly (family-wise error-corrected, p < 0.05) lower FDC in the superior longitudinal fascicle bilaterally and in the isthmus of the corpus callosum. In CASPR2-LE, lower FDC in the superior longitudinal fascicle was only present in the affected hemisphere. In LGI1-LE, we did not find any white matter alteration of the superior longitudinal fascicle. In an explorative tract-based correlation analysis within the GAD-LE group, only a correlation between the left/right ratio of FC values of the superior longitudinal fascicle and verbal memory performance (R = 0.64, Holm-Bonferroni corrected p < 0.048) remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. Our results underscore the concept of LE as a disease comprising a broad and heterogeneous group of entities and contribute novel aspects to the pathomechanistic understanding of this disease that may strengthen the role of MRI in the diagnosis of LE.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2213158220301261;7.2;5.8;5.7;S2213158220301261;32623136;102289;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2213158220301261;;

Combining evidence-based drugs into a multicap could improve adherence in this population. No previous randomized trial assessing fixed-dose combination therapy has included patients early after a MI. We aimed to assess if a multicap containing four secondary prevention drugs increases adherence to treatment at 6 months after MI hospitalization. The study was designed as a randomized, parallel, open-label, controlled trial. Methods: Patients were randomized within 7 days of a MI to either multicap or control group. The multicap group received a capsule containing aspirin, atenolol, ramipril, and simvastatin. The control group received each drug in separate pills. The primary outcome was adherence at 6 months. We also measured blood pressure, heart rate, serum cholesterol levels, C-reactive protein, and platelet aggregation. Results: The study was stopped prematurely when 100 patients were included for futility. At 6 months, 92 (95.8%) patients were adherent to medical treatment: 98.0% in the multicap group and 93.5% in the control group [relative risk (RR) 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96–1.14; p = 0.347]. There were no differences between groups in systolic blood pressure (p = 0.662), diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.784), heart rate (p = 0.533), total cholesterol (p = 0.760), LDL-c (p = 0.979), C-reactive protein (p = 0.399), or in the proportion of patients with adequate platelet aggregation inhibition (p = 0.600). Conclusions: The study did not find any improvement in the adherence at 6 months after a MI with a multicap-based strategy (Multicap for Increase Adherence After Acute Myocardial Infarction; [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02271178]).";http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1753944720912071;2.5;3.3;3.3;;32186246;;;;

This study performs a subgroup analysis of the cohort from Spain in the IMPACT study. Materials and Methods: In IMPACT, a 52-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study (N = 10,355), patients 40 years of age with COPD and 1 moderate/severe exacerbations in the previous year were randomized 2:2:1 to once-daily FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 µg, FF/VI 100/25 µg or UMEC/VI 62.5/25 µg administered via the Ellipta inhaler. Here, we present a subgroup analysis of the 499 patients from Spain, included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population in the study. Endpoint assessed included exposure-adjusted rate of moderate and severe exacerbations. Results: In the Spain cohort, the exposure-adjusted rate of on-treatment moderate/severe COPD exacerbations per year for FF/UMEC/VI was 1.31 versus 1.43 and 1.57 for FF/VI and UMEC/VI, respectively. No new adverse events were identified. The results are consistent with those observed in the overall ITT study population. Conclusion: In the Spain cohort of the IMPACT study, patients receiving triple therapy with FF/UMEC/VI had a lower exposure-adjusted rate of exacerbations compared with FF/VI and UMEC/VI, similar to the overall population.

The present study of bupivacaine versus ropivacaine in equianalgesic doses was taken to explore the correlation between time to void urine and time for complete functional recovery. Material and Methods: In this double-blinded study fifty adult patients were assigned to two groups (bupivacaine/ropivacaine) according to alternate case allocation for receiving SA for lower abdominal, perineal, and lower limb surgeries, lasting less than 2 h. Statistical analysis was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach, using Mann-Whitney test for nonparametric data. Primary outcome data could not be obtained for 14 out of the 50 patients due to perioperative bladder catheterization. No patients were lost to follow-up. Results: Both the bupivacaine and ropivacaine groups were comparable in terms of ability to void (8.0 ± 2.3 vs. 7.0 ± 1.2 h;P > 0.05), modified Bromage scale after 4 h of SA (1.8 ± 1.3 vs. 2.6 ± 0.9 grade;P > 0.05), time to complete ambulation (6.7 ± 1.4 vs. 6.1 ± 1.0 h;P > 0.05), and time to negative Romberg test (6.1 ± 1.4 vs. 5.6 ± 0.9 h;P > 0.05), respectively. Strong positive correlations (r = 0.7-0.9) were found between time to void urine and time for complete ambulation. Conclusions: Time to void urine and recovery of motor functions were found comparable statistically when bupivacaine and ropivacaine were used in the doses of 12.5 and 18.75 mg, respectively, for SA. However, group ropivacaine required lesser time to void and no patient developed POUR. Time to void urine was more than the time for ambulation. This may indicate a need for 'selective spinal anesthesia' or adjuvant combination technique to accelerate the resolution of a block for ambulatory surgery.";http://www.joacp.org/text.asp?2020/36/1/94/278447;2.4;2.2;2.2;;;;;;

For protein drugs, only a few studies have been published to elucidate the challenges of stabilizing two proteins in one formulation. Here, we show a systematic study with the model proteins EPO and G-CSF, which differ significantly in their physicochemical properties. We apply several analytical methods to investigate the stability of the co-formulated proteins in the liquid and solid state. Forced degradation studies at elevated temperature indicate poor stability of the liquid co-formulations. Therefore, we use lyophilization as a stabilization strategy. Finally, we adopt an elegant approach, in which the proteins are lyophilized at pH 4.0 and reconstituted with buffer at pH 7.0 to obtain high monomer recovery and to preserve the protein structure of both EPO and G-CSF. After reconstitution, both proteins in co-formulation remain stable for the timespan until eventual application in patients. With this case study, we demonstrate how to overcome some challenges during the co-formulation of therapeutic proteins.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0928098719303446;5.7;5.4;6.6;S0928098719303446;31655209;105073;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0928098719303446;;

Six functional diversity indices, Functional Attribute Diversity (FAD), Modified Functional Attribute Diversity (MFAD), Functional diversity based on dendrogram (FDp and FDc), Functional evenness (FEve) and Functional divergence (FDiv), were employed to quantify functional diversity. The results showed a great change in functional diversity of the forest communities in the Wulingshan Reserve. Functional diversity was significantly correlated with altitude and disturbance gradients. A non-linear “humped” change pattern along the altitudinal gradient and a non-linear or near linear decrease pattern along the disturbance intensity gradient were identified. Elevation and disturbance were the key factors influencing functional diversity. Functional diversity was closely related to species diversity in forests. The six common indices used were all effective and complementary to each other in functional diversity analysis in forests. MFAD, FEve and FDiv should be preferred in practice.;http://aloki.hu/pdf/1803_46254636.pdf;0.8;0.8;0.8;;;;;;

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between belief and adherence to the therapeutic regimens in pharmaceutical care models for tuberculosis patients in primary healthcare centres. This research is a quantitative cross sectional analytic study at Perak Timur, Gading, and Manukan Kulon primary healthcare centres in the Surabaya area. Data collection for tuberculosis patients was carried out at the primary healthcare centres for 2 months (from October to November 2017). The independent variable is belief in drug therapy which consists of the sub-variables of perceived threats, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and perceptions of self-efficacy. The dependent variable was adherence to therapeutic regimens with indicators of the right dosage, right frequency, right interval, right time to take medication, and right duration of therapy. Out of a total of 61 respondents, 32 (52.46%) were found adherent; taking the combination fixed dose antituberculosis drug and 29 (47.54%) patients did not adhere. Analysis of data with the Spearman Test showed p = 0.004 (p < 0.05) which means there is a correlation between belief and adherence to therapeutic regimens. Our findings showed a significant relationship between belief and adherence to therapeutic regimens in pharmaceutical care for tuberculosis patients attending primary healthcare centres in Surabaya, Indonesia.";http://tjnpr.org/viewarticle.aspx?articleid=714;0;0;0.2;;;;;;

In 2018, contamination of generic ARBs with probable carcinogenic nitrosamines resulted in more than 30 recalls. The impact of such a huge recall has never been explored in Europe. We analyzed the utilization of valsartan, all ARBs, and other alternative antihypertensive drugs in Germany. We used our database of anonymized dispensing data from >80% of community pharmacies at the expense of the statutory health insurance (SHI) funds from January 2017 to December 2019. We analyzed 290.8 million prescriptions, including all oral mono- and fixed-dose combinations of ARBs and plausible alternatives, i.e. ACE inhibitors (ACEi), beta-blockers (BB), and calcium channel blockers (CCB). Utilization was calculated by defined daily doses per 1000 SHI-insured persons per day (DID). Valsartan use decreased substantially after the recalls in July 2018 from 39.0 to 14.2 DID (64%) in the second quarter of 2019 and to 16.9 DID (57%) in the fourth quarter of 2019. Simultaneously, the use of alternative ARBs increased from 77.7 DID in the second quarter of 2018 to 121.9 DID (+57%) in the fourth quarter of 2019, mainly due to an increase of candesartan dispensing to 99.8 DID (+73%). There were no changes in the utilization of ACEi, BB, or CCB. The majority of recalled generic valsartan products were replaced by other ARBs, predominantly candesartan, despite documented drug shortages. In contrast to previous safety warnings/recalls, our data do not suggest an under-prescription of antihypertensives during this period.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41371-020-00425-z;5.2;4.6;4.4;;;;;;

To further improve the antitumor efficacy for gastric cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis, we added nab-paclitaxel to the established SOX regimen (NSOX). Nab-paclitaxel (nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel) has effective transferability to tumor tissues and strong antitumor effects for peritoneal metastasis. We performed a phase 1 study of this regimen to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RD) in patients with gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis. Methods: The NSOX regimen involved 21-day cycles with escalated doses of nab-paclitaxel (50 [level 1] to 80 [level 4] mg/m2 on days 1 and 8) and fixed doses of oxaliplatin (100 mg/m2 on day 1) and S-1 (80 mg/m 2 day for 2 weeks). Results: Six patients with gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis were enrolled. The MTD was determined to be dose level 2, as 2 of 3 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), grade 4 non-hematological toxicities. One patient experienced acute myocardial infarction, and the other patient developed jejunal perforation. There were no treatment-related deaths. No patients experienced DLTs, so the RD was determined to be dose level 1. Conclusions: The NSOX regimen was shown to be a tolerable regimen and may be a promising triplet therapy for patients with gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis.;https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/509396;3.9;3.8;4.5;;32877909;;;;

We aimed to describe drug exposure at steady state as well as the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of rifampicin (RIF), isoniazid (INH) and pyrazinamide (PZA) in Chinese TB patients. Methods: A prospective multicentre PK study of RIF, INH and PZA was conducted in China between January 2015 and December 2017. Six blood samples were collected from each subject for drug concentration measurement. Nonlinear mixed effect analyses were used to develop population PK models. Results: In total, 217 patients were included. Positive correlations between body weight, clearance and volume of distribution were identified for RIF and PZA, whereas body weight only influenced clearance for INH. In addition, males had higher RIF clearance and thus lower RIF exposure than women. Acetylator status was significantly associated with INH clearance as INH exposure in intermediate and fast acetylators was significantly lower than in slow acetylators, especially in low-weight bands. Simulations also showed significantly lower drug exposures in low-weight bands for all three drugs. Patients weighing <38 kg were respectively exposed to 30.4%, 45.9% and 18.0% lower area under the concentration-time curve of RIF, INH and PZA than those weighing 70 kg. Higher doses by addition of one fixed-dose combination tablet or 150 mg INH were simulated and found to be effective in improving INH drug exposures, especially in low-weight bands. Conclusion: PK variability of first-line anti-TB drugs is common in Chinese TB patients. The developed population PK models can be used to optimize drug exposures in Chinese patients. Moreover, standard dosing needs to be adjusted to increase target attainment.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bcp.14522;7.1;7.0;6.9;;;;;;

Objectives: Compare efficacy and safety of IGlarLixi and IDegAsp (as intensification from basal insulin), by indirect comparison of phase III trials, in the absence of head-to-head trials. Study eligibility criteria: Studies comparing treatment intensification by once-daily IDegAsp or IGlarLixi to basal insulin. Data were extracted from two trials (BOOST: Intensify-Basal and LixiLan-L) retained for analysis. Synthesis methods: Treatments were compared in terms of estimated treatment difference (ETD) in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting and postprandial plasma glucose (FPG and PPG) change from baseline; in addition to hypoglycaemia incidence and weight changes. Results: In a fixed-effect model examining HbA1c control, IGlarLixi was more effective than IDegAsp in reducing HbA1c (ETD 0.53%, P < 0.0001]), PPG (ETD 2.65%, P < 0.0001), and body weight (ETD 1.73 kg, P < 0.0001).

All rights reserved.Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder. It is one of the most serious socio-economic crises in the world and is considered to be a serious threat to mankind. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia. The onset is very rapid and when it becomes uncontrolled causes stupor, coma, and even death due to ketoacidosis. The pharmacological management of diabetes is very important to control the glycemic levels. It is proven that the administration of extensive insulin therapy has improved glycemic control and its remissions. This has also reduced the mortality and morbidity of the patients. Insulin lispro is a recombinant analog similar to that of human insulin. It was found to have the greatest postprandial glycemic control. The fixed-dose combinations of different oral hypoglycemic agents are widely preferred nowadays as it reduces the economic burden of the patient. Recent advances include statin therapy with ezetimibe, daily insulin injections, noninvasive glucose sensing techniques, the role of mitochondrial miRNAs in the pathogenesis of diabetes, the role of extracts in the treatment and nanotechnology in diabetes. The non-pharmacological management of diabetes includes Mindfulness Based Stress reduction (MBSR) therapy which includes lifestyle modifications and counseling and the effect of oxidative stress in the development of insulin resistance on diabetes. The treatment modalities which we reviewed in this study have proven to have good patient outcomes. There is still a need for the development of more treatment strategies with oral hypoglycemic agents.;None;0.2;0.3;0.8;;;;;;

Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.This study sought to determine the dominant circulating human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype and associated drug resistance mutations in Ghana.This cross-sectional study was conducted with archived samples collected from patients who received care at 2 hospitals in Ghana from 2014 to 2016. Blood samples were earlier processed into plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and stored at -80 °C. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from the archived plasma. Two HIV-1 genes; protease and reverse transcriptase, were amplified, sequenced using gene-specific primers and analyzed for subtype and drug resistance mutations using the Stanford HIV Database.Of 16 patient samples successfully sequenced, we identified the predominance of HIV-1 subtype CRF02-AG (11/16, 68%). Subtypes G (2/16, 13%), dual CRF02-AG/G (2/16, 13%), and CRF01-AE (1/16, 6%) were also observed. Major nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance mutations, M184I/V, D67N, T215F, and K70R/E were found. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance mutations, K103N, Y181C, V90I, F227L, and V106A were also prevalent. Additionally, and at a lower level, protease inhibitor (PI)-resistance mutations, M46I, I54 V, V82A, L90 M, and I471 V, were also present in the sequences from antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced individuals. Two NRTI-associated drug resistance mutations (DRMs) (D67N and T69N) were present in sequences from 1 ART-naive individual.HIV-1 subtype CRF02-AG was most frequently detected in this study thus confirming earlier reports of dominance of this subtype in the West-African sub-region and Ghana in particular. The detection of these drug resistance mutations in individuals on first-line regimen composed of NRTI and NNRTI is an indication of prolonged drug exposure without viral load monitoring. Routine viral load monitoring is necessary for early detection of virologic failure and drug resistance testing will inform appropriate choice of regimens for such patients.";https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/MD.0000000000018777;2.1;2.7;2.7;;32049783;e18777;;;

According to clinical recommendations of the Russian Medical Society for Arterial Hypertension 2010–2019, the use of two and more component drugs improves the compliance of patients to treatment. The purpose of this study was a comparative analysis of preferences in the usage of combined antihypertensive drugs in ten regions of the Far Eastern Federal District (FSD). Materials and Methods: Intra-group analysis of data on the sale of antihypertensive drugs in pharmacy organizations (162 drugstores) for the period 2018 was carried out in the 10 regions of the FSD. The sample is uneven due to the difference in total number of drugstores in the regions. The sample was random. Pharmacies were in urban and rural areas. The total purchase of all defined daily doses of all antihypertensive drugs was taken as 100%. Then, fixed-dose combinations were selected. The share of each drug in the sales structure was then calculated. Kruskal–Wallis criterion was used for determining the differences in the structure of acquisition of drugs between the regions. The Spearman’s rank correlation and factor analysis were used for determining the correlation between the drug’s acquisition structure and the FSD region. Results: Two-component drugs are most in demand in the Amur region – 15.2% and Zabaykalsky Krai – 12.3%, and the lowest demand in the Sakhalin region – 5.25% and Magadan region – 6.5%. The largest sales indicators of three-component drugs were observed in the Zabaykalsky Krai – 1.2% and the Republic of Buryatia – 1.0%. The most acquired combinations were atenolol+chlorthalidone, valsartan+amlodipine, losartan+hydro-chlorothiazide, perindopril/lisinopril/ramipril+amlodipine, perindopril+indapamide. Conclusion: Group leaders may vary depending on the region, which is due to the preferences of medical specialists. However, the differences are not significant, which proves the unity of approaches to combined drug therapy of arterial hypertension.;https://www.dovepress.com/analysis-of-preferences-in-the-use-of-fixed-doses-combinations-antihyp-peer-reviewed-article-CEOR;2.8;2.5;2.6;;;;;;

Eighteen healthy subjects enrolled and completed the study. No significant difference in the maximum concentration (Cmax) and the area the under plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) for amlodipine and AUC of atorvastatin was detected following combination versus monotherapy. Cmax of atorvastatin decreased slightly but clinically not relevantly when given in combination.

Seasonal drying and wetting are stressful for the spawning and breeding activities of aquatic faunas in those stretches. In this work, an integrated hydrological and hydrodynamic modelling study is carried out to estimate the ecological flow requirement in Bhogdoi river, India, a southern tributary of Brahmaputra river. Escalating anthropogenic activities continuously deteriorating the flow scenarios and degrading the aquatic health in the study area. The consequence of hydrological alterations is addressed in terms of the environmental flow regimes derived from FDCA (flow duration curve analysis) and FDC (flow duration curve) shifting method. Flow rates under different environmental management scenarios are evaluated and based on the analysis it is found that under the existing basin condition a minimum flow of 13.42–18 cumec is required for the river ecosystem. The flow depth and the current speed corresponding to the observed maximum flow and the ecological flow rates are computed from a two-dimensional hydrodynamic routing model.

Methods: A Markov model with a five year cycle was constructed. Two decision models incorporating strict and more relaxed adherence definitions estimated quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and health-care costs for single pill fixed triple combination therapy vs. free-drug combination therapy. Results: When the strict adherence measurement criteria were applied, the total QALYs loss and cost/patient were 6.38 QALYs, $486,026.20 for the single pill triple combination therapy and 8.64 QALYs, $406,405.26 for the free combination therapy. ICER for single pill combination therapy compared to free combination therapy was 33,826.46/QALY. When the relaxed adherence measurement criteria were applied, the total QALYs loss and cost/patient were 8.09 QALYs, $493,404.26 for the single pill triple combination therapy and 8.76 QALYs, $436,415.14 for the free combination therapy. ICER for single pill combination compared with free combination therapy was 84,932.26. Conclusion: This study suggested that single pill triple combination therapy was cost-effective in comparison with free combination therapy under a willingness to pay threshold of 50,000 when the strict adherence measurement criteria was applied.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14737167.2020.1800457;3.0;3.0;3.3;;32703040;;;;

The current study aimed at assessing the prevalence of HIV-1 DRMs among naïve and treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients in Iran. Methods From April 2013 to September 2018, the HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase genes were amplified and sequenced in plasma specimens of 60 newly diagnosed antiretroviralnaive individuals and 46 participants receiving antiretroviral therapies (ARTs) for at least six months with an HIV viral load of more than 1000 IU/mL to determine the HIV-1 DRMs and subtypes. Results Among the 60 treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected participants, 8.3% were infected with HIV-1 variants with surveillance DRMs (SDRMs). The SDRMs, D67N and D67E, belonged to the NRTIs class in two patients and K103N and V106A belonged to the NNRTIs class in three patients. The phylogenetic analysis showed that 91.7% of the subjects were infected with subtype CRF35_AD, followed by subtype B (5.0%) and CRF01_AE (3.3%). Among the 46 ART-experienced participants, 33 (71.7%) carried HIV-1 variants with SDRMs (9.1% against PIs, 78.8% against NRTIs, and 100% against NNRTIs). M46I and I47V were the most common mutations for PIs, M184V was the most common mutation for the NRTIs, and K103N/S was the most common mutation for NNRTIs. Phylogenetic analysis of the polymerase region showed that all of the 46 HIV-1-infected patients who failed on ART carried CRF35_AD. Conclusions The moderate prevalence of SDRMs (8.3%) in treatment-naïve and ART-failed (77.1%) Iranian patients with HIV-1-infection emphasizes the need for systematic viral load monitoring, expanding drug resistance testing, carefully surveilling individuals on ART regimens, and facilitating access to new antiretrovirals by health authorities.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229275;5.7;5.4;5.2;;32119691;e0229275;;;

To further evaluate the safety profile of this combination, the data from these trials were pooled and analyzed. Methods: This was a post-hoc pooled analysis of five randomized, double-blind, clinical trials of the empagliflozin/linagliptin fixed-dose combination. Data for adverse events and laboratory parameters were evaluated. Results: The analysis included 2895 patients: 1410, 1015, and 470 receiving the empagliflozin/linagliptin combination, empagliflozin monotherapy, and linagliptin monotherapy, respectively. Overall, the incidence of adverse events with the empagliflozin/linagliptin combination was similar to that with empagliflozin or linagliptin alone. Fewer than 2% of patients experienced hypoglycemia, and its incidence was similar across treatment groups. Genital infections occurred in more patients receiving empagliflozin/linagliptin (3.0%) or empagliflozin monotherapy (5.1%) than in those receiving linagliptin monotherapy (1.9%). No cases of Fournier’s gangrene, diabetic ketoacidosis, or pemphigoid occurred, and no clinically relevant mean changes in laboratory parameters were noted. Conclusion: The safety profile of the fixed-dose combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin was similar to the individual monotherapies.

The main neuropathological cause of the disease is the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Unfortunately, there is no curative treatment yet. The gold-standard of the treatment is levodopa (LD). During the course of the disease, motor complications develop, which postulates the addition of entacapone (ENT) to the dopaminergic medication. Previous studies have suggested that patients have a better quality of life when entacapone is added in a combination with LD. Areas covered: A systematic literature search was performed. Articles were identified through PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science, Ovid, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. The following search terms were used: ‘Levodopa’ AND ‘Carbidopa’ OR ‘Benserazide’ AND ‘Entacapone’. The search period was between 2000 and 2020. Twenty randomized and 10 non-randomized clinical trials (12,893 subjects) were included in the qualitative analysis. The systematic review was written in line with the PRISMA guideline. Expert opinion: ENT administered in combination with LD resulted in a better quality of life compared to separate tablets. Therefore, in PD patients where impaired motor performance develops and the application of entacapone is necessary, it is suggested to be administered in a single tablet form.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14656566.2020.1806237;5.7;5.6;4.9;;;;;;

Several AutoML methods have been proposed so far, but there is not a single one that really stands out. Furthermore, there is a lack of studies on the characteristics of the fitness landscape of AutoML search spaces. Such analysis may help to understand the performance of different optimization methods for AutoML and how to improve them. This paper adapts classic fitness landscape analysis measures to the context of AutoML. This is a challenging task, as AutoML search spaces include discrete, continuous, categorical and conditional hyperparameters. We propose an ML pipeline representation, a neighborhood definition and a distance metric between pipelines, and use them in the evaluation of the fitness distance correlation (FDC) and the neutrality ratio for a given AutoML search space. Results of FDC are counter-intuitive and require a more in-depth analysis of a range of search spaces. Results of neutrality, in turn, show a strong positive correlation between the mean neutrality ratio and the fitness value.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-43680-3_8;1.6;1.6;1.9;;;;;true;9783030436797

Methods: Patients were aged 40 years and had a COPD diagnosis (Practice Fusion system) and 1 prescription of LAMA/LABA FDC therapy, with an index date (first prescription) 1 May 2014-31 December 2017. For the HCRU analysis, patients had 2 claims from the Symphony Health database within 12 months before index. All analyses of outcomes relating to demographic and clinical characteristics, HCRU, and treatment patterns were descriptive. Results: Patients initiating LAMA/LABA FDCs (n=8224) had a mean age of 67.9 years, 52.8% were female, and mean BMI was 29.2 kg/m2. The most common comorbidities were cardiovascular disease (74.3%), hypertension (64.0%), and hyperlipidemia (45.6%). In the 12 months prior to index, 53.1% of patients had used inhaled therapy: 23.4% short-acting therapy only, 16.7% short-acting and maintenance therapy, and 13.1% maintenance therapy only. Amongst users of inhaled therapies, the pMDI was the most frequently used device (64.3%, n=2812/4370). Of 7050 patients included in the HCRU analysis, 79.8% had COPD- related costs; mean cost/patient was $4174. Mean COPD-related costs per patient for moderate and severe exacerbations were $910 and $23,208, respectively. Per-patient costs included $23,032 for inpatient visits, $2358 for emergency visits, $4432 for outpatient visits, and $1989 for pharmacy claims. Conclusion: This observational study is the first to describe the real-world demographic and clinical characteristics and HCRU of patients initiating LAMA/LABA FDC treatment in the USA. Patients were generally elderly and overweight, with comorbidities of CVD, hyperten- sion, and hyperlipidemia. Inpatient visits were the largest contributor to COPD-related costs per patient in the year prior to initiation of LAMA/LABA FDCs.";https://www.dovepress.com/patient-characteristics-and-healthcare-resource-utilization-among-pati-peer-reviewed-article-COPD;4.5;4.7;4.9;;32346288;;;;

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among patients with hypertension enrolled in a Texas MAP between January 2014 and December 2016. Antihypertensive combination therapy users were classified into three treatment groups: single-pill triple combination, fixed-dose dual combination plus a third agent, and free triple combination. Group differences were assessed using Chi-square tests for binary variables and Student’s t tests for continuous variables. Cox proportional hazards model was performed to assess the association between type of combination therapy and risk of cardiovascular-specific hospitalization adjusting for potential confounders. Results: A total of 10,836 triple combination users were identified. The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) hospitalization for the fixed-dose dual combination plus a third agent group [hazard ratio (HR) 3.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80–8.12] and for the free triple combination therapy group (HR 3.65, 95% CI 1.43–9.31) was significantly higher than for the single-pill triple combination group.

We aimed to evaluate the secure level of inactivation of original BSE transmissibility by dry-heating. Cattle tissues affected with BSE were subjected to dry-heat treatment for 20 min at various temperatures ranging from 150 to 1000 °C. To assess the inactivation effect, we conducted protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) and follicular dendritic cell (FDC) assays in transgenic mice expressing bovine prion protein genes. Under dry-heating at 600 °C or higher, BSE cattle tissues lost their transmissibility in transgenic mice. In contrast, transmissibility was detected in the cattle tissues treated at temperatures of 400 °C or lower through the FDC assay combined with PMCA.

One of the commonly observed hematologic manifestations in HIV-positive children is anemia and it has a multifactorial source. We intended to assess the prevalence, as well as its related factors of anemia among Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), experienced children. Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was employed at Hawassa comprehensive specialized hospital from February 15-June 15, 2018. Overall, 273 HAART-practiced children were included in the study. Socio-demographic variables and clinical data were collected using a standard and pretested questionnaire. Medical records were reviewed for each study participant using a standard checklist. Blood specimens were collected and examined for complete blood count, CD4 cell count and blood film for hemoparasites and morphological classification of anemia, whereas stool specimens were collected and examined for intestinal parasites. Data were entered into Epidata and transferred to SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) version 20 software. Descriptive analysis was done for prevalence and binary and multivariate logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with anemia. Statistical significance was stated at P-value<0.05. Results: The overall prevalence of anemia in this study was 11.4%. Morphologically the predominant anemia was Normocytic Normochromic anemia which accounted for 64.5%. In the current study, children within the age group of <7years (AOR: 3, CI: 1.2–7.5, P=0.02), those who were rural residents (AOR: 2.6, CI: 1.0–6.6, P=0.042) and those with viral load >150 copies/mL (AOR: 3.4, CI: 1.36–8.3, P=0.009) were found to be significantly associated with anemia. Conclusion: The prevalence of anemia in this study was 11.4%. It was significantly associated with different factors such as age, residence and viral load. Therefore, regular follow-up management should be emphasized for HAART-experienced children. Hence, there is a need for a longitudinal study to be conducted further to explore the causes of anemia due to HIV and the pattern of hemoglobin changes with HAART-experienced children will be very important.;https://www.dovepress.com/anemia-and-related-factors-among-highly-active-antiretroviral-therapy--peer-reviewed-article-DHPS;3.6;2.5;2.5;;;;;;

Therefore, the study aimed to assess the evaluation of antiretroviral therapy initiated among pregnant women under Option B+ by viral load and CD4 count outcomes in selected hospitals of West Shewa Zone, Oromia Region, Ethiopia. Methods: Hospital-based cross-sectional study design was employed to conduct the study at randomly selected hospitals providing Option B+ services with routine viral load assessment by Oromia Regional Laboratory (ORL) from January 2016 to January 2017. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine factors affecting the time to ART initiation following an HIV test and logistic regression was used to determine the correlation between time and treatment outcomes. Results: The viral load suppression (VL <1000 copies/mL) was achieved in 31% and 58.7% of patients who were on ART treatment for 37 months and longer than 38 months, respectively. It was identified that the mean viral load and CD4 count were 197.27 and 629.17, respectively, while 85.3% of the clients had their CD4 count increased from the baseline data. The study revealed that level of ART adherence, completion of full doses, compliance on appointments, duration of the ART uptake and baseline CD4 count were independent predictors of viral load suppression for women started on option B+ and continued on lifelong ART. And this study also revealed that gestational age at ARTstart, maternal age in years and adherence on medication were independently associated with CD4 response among HIV pregnant women initiated for lifelong ART. Conclusion: The study results demonstrated that for 89.7% of study respondents, viral load was suppressed of which 80.3% were undetectable (VL= 0 copies/ml3 and 85.3% had increased CD4 count). This study determined the factors associated with viral load suppression and CD4 count improvement. Therefore, these factors should be emphatically consid-ered during Option B+ program development and training to ensure CD4 count improvement and viral load suppression achievements.;https://www.dovepress.com/evaluation-of-antiretroviral-therapy-initiated-among-pregnant-women-un-peer-reviewed-article-HIV;4.3;5.0;2.4;;;;;;

With the aim of evaluating clinical practice in specialized respiratory units, a Delphi consensus document was implemented on the use of single-inhaler fixed-dose triple therapies after 1 year of use in Spain. Methods: A scientific committee of COPD experts defined a thematic index, guided a systematic literature review and helped design the Delphi questionnaire. This was sent to the other 45 COPD experts between April and June 2019. Agreement/disagreement on 58 statements was tested in two rounds using a Likert scale. Replies were classified as a consensus when 80% of the panelists agreed; a majority when a degree of agreement of 66% was reached; and divergence if agreement was <66%. Results: After two rounds, 44.44% of the statements reached consensus, 14.81% reached majority and 40.74% were divergent. Panelists agreed that escalating from double bronchodilation should be phenotype-based and aim to prevent exacerbations but not for improving symptoms. The addition of an antimuscarinic to inhaled corticosteroids combinations achieves improvement in lung function, symptoms and exacerbation prevention. Main safety concerns included the increased risk of pneumonia as compared to bronchodilator therapies, with similar cardiovascular effects. There was no consensus agreement on patient type response based on blood eosinophil counts or obstruction severity. Conclusion: The low degree of consensus among panelists may reflect the complexity of severe COPD management.

Mukose et al.Background. In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) revised the 2012 guidelines on use of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The new guidelines recommended lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding women irrespective of CD4 count or clinical stage (also referred to as Option B+). Uganda started implementing Option B+ in 2012 basing on the 2012 WHO guidelines. Despite the impressive benefits of the Option B+ strategy, implementation challenges, including cost burden and mother-baby pairs lost to follow-up, threatened its overall effectiveness. The researchers were unable to identify any studies conducted to assess costs and cost drivers associated with provision of Option B+ services to mother-baby pairs in HIV care in Uganda. Therefore, this study determined costs and cost drivers of providing Option B+ services to mother-baby pairs over a two-year period (2014-2015) in selected health facilities in Jinja district, Uganda. Methods. The estimated costs of providing Option B+ to mother-baby pairs derived from the provider perspective were evaluated at four health centres (HC) in Jinja district. A retrospective, ingredient-based costing approach was used to collect data for 2014 as base year using a standardized cost data capture tool. All costs were valued in United States dollars (USD) using the 2014 midyear exchange rate. Costs incurred in the second year (2015) were obtained by inflating the 2014 costs by the ratio of 2015 and 2014 USA Gross Domestic Product (GDP) implicit price deflator. Results. The average total cost of Option B+ services per HC was 66,512.7 (range: 32,168.2-102,831.1) USD over the 2-year period. The average unit cost of Option B+ services per mother-baby pair was USD 441.9 (range: 422.5-502.6). ART for mothers was the biggest driver of total mean costs (percent contribution: 62.6%; range: 56.0%-65.5%) followed by facility personnel (percent contribution: 8.2%; range: 7.7%-11.6%), and facility-level monitoring and quality improvement (percent contribution: 6.0%; range: 3.2%-12.3%). Conclusions and Recommendations. ART for mothers was the major cost driver. Efforts to lower the cost of ART for PMTCT would make delivery of Option B+ affordable and sustainable.";https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/2875864/;5.1;4.3;3.6;;32550228;2875864;;;

All rights reserved.Background: People living with HIV are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and carotid thickness, due to the inflammation caused by the virus, the antiretroviral therapy, and other risk factors. However, few studies have observed the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases and carotid thickness in HIV-positive population at low cardiovascular risk and with undetectable viral load. Objectives: To evaluate the association between levels of inflammatory markers and carotid thickness in people living with HIV, under antiretroviral therapy and at low cardiovascular risk. Methods: To determine low cardiovascular risk in both groups (HIV infected and non-infected individuals), the Framingham Risk Score was used. Inflammatory markers (IFN-, TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, sVCAM-1, and sICAM-1) were assessed using flow cytometry. Carotid thickness (mm) was measured using Doppler ultrasound. Level of significance was p < 0.05. Results: In People living with HIV, age and smoking status were associated with carotid thickness alterations. In the non-HIV group, age, higher total cholesterol, and LDL levels were associated with increased carotid thickness. Using the multivariate analysis, a significant association between TNF- and IL-1 levels, and a higher chance of atherosclerosis development in HIV group were observed. Conclusions: Both groups have a similar risk for developing cardiovascular disease, therefore our study demonstrates that HIV-positive individuals with undetectable viral load in antiretroviral therapy without protease inhibitors and with low cardiovascular risk do not present differences in carotid thickness in relation to uninfected individuals.

All Rights Reserved.Follicular helper T (TFH) cells have been shown to support productive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication and to serve as a key component of the latent viral reservoir. However, the viral characteristics of this latent reservoir and the clinical relevance of this reservoir remain unclear. In this study, we assessed the tropic composition of latent viruses from peripheral TFH (pTFH), non-TFH memory, and naive CD4 T cells from individuals with HIV-1 infections on suppressive combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). X4-tropic latent HIV-1 was preferentially enriched in pTFH cells compared to levels in the other two subsets. Interestingly, the ratio of X4-tropic latent HIV-1 in pTFH cells not only was robustly and inversely correlated with blood CD4 T cell counts across patients but also was prognostic of CD4 T cell recovery in individuals on long-term cART. Moreover, patients with higher X4-tropic latent HIV-1 ratios in pTFH cells showed greater risks of opportunistic coinfections. These findings reveal the characteristics of latent HIV-1 in TFH cells and suggest that the ratio of X4-tropic latent HIV-1 in pTFH cells is a valuable indicator for disease progression and cART efficacy. IMPORTANCE TFH cells have been shown to harbor a significant amount of latent HIV-1; however, the viral characteristics of this reservoir and its clinical relevance remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that X4-tropic latent HIV-1 is preferentially enriched in pTFH cells, which also accurately reflects the viral tropism shift. The ratio of X4-tropic proviruses in pTFH cells but not in other memory CD4 T cell subsets is inversely and closely correlated with blood CD4 T cell counts and CD4 T cell recovery rates with cART. Our data suggest that the ratio of X4-tropic provirus in peripheral TFH cells can be easily measured and reflects disease progression and treatment outcomes during cART.";https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/2/e01219-19;9.0;8.4;7.9;;31666372;e01219-19;;;

However, there has yet to be any study that has examined how early behavior problems may cluster together and how these clusters predict offending across the life-course. Latent class analysis was used to identify behavior classes comprising the onset of the childhood behavior problems: cheating, disrupting class, being drunk/stoned, stealing, and fighting. Analysis of variance was used to identify between-class differences in risk/protective factors. Age–crime curves were identified for groups to measure offending throughout the life-course. Results indicated that a three-class model best fits the data (Low EOBP, FDC, DCSF). Groups differed in risk/protective factor profiles. Age–crime curves indicated that participants assigned to the DCSF group demonstrated more serious offending in adolescence and that the FDC and DCSF groups demonstrated more serious offending in early adulthood. Identification of individuals reporting disturbing class, fighting, and stealing in childhood may be at elevated risk for more serious offending in adolescence.

Hepatotoxicity due to anti-tuberculosis drugs is a serious problem in the world especially for TB patients. Data reported that drug induce liver injury cases reached 33%. Meanwhile, snakehead fish extract reported have hepatoprotector activity. The aims of the research were to determine effect of snakehead fish extract on liver function in rats which receiving anti-tuberculosis in 21st days. Twenty rats were divided into 4 groups that are normal control groups (received CMC Na solution), negative control groups (received snakehead fish extract), treatment I (received anti-tuberculosis drugs in FDC regimen), treatment II (received anti-tuberculosis drugs and snakehead fish extract). SGPT, SGOT, ALP, and albumin were measured at baseline, 7th, 14th, and 21st days by spectrophotometer. The results showed that treatment I had hepatotoxic condition based on increases of SGPT and SGOT values compared to baseline and normal control groups. In general, there were increasing of SGPT and SGOT compared to baseline data for all groups. Rats groups received Anti-tuberculosis FDC has significant difference with normal control groups at 21st days. Meanwhile, ALP value of negative control and treatment II have increased from baseline to 21st days. In addition, albumin of negative control and treatment II have increased from baseline until 21st days. Whereas, normal control and treatment I were decreased. Increased level of albumin of previous groups due to albumin component in snakehead fish extract. Based on previous data, it could be concluded that orally administration of anti-tuberculosis for 21st days showed occurrence of hepatotoxic on rats and supplementation of snakehead fish extract could repaired the parameters become normal.;http://www.ijpronline.com/ViewSpecialArticleDetail.aspx?ID=299;0.2;0.3;0.8;;;;;;

Treatment is still largely targeted at lowering intraocular pressure. Intraocular pressures can be lowered through a variety of topical medications, lasers and incisional surgeries. There are currently several classes of topical medications available in the US that are aimed at lowering intraocular pressure through a variety of different mechanisms. Additionally, there have been numerous different formulations and fixed-dose combination medications that offer greatly expanded treatment options over the last several years. The wide variety of topical medications aim to address the issues with compliance, effectiveness and side effect profile that vary among each individual patient and disease. Purpose: Three new topical medications, netarsudil 0.02%, latanoprostene bunod 0.24% and fixed-dose combination netarsudil 0.02% - latanoprost 0.005% have been approved in the US market to treat glaucoma. This review article will summarize the studies looking at their effectiveness and side effect profiles and discuss their utilization in the treatment of glaucoma. Additionally, we will briefly discuss future directions of research in topical glaucoma medications. Conclusion: Three new topical glaucoma medications offer additional treatment options for patient with glaucoma. Further research is needed to better understand the utility of sustained release formulations in the treatment of glaucoma.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08820538.2020.1818796;2.0;2.0;2.5;;;;;;

We describe these evolutions of PHI patients diagnosed in France from 2014 to 2016. Methods: A total of 1121 PHI patients were included. TDRAMs were characterized using the 2009 Stanford list and the French ANRS algorithm. Viral subtypes and recent transmission clusters (RTCs) were also determined. Results: Patients were mainly MSM (70%) living in the Paris area (42%). TDRAMs were identified among 10.8% of patients and rose to 18.6% when including etravirine and rilpivirine TDRAMs. Prevalences of PI-, NRTI-, first-generation NNRTI-, second-generation NNRTI- A nd integrase inhibitor-associated TDRAMs were 2.9%, 5.0%, 4.0%, 9.4% and 5.4%, respectively. In a multivariable analysis, age >40 years and non-R5 tropic viruses were associated with a >2-fold increased risk of TDRAMs. Regarding HIV diversity, subtype B and CRF02_AG (where CRF stands for circulating recombinant form) were the two main lineages (56% and 20%, respectively). CRF02_AG was associated with higher viral load than subtype B (5.83 versus 5.40 log10 copies/mL, P=0.004). We identified 138 RTCs ranging from 2 to 14 patients and including overall 41% from the global population. Patients in RTCs were younger, more frequently born in France and more frequently MSM. Conclusions: Since 2007, the proportion of TDRAMs has been stable among French PHI patients. Non-B lineages are increasing and may be associated with more virulent CRF02_AG strains. The presence of large RTCs highlights the need for real-time cluster identification to trigger specific prevention action to achieve better control of the epidemic.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jac/dkz404/5602627;8.7;7.7;8.3;;31641777;;;;

Symptoms of mitochondrial toxicity including myopathy, pancreatitis, hyperlipidaemia and lactic acidosis are found among HIV-infected patients on ART. To date, there is not a reliable biomarker for monitoring ART-related mitochondrial toxicity. Plasma level of Cytochrome c (Cyt-c) has been proposed as a potential biomarker for ART-related toxicity due to its strong association with apoptosis. Objective: The present study assessed toxicity and level of plasma Cyt-c among HIV-infected patients receiving ART in Ghana. Methods: A total of eighty (80) HIV patients were recruited into the study. Demographic data were obtained from personal interview and medical records. Plasma samples were screened for toxicity from sixty (60) participants due to limited resources, and plasma Cyt-c levels were determined using ELISA. Data were analyzed using Stata version 13. Results: Out of the 60 participants, 11 (18.3%) were found with symptoms of myopathy, 12 (20%) with pancreatitis, 21 (35%) with hyperlipidaemia and 36 (60%) with at least one of the symptoms. The concentration of plasma Cyt-c was higher (0.122 ng/ml) in patients with toxicity than in those without toxicity (0.05 ng/ml), though the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.148). There was a weak correlation between plasma Cyt-c level and duration of ART (Spearman rho = 0.02, p = 0.89). Conclusion: This study, therefore, demonstrated a high prevalence of ART-related toxicity and high levels of Cyt-c in HIV-infected patients in support of the argument that plasma Cyt-c levels are potential biomarkers for determining ART-related toxicity in HIV patients.;http://www.eurekaselect.com/166956/article;2.1;1.9;1.4;;30387403;;;;

Ethiopia has the highest VL-HIV co-infection rate in the world, with several of these patients presenting with repeated episodes of VL disease (ie, relapse). However, we lack data on how HIV patients with multiple VL relapse present clinically, and whether they continue to respond to currently available medicines. Methods: The medical records of VL-HIV co-infected patients with multiple VL relapses at the Leishmaniasis Treatment and Research Center in Gondar, Ethiopia, between June 2012 and June 2016 were retrieved. Variables on their clinical and laboratory profiles were collected. Descriptive analysis was done to show the characteristics of the VL episodes. Result: A total of 48 VL episodes in 12 patients were identified, the median number of episodes per patient was 5 (interquartile range, 4–8 episodes). The median time to relapse was 5 months (interquartile range, 3–5.5 months). Splenomegaly was present in 47 of the episodes (98%), fever or other accompanying symptoms were present in only 66% (32 out of 48). The median tissue parasite grade at VL diagnosis was 6+ (interquartile range, 5+– 6+). All patients were on antiretroviral therapy. The median duration of treatment per episode was 2 months (interquartile range, 2–2 months). All patients achieved parasitological cure at discharge at each episode. Conclusions: Multiple recurrences of VL diseases were observed in HIV co-infected patients. With recurrent episodes, splenomegaly was found to be the main manifestation, whereas fever was less common. These patients came with recurrence of diseases in <6 months and required prolonged treatment to achieve cure. Further research on prediction, prevention, and better management options for recurrent VL is needed. ORCID ID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1410-0454.

Identification of the key receptor (sTNFR1 or sTNFR2) which drives the immunopathogenesis of HIV infection is crucial in developing adjunctive therapy for HIV. Objective: This study determined the expression levels of sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 in antiretroviral therapy (ART) – experienced and naïve HIV patients. Methods: A total of 40 HIV patients comprising 30 with ART and 10 without ART were enrolled from the Pantang Hospital located in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana for data and blood col-lection. Serum concentrations of sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 were determined by ELISA. Mann-Whitney U test was used to examine differences in serum levels of sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 between patients on ART and ART naïve patients. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was performed to determine the difference between sTNFR1 and sTNFR2, and Kruskal Wallis test was conducted to compare the effect of different antiretroviral drugs on the levels of sTNFR1 and sTNFR2. P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Test indicated serum levels of sTNFR2 was statistically significantly higher than sTNFR1 (Z=-5.51; p<0.001). Levels of sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 did not differ by ART status U =91.00 (Z =-1.84), p = 0.065 and U = 131.50 (Z =-0.58, p =0.560), respec-tively. There were not significant differences in levels of TNFR2 H(2) = 1.86, p=0.395 and sTNFR1 (H (2) = 4.37, p=0.113 across different ART combinations. Conclusion: Compared to sTNFR1, the level of sTNFR2 is significantly increased during HIV infection irrespective of ART status. The high sTNFR2 level is not associated with antiretroviral drugs and may be another potential target for therapuetic development. This is the first study of sTNFRs in African population.";https://www.eurekaselect.com/166287/article;2.1;1.9;1.4;;30324895;;;;

The plausibility of utilizing hot fusion to prepare solid lipid dispersions containing the prescribed first-line, double-fixed dose combination (artemether and lumefantrine), proposed for inclusion in directly compressed lipid matrix tablets, was investigated. Significance: Currently, no anti-malarial product is commercially available that employs lipid technology in a solid oral dosage form that contains this double-fixed dose combination. Through developing lipid matrix tablets, the stability, solubility and subsequent bioavailability of these drugs could be significantly enhanced in the presence of lipids or oils. Methods: Hot fusion encompasses encompassed melt mixing of a selected lipid base and the dispersion of the active ingredient(s) therein below their glass transition temperatures. Solid-state characterization, particle size analysis and pharmacotechnical properties were evaluated, with particular focus given to powder flowability. Results: Stearic acid in a 0.5:1 lipid:drug ratio demonstrated the best powder flow properties of the investigated solid lipid dispersion for inclusion into prospective lipid–matrix tablets duly based on an increase in overall particle size, a more spherical particle shape and improved powder flow properties compared to the individual active ingredients. Conclusion: Good powder flow is critical for powders destined for inclusion into tablets–especially when employing direct compression as method of manufacture–in this case, lipid matrix tablets, which have demonstrated huge promise as a prospective dosage form for future use in malarial treatment.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03639045.2020.1788065;3.8;4.0;4.2;;32594776;;;;

Methods: Retrospective chart review Results: A 73-year-old Greek woman with a history of follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS) presented with bilateral corneal perforations and a cicatrizing conjunctivitis. Her diagnosis was consistent with PNP with corneal and conjunctival involvement after a change in her chemotherapy regimen from intravenous cyclophosphamide to gemcitabine. She was treated with a multilayered amniotic membrane in the right eye and cyanoacrylate glue in the left eye. Systemic intravenous cyclophosphamide and oral prednisone were re-started. Both perforations healed but the patient passed away soon after precluding further follow-up. Conclusions: Ocular manifestations of PNP can rarely present with spontaneous corneal perforations. This is the first case of FDCS-associated PNP with corneal involvement. Such cases should be diagnosed expediently and managed with aggressive systemic immunosuppressive therapy.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09273948.2020.1828491;3.0;2.9;3.1;;;;;;

Here we use metabolic labeling with stable isotopes and mass spectrometry to quantitatively address the global turnover of genomic 5-methyl-2-deoxycytidine (mdC), 5-hydroxymethyl-2-deoxycytidine (hmdC) and 5-formyl-2-deoxycytidine (fdC) across mouse pluripotent cell states. High rates of mdC/hmdC oxidation and fdC turnover characterize a formative-like pluripotent state. In primed pluripotent cells, the global mdC turnover rate is about 3–6% faster than can be explained by passive dilution through DNA synthesis. While this active component is largely dependent on ten-eleven translocation (Tet)-mediated mdC oxidation, we unveil additional oxidation-independent mdC turnover, possibly through DNA repair. This process accelerates upon acquisition of primed pluripotency and returns to low levels in lineage-committed cells. Thus, in pluripotent cells, active mdC turnover involves both mdC oxidation-dependent and oxidation-independent processes.

Despite the reduction in morbidity and mortality, a considerable proportion of patients fail to achieve a sustained virologic response to therapy. Thus virological failure is an increasing concern globally. Objective: This study aimed to assess the virological failure and associated risk factors among HIV/AIDS pediatric patients at Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) follow up clinic of Jimma University Medical Center, southwest Ethiopia. Methods: An institution based cross-sectional study was conducted at the ART follow-up clinic of Jimma University Medical Center. A structured English version checklist was developed and used for data extraction from patients’ charts from April-May 2019. Then the data was coded and entered using epi data 4.2 and exported to statistical package for social science (SPSS version 22) for analysis. Descriptive analysis was conducted for categorical as well as continuous variables. Multivariable logistic regression was performed in a backward, step-wise manner until a best-fit model was found. Results: Of 140 HIV/AIDS pediatric patients enrolled in this study, 72(51.4%) were male and the mean age was 9.7±3.3 Years. ABC-3TC-NVP was the commonly used ART medication in this population, which was 37.1% followed by AZT-3TC-EFV(32.1%). The mean duration of antiretroviral treatment (ART) follow-up was 63.8±29.4 months. Among the study population, 11.0% of them had virological failure. Weight at ART initiation [OR=1.104, 95 CI% [1.013-1.203], p=0.024] and WHO clinical stage 3 [AOR=0.325, 95CI, 0.107-0.991,P=0.048] were the significant risk factors for the virological failure. Conclusion: A significant proportion of HIV/AIDS pediatric patients had virological failure. Weight at ART initiation and patients having WHO clinical stage 3 were risk factors associated with virological failure in this study. Governmental and non-governmental concerned bodies should invest their effort to devise strategies for the achievement of HIV/AIDS treatment targets.;https://openaidsjournal.com/VOLUME/14/PAGE/61/;2.1;3.5;4.9;;;;;;

Several factors affect the CD4+ T-cell count. This study aimed to assess the immunological response during HAART and determinants of the current CD4+ T-cell count among HIV/AIDS patients on HAART. Patients and Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 1 to April 1, 2017. A total of 423 HIV/AIDS patients on HAART were enrolled using simple random sampling. Descriptive statistics, and bivariate and multiple regression analyses were conducted. Variables with p-value <0.2 in the bivariate analysis were entered in the multiple regression models. p-Values <0.05 and 95% confidence intervals were used to identify determinants of the current CD4+ T-cell count. Results: The mean CD4+ T-cell count gradually increased until 8 years on HAART but declined thereafter. An increased current CD4+ T-cell count was observed among patients with an initial regimen of pediatric d4T-3TC-NVP [=185.5, 95% CI (8.8, 362.2)] (p=0.040), with increased baseline CD4+ T-cell count [=0.468, 95% CI (0.342, 0.594)] (p<0.0001), and with long duration on HAART [=18.0, 95% CI (9.9, 26.1)] (p<0.0001), whereas a decreased level of current CD4+ T-cell count was observed among males [=72.7, 95% CI (114.5, –30.9)]) (p<0.0001) and those with poor baseline adherence [=108.9, 95% CI (210.9, 7.0)] (p=0.036) and viral load >1000 copies [=189.2, 95% CI (243.5, 134.9)] (p<0.0001). Conclusion: The trend in immunological response was not increased linearly throughout the HAART duration. Sex, type of initial regimen, baseline adherence, baseline CD4+ count, viral load, and duration on HAART were independent determinants of current CD4+ count. These determinants could be addressed by regular monitoring of HIV patients on HAART, and special attention should be paid to male patients.;https://www.dovepress.com/immunological-response-during-haart-and-determinants-of-current-cd4-t--peer-reviewed-article-HIV;4.3;5.0;2.4;;;;;;

The method was developed by the implementation of analytical quality by design approach based on principles of quality risk management (QRM) and design of experiments (DoE) as per regulatory requirements. Methods: QRM was applied for the analysis of twenty potential method risk parameters using the Ishikawa diagram and quality risk assessment according to ICH Q9 guideline. DoE was applied by Taguchi OA screening design and Box-Behnken response surface analysis method. Method operable design range was navigated for optimisation of critical method risk parameters as per the analytical target profile for development of the method. The developed method was applied for the analysis of three different fixed-dose combination products of metformin hydrochloride. Results: By the QRM process, seven method risk parameters were found critical for the development of the method. After the Taguchi screening design, the main effect of mobile phase composition, %w/v of ammonium acetate and saturation time was found to be significant. The results of the Box-Behnken design showed a quadratic relationship between CMPs and CMAs. The developed method was found to be specific, accurate and precise. The results of the assay were found in good agreement with the labelled claim. Conclusion: The developed method can analyse three different fixed-dose combination products of metformin hydrochloride which required three different chromatography methods. Hence, the method is versatile and eco-friendly.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12247-020-09506-5;3.7;3.4;2.5;;;;;;

All rights reserved.Introduction: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an independent risk factor of arterial hypertension. There is a limited data on blood pressure among HIV-positive patients living in rural areas in Africa according to the clinical progress of the disease. The aim of the study was to compare blood pressure (BP) parameters among HIV-positive adults with advanced and non-advanced HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) living in rural Kenya. Material and methods: In this prospective, two-center, cross-sectional study, we examined HIV- positive individuals visiting the outpatient department for a routine check-up. BP was measured by OMRON M2 Basic BP monitor (Omron, Japan) and clinical data was collected from patients' data charts. World Health Organization AIDS clinical stage (WACS) equal to 1 was defined as non-advanced HIV, while WACS equals 2, 3, or 4 were classified as advanced HIV. Data presented as median (interquartile range). Results: From the total of 245 (female, 192; 78%) participants, 162 individuals presented non-advanced HIV disease, whereas 83 had advanced HIV. Both groups did not differ significantly regarding sex, age, time since HIV diagnosis, body mass index, waist circumference, use of antiretroviral treatment, nor presence of abnormal blood pressure. However, there were significant differences between patients with non-advanced HIV and advanced HIV in diastolic BP (DBP) [71 (64-77) vs. 81 (75-88); p < 0.0001], mean BP (MBP) [87 (80-94) vs. 95 (88-102); p < 0.0001], and pulse pressure (PP) [48 (42-56) vs. 43 (35-50); p < 0.0001]. A tendency, but not significant difference between study groups in systolic BP [119 (109-129) vs. 122 (114-133); p = 0.07] was observed. Conclusions: HIV-positive patients with advanced form of HIV disease have higher DBP, MBP, and lower PP than individuals with non-advanced HIV living in rural Kenya.";https://www.termedia.pl/doi/10.5114/hivar.2020.96242;0.6;0.4;0.5;;;;;;

Objective: To identify the diversity difference in protease and reverse transcriptase between CRF55_01B and its parental clades CRF01_AE and subtype B; and to investigate CRF55_01B’s drug resistance mutations associated with the protease inhibition and reverse transcriptase inhibition. Methods: HIV-1 RNA was extracted from plasma derived from a MSM population. The reverse transcription and nested PCR amplification were performed following our in-house PCR procedure. Genotyping and drug resistant-associated mutations and polymorphisms were identified based on polygenetic analyses and the usage of the HIV Drug Resistance Database, respectively. Results: A total of 9.24 % of the identified CRF55_01B sequences bear the primary drug resistance. CRF55_01B contains polymorphisms I13I/V, G16E and E35D that differ from those in CRF01_AE. Among the 11 polymorphisms in the RT region, seven were statistically different from CRF01_AE’s. Another three polymorphisms, R211K (98.3%), F214L (98.3%), and V245A/E (98.3 %.), were identified in the RT region and they all were statistically different with that of the subtype B. The V179E/D mutation, responsible for 100% potential low-level drug resistance, was found in all CRF55_01B sequences. Lastly, the phylogenetic analyses demonstrated 18 distinct clusters that account for 35% of the samples. Conclusion: CRF55_01B’s pol has different genetic diversity comparing to its counterpart in CRF55_01B’s parental clades. CRF55_01B has a high primary drug resistance presence and the V179E/D mutation may confer more vulnerability to drug resistance.";http://www.eurekaselect.com/180913/article;2.7;2.4;2.3;;32294040;;;;

All rights reserved.Introduction: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) restores immune function and reduces human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related adverse outcomes. However, treatment failure erodes this advantage and leads to an increased morbidity and compromised quality of life in HIV patients. The purpose of this study was to assess prevalence of first-line antiretroviral treatment failure and factor associated with treatment failure following antiretroviral therapy at the Shashemene Referral Hospital. Material and methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study with first-line HAART failure card review and it was carried out at HAART clinic of the Shashemene Referral Hospital. The study included 69 HIV-positive patients who had started HAART between 2013 and January 6, 2016. Results: The study showed that out of 69 study participants, 10 (14.5%) patients developed treatment failure, and among them, an immunologic failure occurred in 6 patients (60%), virologic failure was detected in 2 cases (20%), and clinical failure occurred in 1 patient (10%). Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, advanced World Health Organization (WHO) stage four (AOR = 47.6; 95% CI: 2.3-552.4) and good adherence (AOR = 0.094; 95% CI: 0.014-0.610) had significant negative association with treatment failure. Conclusions: The overall first-line treatment failure rate was 14.5% (10 patients). Prevention and control of the development of advanced World Health Organization (WHO) stage, improving adherence, promotion of HAART initiation at active functional status and higher CD4 count, prevention of multiple or many opportunistic infections were the primary conclusions of our study.";https://www.termedia.pl/doi/10.5114/hivar.2020.96388;0.6;0.4;0.5;;;;;;

This study investigated antihypertensive utilization patterns among hypertensive patients who were prescribed treatment, yet still experienced uncontrolled hypertension. Data from the Decision Resources Group Real World Evidence Data Repository US database (2015-2016) were used to construct a cohort of uncontrolled hypertension patients to observe antihypertensive utilization patterns. Results for 5059 patients, with an average age of 57.8 (SD = 13.7), who had, on average 2.4 agents prescribed. Approximately half (51.9%) were female, and most were White (86.8%). More than one-third (N = 1877; 37.1%) of patients were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) that could independently contribute to increased cardiovascular complications. Overall, the most common treatments prescribed, as percent of agents and as percent of patients, respectively, were diuretics (24.9%; 59.6%), followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (23.8%; 56.9%), beta-blockers (BBs) (18.7%; 44.8%), calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (15.4%; 36.8%), and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (13.5%; 32.3%). Approximately one-tenth (10.5%) of the prescriptions were written for fixed-dose combination therapies. Among patients diagnosed with DM and CKD (N = 200), the order of the most common agents was the same as the overall cohort. Only 5.6% of prescriptions written for these patients were fixed-dose combination therapy. Based on clinical guidelines, which suggest using ACEIs, ARBs, or CCBs as first-line therapy, and fixed-dose combination therapy to increase adherence, this indicates over-prescribing of BBs and under-prescribing of fixed-dose combination therapy. These findings illustrate the need to further investigate challenges faced by patients and providers in treatment decision-making.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jch.14041;4.3;3.8;4.0;;;;;;

We evaluated the risk of PDR on treatment failure if detected at single or multiple codons, at minority (2–9%) or higher (10%) frequencies during efavirenz- vs. nevirapine-ART. Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis across three cohorts of Kenyans initiating 1st-line NNRTI-ART between 2006 and 2014. Mutations K103N, Y181C, G190A, M184V and K65R were detected by an oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA) and confirmed by Sanger and next-generation sequencing (NGS). PDR was defined as detection of any mutation by OLA when confirmed by NGS. Treatment failure, defined as plasma HIV RNA 400 copies/mL at month-12 of ART, was compared by PDR genotypes. Findings: PDR was detected in 59/1231 (4·8%) participants. Compared to wild-type genotypes, PDR in participants prescribed nevirapine-ART was associated with increased treatment failure [PDR 69·2% (27/39) vs. wild-type 10·4% (70/674); p = 0·0001], whether detected as minority [66·7% (4/6)] or higher [69·7% (23/33)] frequencies in an individual's HIV quasispecies (p = 0·002 and p < 0·0001, respectively), or mutations at single [50·0% (12/24)] or multiple [100·0% (15/15)] codons (p < 0·0001). During efavirenz-ART, PDR was also associated with increased virologic failure [PDR 25·0% (5/20) vs. wild-type 5·0% (25/498); p = 0·005], but only if detected at multiple drug-resistant codons [50·0% (3/6); p = 0·003] or high frequencies PDR [33·3% (5/15); p = 0·001]. Interpretation: The risk that PDR confers for treatment failure varies by number of mutant codons and their frequency in the quasispecies, with a lower risk for efavirenz- compared to nevirapine-based regimens. PDR detection and management could extend the effective use of efavirenz-ART in low-resource settings.

This study was aimed at determining the incidence and the onset of hepatotoxicity and at evaluating the relationship of some risk factors for hepatotoxicity among Human Immunodeficiency Virus- (HIV-) positive, tuberculosis (TB), and HIV/TB patients on treatment. This was a prospective follow-up study involving 125 participants from the HIV/AIDS and TB treatment centres in three hospitals in Fako Division of Cameroon. These TB and HIV patients were initiated on RHEZ (R = Rifampicin, H = Isoniazid, E = Ethambutol, and P = Pyrazinamide) and TELE (efavirenz/tenofovir/lamivudine), respectively, and followed up for 12 weeks between September 2018 and November 2019. The levels of liver enzymes (transaminases, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and unconjugated/total bilirubin) were measured spectrophotometrically using serum. The Chi-squared (2) test was used to assess the association between risk factors and hepatotoxicity, while the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with the log-rank test was used to determine the occurrence of hepatotoxicity in the different groups. We followed the general study population for a total person time of 6580 person-days, with an incidence rate and cumulative incidence of 8 cases per 1000 person-days (53/6580 person-days) and 42.4% (53/125), respectively (95% confidence interval), recorded after 12 weeks of follow-up of all the participants. The onset of hepatotoxicity in the total study population was statistically significant (2=9.5334; p=0.022979; CI=95%), with the majority observed at week eight of follow-up. Also, the incidence rate and cumulative incidence of hepatotoxicity with respect to HIV/AIDS, TB, and HIV/TB patients, respectively, at 95% confidence interval were: 8 cases per 1000 person-days (32/3843 person-days) and 32/76 (42.1%), 6 cases per 1000 person-days (12/1932 person-days) and 12/32 (37.5%), and 11 cases per 1000 person-days (9/805 person-days) and 9/17 (52.9%).

Few new generation sequencing data are available. Objective: To check that the automated deep sequencing Sentosa platform (Vela DX) detected minority resistant variants well enough for HIV DNA genotyping. Study design: We evaluated the Sentosa SQ HIV genotyping assay with automated extraction on 40 DNA longitudinal samples from treatment-experienced patients by comparison with Sanger sequencing. HIV drug resistance was interpreted using the ANRS algorithm (v29) at the threshold of 20 % and 3 %. Results: The Sentosa SQ HIV genotyping assay was 100 % successful to amplify and sequence PR and RT and 86 % to amplify and sequence IN when the HIV DNA load was >2.5 log copies/million cells. The Sentosa and Sanger sequencing were concordant for predicting PR-RT resistance at the threshold of 20 % in 14/18 samples successfully sequenced. A higher level of resistance was predicted by Sentosa in three samples and by Sanger in one sample. The prevalence of resistance was 7 % to PI, 59 % to NRTI, 31 % to NNRTI and 20 % to integrase inhibitors using the Sentosa SQ genotyping assay at the threshold of 3 %. Seven additional mutations <20 % were detected using the Sentosa assay. Conclusion: Automated DNA extraction and sequencing using the Sentosa SQ HIV genotyping assay accurately predicted HIV DNA drug resistance by comparison with Sanger.

In contrast, diagnoses of DMAC more than doubled from 1990 to 1996. During this time, DMAC prevalence in people living with AIDS (PLHA) in developed countries reached 20-23% overall and >40% in groups with CD4 cell counts <10 cells/mm3. At present, DMAC in PLHA has an incidence of two events per 1000 patient years. Recently, the centers for disease control changed the criteria for MAC primary prophylaxis, where only patients without immediate cART and CD4 cell counts <50 cells/mm3 are prescribed 1200 mg of azithromycin weekly. Treatment is discontinued when patients initiate effective cART. Diagnosing a disseminated M. avium infection is difficult due to the low accuracy of fluid cultures and a lack of diagnostic processes. However, the usefulness of newer molecular techniques such as whole-genome sequencing has not been evaluated for DMAC and HIV/AIDS. As DMAC has a high mortality rate if not properly diagnosed and treated, we performed a literature review of HIV/AIDS and DMAC epidemiology, risk factors, prophylaxis, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.;http://www.aidsreviews.com/resumen.php?id=1516;4.0;3.4;3.1;;32167509;;;;

Home prepared meso-tetra aryl substituted porphyrins (Pps) whether metal-free (H2Pp) or containing Cu(II) or Zn(II) complexes (CuPp, ZnPp), opportunely functionalized with lipophilic [(3-n-pentadecylphenoxyethoxy)-] chains, were supported on graphitic (g-C3N4) or thermo-exfoliated carbon nitride (C3N4-TE) to obtain a set of heterogeneous photocatalysts. The loading of the Pps on both carbon nitrides was 6 mol per gram of support. During the experiments all the photocatalysts resulted active for the conversion of HMF, and in all cases its partial oxidation product, 2,5-furandicarboxyaldehyde (FDC), was selectively obtained in the aqueous suspension. Both carbon nitrides played the key role as photocatalysts whereas the presence of porphyrin improved the visible light absorption. The presence of the metal-porphyrin in the composite slightly increased the selectivity to FDC. The best compromise between selectivity to FDC (36%) and conversion of HMF (73%) was obtained in the presence of the ZnPp-C3N4-TE photocatalyst at natural pH. Moreover, at pH 9 the CuPp-C3N4-TE sample showed the best performances, indicating that the pH can affect the photocatalytic activity of the samples towards the partial selective oxidation of HMF to FDC.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11244-020-01293-0;4.2;3.4;4.4;;;;;;

Artificial intelligence methods e.g. Support Vector Machines for Regression (SVR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are useful techniques in the prediction of FDCs in ungagged basins. Regional analysis of FDCs were performed through SVR, ANN and Nonlinear Regression (NLR) using streamflow with durations of 0.02, 0.10, 0.20, 0.50 and 0.90% as dependent variables and six watershed characteristics chosen as effective independent variables on 33 selected watersheds in the Namak-Lake basin located in central zone of Iran. The results shows that the most important watershed characteristics are weighted average height, area, rangeland area, drainage density, permeable formation, and average stream slope. SVR has higher accuracy with relative root mean squared error (RMSEr) of 9.37 to 1.45 and Nash-Sutcliff criterion (NSE) of 0.54 to 0.91 than ANN with RMSEr with 9.42 to 3.79 and NSE of 0.39 to 0.86 and NLR with RMSEr with 18.04 to 3.38 and NSE of 0.53 to 0.79. In general, SVR is proposed to be used to estimate FDCs.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11269-019-02445-y;5.0;5.2;5.4;;;;;;

The use of mobile technology may address the need for standardized tools in measuring adherence in this often marginalized population. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional validation study among AYAs (18–35 years) attending a South African HIV clinic between 07/2015-09/2017. We determine the diagnostic accuracy of two modes of delivering an adherence questionnaire (self-administered electronic vs interviewer-administered paper-adherence questionnaire) comprising two self-reported adherence tools (South African National Department of Health (NDoH) adherence questionnaire and the Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ)) to identify poor adherence compared to; 1) a detectable viral load (1000 copies/mL) and 2) a sub-optimal concentration of efavirenz (EFV) (EFV 1.00 µg/mL) measured by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Results: Of 278 included participants, 7.1% and 7.3% completing the electronic-and paper-questionnaires had a detectable viral load, while 14.7% and 16.5% had a sub-optimal concentration of EFV, respectively. According to viral load monitoring, the electronic-adherence questionnaire had a higher sensitivity (Se) in detecting poor adherence than the paper-based version across the NDoH adherence questionnaire (Se: 63.6% vs 33.3%) and SMAQ (Se: 90.9% vs 66.7%). In contrast, when using blood drug concentration (EFV 1.00 µg/mL), the paper-adherence questionnaire produced a higher sensitivity across both adherence tools; namely the NDoH adherence questionnaire (Se: 50.0% vs 38.1%) and SMAQ (Se: 75.0% vs 57.1%). Conclusion: When using more accurate real-time measures of poor adherence such as TDM in this young adult population, we observe a higher sensitivity of an interviewer-administered paper-adherence questionnaire than an identical set of self-administered adherence questions on an electronic tablet. An interviewer-administered questionnaire may elicit more accurate responses from participants through a sense of increased accountability when engaging with health care workers.";https://www.dovepress.com/using-a-self-administered-electronic-adherence-questionnaire-to-identi-peer-reviewed-article-PPA;3.1;3.0;3.5;;;;;;

This study aimed to characterize LFTs in a large cohort of participants with acute HIV infection initiating immediate antiretroviral therapy (ART) and examine the association between LFTs and biomarkers of HIV infection and inflammation. Methods: We measured LFTs at the time of HIV diagnosis and at 4, 12, 24 and 48 weeks after ART initiation in 426 Thai individuals with acute HIV infection from 2009 to 2018. A subset of individuals had data available at 96 and 144 weeks. We excluded individuals with concomitant viral hepatitis. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was the primary outcome of interest; values greater than 1.25 times the upper limit of normal were considered elevated. Analyses utilized descriptive statistics, non-parametric tests and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Sixty-six of the 426 individuals (15.5%) had abnormal baseline ALT levels; the majority (43/66, 65.5%) had Grade 1 elevations. Elevated baseline ALT correlated with Fiebig stages III to V (p = 0.001) and baseline HIV RNA >6 log10 copies/mL (p = 0.012). Baseline elevations resolved by 48 weeks on ART in 59 of the 66 individuals (89%). ALT elevations at 24 and 48 weeks correlated with Fiebig stages I to II at diagnosis (p < 0.001), baseline plasma HIV RNA levels <6 log10 copies/mL (p < 0.001), abnormal baseline ALT (p < 0.001), baseline CD4 >350 cells/L (p = 0.03) and older age (p = 0.03). Individuals initiating efavirenz-based regimens were more likely to have elevated ALT levels at 48 weeks compared with those on non-efavirenz-based regimens (p = 0.003). Conclusions: One in six people with acute HIV infection have elevated LFTs. Clinical outcomes with ART started in acute HIV are generally good, with resolution of ALT elevations within 48 weeks on ART in most cases. These results suggest a multifactorial model for hepatic injury involving a combination of HIV-associated and ART-associated processes, which may change over time.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jia2.25444;5.5;6.7;7.1;;31953919;e25444;;;

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is expanding and improving HIV viral suppression, resulting in increasing exposure to drugs and drug interactions. Polypharmacy is a common complication as people are living longer on ART, increasing the risk of drug toxicities. Polypharmacy is related not only to ART exposure and medication for opportunistic infections, but also to treatment of chronic lifestyle diseases. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is frequent in HIV and is commonly the result of sepsis, dehydration and drug toxicities. Furthermore, HIV itself increases the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Drug treatment is often complicated in people living with HIV because of a greater incidence of AKI and/or CKD compared to the HIV-negative population. Impaired renal function affects drug interactions, drug toxicities and importantly drug dosing, requiring dose adjustment. This review discusses ART and its nephrotoxic effects, including drug-drug interactions. It aims to guide the clinician on dose adjustment in the setting of renal impairment and dialysis, for the commonly used drugs in patients with HIV.;https://www.drugsincontext.com/HIV,-drugs-and-the-kidney/;5.3;3.5;2.6;;;2019111;;;

The approaches are referred to as Full Duplication with Comparison (FDC) and Concurrent Checking with Parity Prediction (CCPP). Aforementioned approaches are focused on the borderline cases of FEDC method which implement Error Detection Circuit (EDC) in two manners for the purpose of protection of combinational logic to address the soft errors of unspecified duration. The FDC approach implements a full duplication of the combinational circuit, as the most complex and expensive implementation of the FEDC method, and the CCPP approach implements only the parity prediction bit, being the simplest and cheapest technique, for soft error detection. Both approaches are capable of detecting soft errors in the combinational logic, with single faults being injected into the design. On the one hand, the FDC approach managed to detect and correct all injected faults while the CCPP approach could not detect multiple faults created at the output of combinational circuit. On the other hand, the FDC approach leads to higher power consumption and area increase compared to the CCPP approach.;https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218126620502187;1.0;1.5;2.1;;;2050218;;;

Mortality is a competing risk of loss to follow up but it is often overlooked and there is limited evidence about the incidence and predictors of loss to follow up in the presence of competing events. Objective To assess the Incidence and predictors of loss to follow up among adult HIV patients on ART in University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2018. Methods Institution based retrospective follow up study was conducted in University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. A Gray's test and cumulative incidence curve were used to compare the cumulative incidence function of loss to follow up. Bivariable and multivariable competing risk regression models were fitted to identify the predictors of lost to follow up and those variables with p-value <0.05 in the multivariable analysis was considered as significant predictors of lost to follow up. Result A total of 531 adult HIV patients on ART were included in the analysis. The incidence rate of loss to follow up in this study was 10.90 (95% CI: 8.9-13.2) per 100 person years. Being age group 15-30 years (aSHR = 2.01; 95%CI;1.11-3.63), being daily laborer(aSHR = 2.60; 95% CI;1.45-4.66), not receiving cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (aSHR = 2.66; 95%CI;1.68-4.21), not receiving isoniazid preventive therapy(aSHR = 4.57; 95% CI;1.60-13.08), ambulatory functional status (aSHR = 1.61; 95% CI; 1.02-2.51) and taking AZT-3TC-NVP medication at start of ART(aSHR = 2.01; 95% CI; 1.16-3.78) were significant predictors of lost to follow up. Conclusion In this study the incidence of lost to follow up was high. Young people, daily laborer, ambulatory patients and those taking AZT-3TC-NVP as well as those who did not take opportunistic prophylaxis were at higher risk of loss to follow up. Therefore, giving special attention to the high-risk groups for lost to follow up highlighted in this study could decrease the rate of LTFU.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0227473;5.7;5.4;5.2;;31978137;e0227473;;;

Interventions for improving adherence need to consider the characteristics of the individual therapeutic regimens according to the needs of the patients. In particular, geriatric and paediatric populations as well as dermatological patients have special needs/preferences that should be considered when designing drug products. Patient Centric Drug Product Pharmaceutical Design (PCDPD) offers the opportunity to meet the needs and preferences of patients.

Objective: To investigate which factors of the first diagnostic consultation (FDC) influence patient satisfaction and which topics persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) thought were missing. Methods: Using retrospective patient-reported data of the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Registry from PwMS with relapsing disease onset, we fitted ordered logistic regression models on satisfaction with FDC, with socio-demographic and FDC features as explanatory factors. Results: 386 PwMS diagnosed after 1995 were included. Good satisfaction with the FDC was associated with a conversation more than 20 min [multivariable odds ratio, 95% confidence interval 3.9 (2.42; 6.27)], covering many topics [1.35 (1.19; 1.54) per additional topic], the presence of a significant others [1.74 (1.03; 2.94)], and shared decision making [3.39 (1.74; 6.59)]. Not receiving a specific diagnosis was main driver for low satisfaction [0.29 (0.15; 0.55)]. Main missing topics concerned long-term consequences (reported by 6.7%), psychological aspects (6.2%) and how to obtain support and further information (5.2%). Conclusions: A conversation of more than 20 min covering many MS relevant topics, a clear communication of the diagnosis, the presence of a close relative or significant other, as well as shared decision making enhanced patient satisfaction with the FDC.

Ezetimibe–aspirin (EZT–ASA) solid dispersions prepared by grinding in the whole range of compositions were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for purpose to describe solid-liquid phase equilibrium diagram. The occurrence of interactions between ingredients was excluded by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffractometry. Dissolution studies have shown that the mixtures containing from 10 to 60 mass% of EZT (53.5 mass% of EZT in eutectic composition) have released ezetimibe faster than a sample of pure drug. Moreover, ASA is released more quickly from all obtained dispersions than from powder alone. Our studies have shown that obtained mixtures are useful to obtain the fixed-dose combinations, capable to deliver these two APIs together in a single system with enhanced dissolution of EZT and ASA.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10973-020-09543-9;3.6;3.9;4.3;;;;;;

There are only a few hundred reported FDCS cases, and the role for adjuvant chemo-or radiation therapy has not been established. Choosing an appropriate therapy in disseminated disease can therefore be challenging. A 26-year-old patient with FDCS was admitted with dyspnea, fever, and night sweats. He was found to have a large right hemothorax with compressive atelectasis on initial imaging. CT of the chest revealed multiple bilateral lung and pleural nodules with associated bilateral hilar adenopathy, a hypodense mass within the right hemithorax, and necrotic right external iliac and inguinal nodes. Inguinal node biopsy diagnosed FDCS. The patient was initially treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone chemotherapy. Gemcitabine/Taxotere was given as second-line therapy and pembrolizumab as third-line therapy, with continued disease progression after 2 cycles of both regimens. The patient was switched to fourth-line therapy with pazopanib and had a partial response for 9 months. This case illustrates a successful FDCS treatment with pazopanib. Due to the rarity of FDCS, where large studies comparing treatment approaches are not available, recommendations for optimal treatment are not well defined. This case is in support of growing evidence suggesting that FDCS responds to systemic therapies that are used for soft tissue sarcoma, such as pazopanib.;https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/509771;1.2;1.0;1.3;;;;;;

Research to date has not explored associations between adolescent HIV self-management and treatment adherence, viral suppression, sexual risk behaviour and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Objectives: To explore the associations between adolescent HIV self-management and treatment adherence, viral suppression, sexual risk behaviour and HRQoL. Methods: A quantitative cross-sectional study of 385 adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) aged 13-18 years, who were recruited from 11 healthcare facilities between March and August 2017 in the Cape Metropole of the Western Cape, South Africa, provided the data that were examined in this self-completed questionnaire. Validated scales were used to measure key variables. The most recent viral load (VL) was obtained from the participants' clinic folder, taking into account that VL is done annually. Results: Adolescents who reported higher HIV self-management were more likely to be adherent to treatment (t = 4.435 [336], p < 0.01), virally suppressed (t = 2.376 [305], p = 0.02) and to practise consistent condom use (t = 1.947 [95], p = 0.54). Structural equation modelling (SEM) indicated a significant relationship between self-management and HRQoL (r = 0.43, p < 0.01), whilst non-adherent treatment taking behaviour, correlated with elevated VL log values. No significant correlation was found between self-management and sexual risk behaviour. Conclusion: Targeting adolescents' skills related to HIV self-management in the clinical setting may improve adolescents' treatment taking behaviour, viral suppression rates and their HRQoL.;http://www.sajhivmed.org.za/index.php/HIVMED/article/view/1054;1.6;1.2;1.3;;;a1054;;;

Methods: Two systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify direct comparisons (head-to-head randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) and indirect comparisons (network meta-analyses [NMAs]; indirect treatment comparisons; meta-analyses) in patients with COPD with moderate-to-very severe airflow limitation. Study/Analysis characteristics, eligibility criteria, patient characteristics, and overall conclusions were extracted from relevant publications. The review of indirect comparisons focused on NMAs reporting efficacy outcomes at 12 and 24 weeks of treatment (established durations of symptomatic studies in COPD recommended by regulators). Results: Direct comparisons: Four RCTs that provided head-to-head comparisons of LAMA/ LABA FDCs were identified, and these varied in their study design, included patient population and reported endpoints. While some differences in lung function outcomes were noted, where assessed, LAMA/LABA FDCs had comparable efficacy in improving symptoms, health status, exacerba-tions, and comparable safety profiles. However, the differences in study methodology and patient characteristics between these studies made it difficult to draw generalizable conclusions regarding the comparative effectiveness of LAMA/LABA FDCs from the direct comparisons alone. Indirect comparisons: Six NMAs were identified that reported indirect comparisons between LAMA/ LABA FDCs; five of these were within the pre-defined scope of this review. Although the scope of each NMA varied, all five concluded that LAMA/LABA FDCs were generally comparable in terms of lung function improvements, patient-reported outcomes, and safety (where assessed). Conclusion: Although there were some inconsistencies between the outcomes of RCTs and NMAs for lung function, the totality of lung function, symptoms, exacerbations, and safety data suggests that currently available LAMA/LABA FDCs have comparable efficacy and safety in patients with COPD and moderate-to-very severe airflow limitation.";https://www.dovepress.com/efficacy-and-safety-of-lamalaba-fixed-dose-combination-therapies-in-ch-peer-reviewed-article-COPD;4.5;4.7;4.9;;32669839;;;;

All rights reserved.Background:Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived vesicles with diverse functions in intercellular communication including disease and infection, and EVs seem to influence HIV-1 pathogenesis. EVs isolated from HIV-1-uninfected semen (SE), but not blood (BE), contain factors that interfere with HIV-1 infection and replication in target cells. The reason for this dichotomy is unknown. Furthermore, the effect of HIV-1 infection and antiretroviral (ARV) drugs on the anti-HIV-1 effects of SE and BE is unknown. Here, we characterize EVs and EV-free plasma isolated from HIV-infected donor semen and blood and their effects on HIV infection.Methods:EVs and EV-free plasma were purified from autologous blood and semen of HIV-negative, HIV-infected antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve, and HIV-infected ART-treated participants. HIV infection was assessed in a TZM-bl cell reporter system. ARV concentrations were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.Results:SE isolated from both HIV-negative and HIV-infected, ART-naïve donors inhibited HIV-1 infection, but BE and semen and blood EV-free plasma did not. By contrast, BE, SE, and EV-free plasma from HIV-infected, ART-treated donors inhibited HIV-1. Importantly, exosomes isolated from ART-treated donors contained concentrations of ARV drugs (ART-EVs) at biologically relevant inhibitory levels.Conclusions:The HIV-1-inhibitory phenotype of SE is independent of donor HIV-1 or ART status, and ARV drugs and their metabolites are SE- and BE-associated in vivo.;http://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAI.0000000000002233;6.9;7.0;6.4;;31809364;;;;

Nodal FDCS is well-recognized. However, when it occurs at an extranodal site, it may not be recognized and is often misdiagnosed. These tumors exhibit a variable spindle to epithelioid cell morphology with a lymphocytic infiltrate and a distinct immunophenotype. The World Health Organization has classified this entity under tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue, that is, histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms. However, its occurrence at extranodal sites and its behavior and management more closely resemble that of a soft tissue tumor. Increased awareness about the existence of FDCS at extranodal sites may aid in the reduction of diagnostic errors. We wish to draw attention to this entity by reporting our experience of 54 cases of extranodal FDCS encountered over a period of 14 years and present a review of the literature of this underrecognized entity. We also describe the ontogeny and molecular pathogenesis of this uncommon lesion.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/PAP.0000000000000281;5.1;5.0;5.6;;32991350;;;;

Ethiopia is one of the most seriously affected countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with a large number of people who are living with HIV/AIDS and AIDS-related deaths. Prevention of the virus transmission through the appropriate utilization of post exposure prophylaxis is one of the major strategies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the utilization of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) among victims of HIV at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, north-west Ethiopia. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from May 17, 2018, to May 24, 2018 and descriptive statistics were carried out to analyze the Data using SPSS version 20. Results: From a total of 309 patients PEP was prescribed during the study period, of whom 239 (77.34%) were occupational victims and 55 (17.8%) were rape victims, with one missing data. Occupational victims were exposed by blood and blood product splashes and nurses and physicians were exposed almost equally, 14.24% and 13.92%, respectively. The majority of the victims were exposed at a health facility. Two hundred and eighty-five (92.23%) victims received prescriptions containing three-drug regimens, tenofovir + lamivudine + efavirenz, followed by 9 victims (2.91%) with two-drug regimens; zidovudine + lamivudine.

This study also evaluated the reasons for early treatment discontinuation. Materials and Methods: This retrospective observational study included patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and erectile dysfunction who started an FDC treatment of tadalafil (5 mg) and tamsulosin (0.4 mg) between July 2017 and February 2018. Treatment persistence and reasons for early discontinuation were evaluated during the first 6 months. The cumulative discontinuation rate and differences in various parameters were assessed using Kaplan–Meier analysis and the log-rank test, respectively. Factors related to persistence were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard model. Results: Overall, 97 patients were included in the study. The cumulative persistence rate at 30, 90, and 180 days was 88.7%, 66.0%, and 54.6%, respectively. The cumulative persistence over 6 months differed significantly according to the administration of FDC therapy (log-rank p=0.005) and age (log-rank p=0.024). Younger patients (odds ratio, 2.049; p=0.021) and treatment-naive patients (odds ratio, 2.461; p=0.006) were more likely to discontinue therapy within 6 months. The common reasons for discontinuing therapy were side effects (63.6%) and perceived poor efficacy (22.7%). Conclusions: Side effects were reported to be the main reason for treatment discontinuation. Thus, to improve compliance for a once-daily FDC of tadalafil (5 mg) and tamsulosin (0.4 mg), it is recommended to select patients who show adaptation to a combination of -blockers and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors prior to FDC treatment.";https://icurology.org/DOIx.php?id=10.4111/icu.2020.61.1.81;1.4;2.3;3.1;;31942467;;;;

It is unclear whether long-acting 2-agonist (LABA)/LAMA fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) are more effective than LAMAs alone in preventing exacerbations. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature to investigate whether LABA/LAMA FDCs are more effective than LAMA monotherapy in preventing exacerbations. Methods: We searched several databases and manufacturers’ websites to identify relevant randomized clinical trials comparing LABA/LAMA FDC treatment with LAMAs alone 24 weeks. Outcomes of interest were time to first exacerbation and rates of moderate to severe, severe and all exacerbations. Results: We included 10 trials in 9 articles from 2013 to 2018 with a total of 19,369 patients for analysis in this study. Compared with LAMA monotherapy, LABA/LAMA FDCs demonstrated similar efficacy in terms of time to first exacerbation [hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79–1.18; p = 0.71], moderate to severe exacerbations [risk ratio (RR), 0.96; 95% CI 0.90–1.03; p = 0.28], severe exacerbations (RR, 0.92; 95% CI 0.81–1.03; p = 0.15), and a marginal superiority in terms of all exacerbations (RR, 0.92; 95% CI 0.86–1.00; p = 0.04). The incidence of all exacerbation events was lower in the LABA/LAMA FDC group for the COPD patients with a history of previous exacerbations and those with a longer treatment period (52–64 weeks). Conclusion: This study provides evidence that LABA/LAMA FDCs are marginally superior in the prevention of all exacerbations compared with LAMA monotherapy in patients with COPD.

CARBONE Editore. All rights reserved.Introduction: Most of the high tuberculosis (TB) burden countries around the world have used Fixed-dose combination (FDC). However, there are few studies on the dose and dosage form of FDC in the Chinese population. We aimed to evaluate the clinical effect of FDC in anti-tuberculosis and choose an appropriate treatment regime for Chinese population. Materials and methods: Between July 1, 2011 and December 31, 2012, the newly diagnosed pulmonary TB patients from Hebei Province (n=1227) and Jilin Province (n=1130) were included in the study. A total of 2357 participants were given FDC treatment for six months (intensive phase-2 months of isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide; continuation phase-4months of rifampicin and isoniazid). The two provinces used two different schemes from the dose of drug. These schemes were assessed the drug compliance of tuberculosis patients, drug substitution and ADRs. Results: In the statistical analysis, the curing rate was 94.81% (512/540) meanwhile, successfully completed the treatment and the treatment success rate was accounted for 93.4% (1146/1227) of all patients in Hebei; the curing rate was 92.49% (345/373). Meanwhile, successfully completed the treatment and the treatment success rate was accounted for 98.1%(1109/1130) of all patients in Jilin. The cure rate in Hebei Province was superior to Jilin Province. However, the effective rate in Hebei Province was inferior to Jilin Province at the end of chemotherapy for TB. Conclusion: This study found that the curing treatment for pulmonary TB patients in Hebei province was superior to Jilin province. Whereas the analysis showed that the ADRs of Jilin province was inferior to the ADRs of Hebei Province. The anti-tuberculosis effect of FDC should be further studied in large samples in the future.";http://www.actamedicamediterranea.com/archive/2020/medica-2/comparison-of-clinical-effect-of-fixed-dose-combination-for-tuberculosis-treatment-in-hebei-and-jilin-province-china;1.1;1.6;1.2;;;;;;

In this randomized, open-label, single-dose, 2-treatment, 2-way crossover study, healthy Korean volunteers received a single dose of candesartan (16 mg) with amlodipine (10 mg) as either an FDC or single agents concomitantly administered, with a 2-week washout period. Serial blood samples were collected up to 72 hours after dosing for each treatment period, and plasma concentrations of candesartan and amlodipine were measured using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. A total of 39 subjects completed the study. The geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last measurement (AUC0-t) and the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) for candesartan were 1.0182 (0.9562–1.0841) and 0.9492 (0.8726–1.0324), respectively. The GMR and 90% CI for the AUC0-t and Cmax for amlodipine were 1.0552 (1.0255–1.0857) and 1.0668 (1.0259–1.1094), respectively. In conclusion, the new FDC formulation of candesartan (16 mg) and amlodipine (10 mg) was bioequivalent to the concomitant administration of single agents. A single dose of candesartan/amlodipine as the FDC or as single agents was well tolerated.;https://tcpharm.org/DOIx.php?id=10.12793/tcp.2020.28.e8;0.3;0.3;0.5;;;;;;

The peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of fimasartan and atorvastatin has a large intra-subject variability with a maximum coefficient of variation of 65% and 48%, respectively. Therefore, both drugs are classified as highly variable drugs. The purpose of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) between a FDC of fimasartan 120 mg and atorvastatin 40 mg versus separate tablets in healthy male Korean subjects. Subjects and Methods: A randomized, single-dose, two-treatment, three-sequence, three-period, partial replicated crossover study was conducted with a 7-day washout interval between periods. Blood samples for fimasartan and atorvastatin were collected until 48 hours after administration in each period. PK parameters were calculated using the non-compartmental method. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) for PK parameters of FDC to loose combination and their 90% confidence intervals (90% CIs) were estimated. Results: A total of 56 subjects completed the study. GMRs (90% CIs) of the Cmax for fimasartan and atorvastatin were 1.08 (0.93–1.24) and 1.02 (0.92–1.13), respectively. The expanded 90% CIs of both drugs using the intra-subject variability was calculated range of 0.70–1.43 and 0.73–1.38, respectively. The corresponding values of area under the concen-tration–time curve from zero to the last measurable time point were 1.02 (0.97–1.08) and 1.02 (0.98–1.07), respectively.

There is a lack of data on real-world use of non-statin lipid-lowering therapies (LLT) and little is known on the effectiveness of fixed-dose combinations (FDC). We therefore studied prescription trends in oral non-statin LLT and their effects on LDL-C. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of electronic medical records of outpatients at very-high cardiovascular risk treated by general practitioners (GPs) and cardiologists, and prescribed LLT in Germany between 2013 and 2018. Results: Data from 311,242 patients were analysed. Prescriptions for high-potency statins (atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) increased from 10.4% and 25.8% of patients treated by GPs and cardiologists, respectively, in 2013, to 34.7% and 58.3% in 2018. Prescription for non-statin LLT remained stable throughout the period and low especially for GPs. Ezetimibe was the most prescribed non-statin LLT in 2018 (GPs, 76.1%; cardiologists, 92.8%). Addition of ezetimibe in patients already prescribed a statin reduced LDL-C by an additional 23.8% (32.3 ± 38.4 mg/dL), with a greater reduction with FDC [reduction 28.4% (40.0 ± 39.1 mg/dL)] as compared to separate pills [19.4% (27.5 ± 33.8 mg/dL)]; p < 0.0001. However, only a small proportion of patients reached the recommended LDL-C level of < 70 mg/dL (31.5% with FDC and 21.0% with separate pills). Conclusions: Prescription for high-potency statins increased over time. Non-statin LLT were infrequently prescribed by GPs. The reduction in LDL-C when statin and ezetimibe were prescribed in combination was considerably larger for FDC; however, a large proportion of patients still remained with uncontrolled LDL-C levels.

HIV Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British HIV AssociationObjectives: The current World Health Organization and Uganda Ministry of Health HIV treatment guidelines recommend that asymptomatic patients who have a viral load (VL)  1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL should receive adherence counselling and repeat VL testing before switching to second-line therapy. We evaluated the effectiveness of this strategy in a large HIV treatment programme of The AIDS Support Organisation Jinja in Jinja, Uganda. Methods: We measured the HIV VL at enrolment, and for participants with VL  1000 copies/mL we informed them of their result, offered enhanced adherence counselling and repeated the VL measurement after 3 months. All blood samples with VL  1000 copies/mL were sequenced in the polymerase (pol) region, a 1257-bp fragment spanning the protease and reverse transcriptase genes. Results: One thousand and ninety-one participants were enrolled in the study; 74.7% were female and the median age was 44 years [interquartile range (IQR) 39–50 years]. The median time on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at enrolment was 6.75 years (IQR 5.3–7.6 years) and the median CD4 cell count was 494 cells/L (IQR 351–691 cells/L). A total of 113 participants (10.4%) had VLs  1000 copies/mL and were informed of the VL result and its implications and given adherence counselling. Of these 113 participants, 102 completed 3 months of follow-up and 93 (91%) still had VLs  1000 copies/mL. We successfully genotyped HIV for 105 patients (93%) and found that 103 (98%) had at least one mutation: eight (7.6%) had only one mutation, 94 (89.5%) had two mutations and one sample (1%) had three mutations. Conclusions: In this study, enhanced adherence counselling was not effective in reversing virologically defined treatment failure for patients on long-term ART who had not previously had a VL test.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hiv.12790;5.6;5.3;5.8;;31432614;;;;

In a multi-national parallel prospective-cohort study, we investigated the impact of population and pharmacogenetic variations for efavirenz pharmacokinetics, auto-induction, and immunologic outcome during antituberculosis treatment. A total of 921 treatment-naïve HIV patients with (196 Ethiopians and 231 Tanzanians) or without TB co-infection (285 Ethiopians and 209 Tanzanians) were enrolled and treated with efavirenz-based cART. TB-HIV patients started rifampicin-based anti-TB therapy 4 weeks before cART. Efavirenz plasma concentrations were measured on the 4th and 16th weeks of cART. Genotyping for CYP2B6, CYP3A5, ABCB1, UGT2B7, and SLCO1B1 was done. CD4 cells-count was measured at baseline, 12th, 24th, and 48th weeks of cART. Among HIV-only cohort, plasma efavirenz concentration and median CD4 cell count were significantly higher in Tanzanians than Ethiopians, and both CYP2B6 genotype and population-variation were significant predictors of efavirenz plasma concentration. Within-population analyses indicated a pronounced efavirenz autoinduction in Tanzanians as reflected by a significant decrease of plasma efavirenz concentration over time (p = 0.0001), but not in Ethiopians. Among TB-HIV cohort, there were no significant between-population differences in plasma efavirenz concentrations or CD4 cell-recovery, and CYP2B6 genotype but not population-variation was a significant predictor of efavirenz plasma exposure. In Tanzanian patients, short-term anti-TB co-treatment significantly reduced the mean plasma efavirenz concentration in CYP2B6*1/*1 genotype at week-4 (p = 0.005), but not at week-16 of cART. In Ethiopian patients, anti-TB cotreatment increased the mean plasma efavirenz concentration among CYP2B6*6 carriers at week-4 (p = 0.003) and week-16 (p = 0.035) of cART. In general, long-term anti-TB co-treatment increased plasma efavirenz concentration at week 16 of cART in both Ethiopians and Tanzanians being higher in CYP2B6*6/*6 > *1/*6 > *1/*1 genotypes. In TB-HIV patients, baseline body mass index (BMI), viral load, and WHO clinical-stage but not genotype, population-variation, or efavirenz concentration were significant predictors of immunologic outcome at week-48. In summary efavirenz auto-induction, pharmacokinetics, and the immunologic outcome are influenced by population-variation, anti-TB co-medication, and CYP2B6 genotype. CYP2B6 genotype is a significant predictor of efavirenz plasma exposure regardless of population-variation or antituberculosis co-treatment, but population-variation is insignificant during antituberculosis treatment. CYP2B6 genotype, population, and geographic differences need to be considered for efavirenz dosage-optimization.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fphar.2020.00026/full;4.7;3.9;5.0;;;26;;;

To detect the potential for incompatibility and to assess formulation stability, it is beneficial to conduct a compatibility study during the drug development phase. The therapy of tuberculosis normally consists of two or more medicines taken together. Consequently, different antituberculotic fixed-dose combination (FDC) formulations have been developed. Isoniazid is first-line medicine and present in several FDCs. Low bioavailability due to the active substances’ incompatibility in acidic medium was reported for some of these FDC forms. Rifabutin, also a first-line antituberculotic, is available in the market as a single component formulation. This study presents compatibility testing of these two active substances for a new FDC and evaluates the impact of the most common solid dosage forms’ excipients on the stability of two active substances. The potential for interaction between the formulation components was analyzed by the UHPLC method. One degradation product and one interaction product were observed and further characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Still, significant degradation of two active substances, such as reported in marketed FDC formulations was not detected for this combination. The stability and drug delivery of the proposed combination were confirmed by the dissolution test in acidic medium.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03639045.2020.1788066;3.8;4.0;4.2;;32597312;;;;

Since regulatory requirements were relaxed in 2005, 73 new FDCs have been approved by PMDA since 2006. In this study, we investigate trends in new FDCs and their benefits through a questionnaire survey provided to patients and pharmacists. Methods: The new FDCs were analyzed by therapeutic categories, first approval country and drug lag (DL). Questionnaire surveys were conducted on hypertension, bronchial asthma, and glaucoma in approximately 300 patients and 700 pharmacists in 66 hospitals to investigate the benefits of new FDCs. Results: The highest number of FDCs approved by the therapeutic category was 15 cardiovascular agents. The DL (median) was less than 1 year in several therapeutic categories including cardiovascular agents. The survey results showed that patient compliance improved in 30.8% of the bronchial asthma. Regarding the time and effort required to prescribe these drugs, 32.5% of pharmacists reported “slightly decreased” in bronchial asthma, while 32.0% reported “slightly increased” in hypertension. More than one-third (70.6%) responded “recommend” in bronchial asthma. Conclusion: The number of new FDCs markedly increased since 2006, and this presented new opportunities for the Japanese pharmaceutical industry. FDCs not only increase convenience to the patient but also improve patient compliance and the efficiency of pharmacist prescription processes. However, the rapid increase in new FDCs may cause confusion in the medical field, and new FDCs should be developed not only to improve convenience but also to consider the benefits they provide to patients, pharmacists, and physicians.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s43441-019-00046-w;1.5;1.6;1.7;;32008249;;;;

Four open-label, randomized, 2-period, single-dose, crossover studies were conducted under fasted conditions in healthy subjects to demonstrate bioequivalence of the ertugliflozin/metformin FDC tablets and coadministration of the individual components at respective strengths. In each study, 32 or 34 subjects received an ertugliflozin/metformin FDC tablet (2.5 mg/500 mg, 7.5 mg/850 mg, or 7.5 mg/1000 mg) and the respective doses of individual components (ertugliflozin with US- or EU-sourced metformin [Glucophage]). Plasma samples for ertugliflozin and metformin concentrations were collected for 72 hours in each period. For both ertugliflozin and metformin, the 90% confidence intervals for the adjusted geometric mean ratio (FDC : coadministration) for area under the plasma concentration–time profile from time zero extrapolated to infinity and maximum observed plasma concentration were within acceptance criteria for bioequivalence. The majority of adverse events were mild in intensity. The studies demonstrated that each strength of FDC tablet is bioequivalent to respective doses of coadministered individual components, supporting that safety and efficacy can be bridged to the individual components used in phase 3 studies evaluating ertugliflozin in combination with metformin.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpdd.703;2.4;3.0;3.2;;31207178;;;;

The comparative pharmacokinetic study was performed to compare the profile of an FDC tablet formulation of amlodipine/losartan/rosuvastatin with that of concomitant administration of a currently marketed FDC tablet of amlodipine/losartan with a rosuvastatin tablet. Subjects and Methods: A randomized, open-label, single oral dose, two-way crossover study was conducted in 60 healthy subjects. Subjects were orally administered the FDC tablet of amlodipine/losartan/rosuvastatin and a loose combination (LC) of two tablets comprising an FDC of amlodipine/losartan and rosuvastatin. Blood samples were collected for up to 144 h post dose for pharmacokinetic evaluations. Plasma concentrations of amlodipine, losartan, EXP3174 (an active metabolite of losartan), and rosuvastatin were measured by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) and its 90% confidence interval (90% CI) in the FDC treatment to LC treatment for the area under the concentration-time curve from zero to the last quantifiable time point (AUClast) and the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) were calculated. Safety was monitored throughout the study. Results: The GMR (90% CI) values of AUClast and Cmax were 0.9946 (0.9663–1.0238) and 0.9690 (0.9379–1.0011) for amlodipine, 0.9855 (0.9422–1.0308) and 0.9178 (0.8349–-1.0089) for losartan, 0.9814 (0.9501–1.0136) and 0.9756 (0.9313–1.0219) for EXP3174, and 0.9448 (0.8995–0.9923) and 0.9609 (0.8799–1.0494) for rosuvastatin, respectively. No clinically significant changes were observed in any of the safety parameters, including clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and physical examinations, between the FDC treatment and the LC treatment. Conclusion: We confirmed the pharmacokinetic equivalence of the FDC and LC treatments.

However, there are several reasons as to why patients may discontinue their antiretroviral therapy, with adverse events being one of the main reasons reported in the literature. This is a case-control nested in a cohort of people living with HIV/AIDS, conducted to identify the incidence of ART modification due to adverse events and the associated factors, in two referral services in Recife, Brazil, between 2011 and 2014. Of the modifications occurred in the first year of ART, 25.7% were driven by adverse events. The median time elapsed between initiating ART and the first modification due to adverse events was 70.5 days (95% CI: 26-161 days). The main adverse events were dermatological, neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal. Dermatological events were the earliest to appear after initiating ART. Efavirenz was the most prescribed and most modified drug during the study period. The group of participants who used zidovudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz had a 2-fold greater chance (adjusted OR: 2.16 95% CI: 1.28-3.65) of switching ART due to adverse events when compared to the group that used tenofovir with lamivudine and efavirenz.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1413867019304842;2.5;3.0;3.2;S1413867019304842;31835018;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1413867019304842;;

Methods: In this single-arm, open-label study, HIV-positive adults who had undetectable plasma HIV RNA load (<50 copies/ml) for 6 months or longer while receiving co-formulated TDF, FTC, and 600-mg EFV with EFV C12 of 1 mg/L were enrolled. The participants were switched to co-formulated TDF, 3TC, and 400-mg EFV and followed for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with EFV C12  1 mg/L at Week 4. The secondary endpoints included virologic response and change of CD4 lymphocyte count up to Week 24. Specific adverse effects associated with EFV were recorded before and after the switch. Results: From December 2018 to January 2019, 50 participants were enrolled. EFV C12 remained 1 mg/L in 48 (96.0%) participants with a median reduction of 38.9% (interquartile range 29.0–44.4) at Week 4 after switch. All participants had undetectable plasma HIV RNA by Week 12, whereas 96.0% of them remained so at Week 24. Significant increases of CD4 lymphocyte count were observed at Weeks 12 and 24. Thirty-three participants (66.0%) reported improvement of pre-existing adverse effects.

Methods: Studies AC-077-101 and AC-077-103 were single-centre, open-label, single-dose, 2-period, randomized, crossover Phase 1 studies conducted in healthy subjects. Two FDCs were investigated: FDC-1 and FDC-2 in Study AC-077-101 and FDC-2 in Study AC-077-103. Both FDCs contained 10 mg/40 mg of macitentan/tadalafil and differed in excipients and coating materials used. In both studies, pharmacokinetic sampling over 216 hours was conducted, and pharmacokinetic parameters were derived using noncompartmental methods. Results: Bioequivalence of macitentan, its active metabolite ACT-132577, and tadalafil was established for FDC-2 in both studies AC-077-101 and AC-077-103 in which tadalafil as a single component was sourced from the USA and EU, respectively, to fulfil regional regulatory requirements. The area under the plasma concentration–time curve and maximum plasma concentration with 90% confidence intervals of all components were entirely within the bioequivalence limits (0.8000–1.2500). No subject died and no serious adverse events were reported in either studies. Conclusion: The FDC-2 tablet containing 10 mg/40 mg of macitentan/tadalafil was bioequivalent to the free combination of 10 mg macitentan and 40 mg tadalafil (both US and EU sourced). Macitentan and tadalafil were well tolerated when administered as FDC or as a free combination.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bcp.14347;7.1;7.0;6.9;;32374030;;;;

Early initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) decreases human immunodeficiency virus- (HIV-) related complications, restores patients' immunity, decreases viral load, and substantially improves quality of life. However, antiretroviral treatment failure considerably impedes the merits of HAART. Objective. This study is aimed at determining the prevalence of immunologic and clinical antiretroviral treatment failure. Methods. A cross-sectional study design using clinical and immunologic treatment failure definition was used to conduct the study. Sociodemographic characteristics and clinical features of patients were retrieved from patients' medical registry between the years 2009 and 2015. All patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria in the study period were studied. Predictors of treatment failure were identified using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox regression analysis. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 21 software, and the level of statistical significance was declared at a p value < 0.05. Results. A total of 770 were studied. The prevalence of treatment failure was 4.5%. The AZT-based regimen (AHR=16.95, 95% CI: 3.02-95.1, p=0.001), baseline CD4 count301 (AHR=0.199, 95% CI: 0.05-0.76, p=0.018), and bedridden during HAART initiation (AHR=0.131, 95% CI: 0.029-0.596, p=0.009) were the predictors of treatment failure. Conclusion. The prevalence of treatment failure was lower with the risk being higher among patients on the AZT-based regimen. On the other hand, the risk of treatment failure was lower among patients who started HAART at baseline CD4 count301 and patients who were bedridden during HAART initiation. We recommend further prospective, multicenter cohort studies to be conducted to precisely detect the prevalence of treatment failure using viral load determination in the whole country.;https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/5474103/;5.1;4.3;3.6;;32462003;5474103;;;

To assess the safety and impact, if any, coencapsulation might have on ARV concentrations, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics of ARVs coencapsulated with an ingestible sensor for eight commonly used fixed-dose combination ARVs: emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF); FTC/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF); efavirenz (EFV)/FTC/TDF; abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC); dolutegravir (DTG)/ABC/3TC; rilpivirine (RPV)/TAF/FTC; elvitegravir (EVG)/cobicistat (COBI)/FTC/TAF; and bictegravir (BIC)/FTC/TAF. The steady-state apparent peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-Time curve (AUC) were determined from plasma concentrations measured at predose, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h postdose, and compared with literature values. A total of 49 unique patients on stable regimens for at least 12 weeks with undetectable viral loads were recruited. Cmax and AUC values were not statistically significantly different from literature values for all of the formulations except the Cmax of FTC/TDF, Cmax of BIC, and the Cmax of RPV. In a subsequent evaluation of FTC/TDF and BIC/FTC/TAF using a crossover design, the geometric mean ratio (GMR) between the coencapsulated and the unencapsulated formulations for FTC/TDF were the following: FTC, 84.6% (90% confidence interval [CI] 66.6-107.4) for AUC and 77.5% (60.1-99.9) for Cmax. For tenofovir (TFV), the GMR was 96.2% (90% CI 89.2-103.8) for AUC and 87.3% (64.2-118.7) for Cmax. The GMR for BIC (from the BIC/FTC/TAF formulation) was 98.0% (90% CI 84.5-113.5) for AUC and 89.9% (84.5-95.7) for Cmax. The observed deviation in FTC/TDF (Truvada) may be due to participant characteristics, fasted/fed conditions, and/or random variation and may warrant further investigations with a larger sample size. These findings provide assurance for use of coencapsulated ARVs for future HIV treatment-Adherence research.";https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2019.0202;3.3;3.2;3.4;;31516025;;;;

The product was also approved in the E.U. and Japan in November 2018 and January 2020, respectively. It is currently available as a single stand-alone tablet as well as part of a single-tablet regimen in a fixed-dose combination with tenofovir disoproxil and lamivudine. Similarly to other NNRTIs, doravirine exerts its antiviral effect through a noncompetitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. It has a novel resistance pathway so that it retains in vitro activity against clinically relevant NNRTI viral mutations K103N, Y181C and G190A. In randomized clinical trials, doravirine was noninferior to efavirenz- and darunavir-based regimens, with fewer adverse events. Doravirine has a more favorable drug interaction profile compared with earlier NNRTIs as it neither inhibits nor induces the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme. Doravirine has been added to the category of Recommended Initial Regimens in Certain Clinical Situations in the United States Department of Health and Human Services Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents.;http://journals.prous.com/journals/servlet/xmlxsl/pk_journals.xml_summary_pr?p_JournalId=4&p_RefId=3109966&p_IsPs=N;2.3;2.2;2.0;;32163527;;;;

Significant improvements in antiretroviral therapy have led to a transformation in its management. No curative treatment is available for HIV, and lifelong therapy is required with a combination of agents to control viral replication and prevent complications. Some of the older agents are notorious for many side effects, making patient compliance difficult, which is critical to preventing HIV resistance. Tenofovir is one of the newer, more tolerable, nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors on the market; is a mainstay of many antiretroviral therapy combinations; and is now available in 2 different formulations, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and, the more recent, tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). These 2 formulations have very different pharmacokinetics, which seem to affect their efficacy and safety. This manuscript provides insight into the history of TDF and TAF development, their unique pharmacokinetics and pharmacology, clinically important adverse effects, monitoring, interactions, resistance, review of clinical studies, and guideline recommendations and clinical applications for tenofovir’s various indications.";http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2325958220919231;2.3;2.3;1.8;;32295453;;;;

Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is a fixed-dose combination of an NS3/4A protease inhibitor and an NS5A inhibitor approved for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection, including patients with HIV coinfection. METHODS: A series of phase 1 studies was conducted to evaluate potential interactions of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir with elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine, raltegravir, rilpivirine, atazanavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, or efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Pharmacokinetics of the antiretrovirals and DAAs were characterized when administered alone and in combination to quantify changes in systemic drug exposure. RESULTS: Glecaprevir area under the curve increased >4-fold in the presence of ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitors, while pibrentasvir concentrations were not significantly affected; elevations in alanine transaminase occurred in combination with atazanavir/ritonavir only. Exposures of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir may be significantly decreased by efavirenz. Coadministration with glecaprevir and pibrentasvir did not result in clinically significant changes in the exposure of any antiretroviral agents. CONCLUSIONS: Atazanavir is contraindicated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and use of boosted protease inhibitors or efavirenz is not recommended. No clinically significant interactions were observed with other studied antiretrovirals.";https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/221/2/223/5556482;10.4;9.2;9.0;;31504702;;;;

A cross-sectional study was conducted in Yongzhou city, China. All PLWH older than 50 years listed on the registry of Centres for Disease Control and Prevention were invited to join the study. Frequency matching was used to sample HIV-negative controls according to the distribution of age, sex, and years of formal education of older PLWH. A total of 308 older PLWH and 350 HIV-negative controls completed the face-to-face interview and neurocognitive assessment using the comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. After adjusting for significant confounders, older PLWH taking EFV showed poorer performance in memory (p = 0.020), verbal fluency (p = 0.002), and poorer global neurocognitive performance (p = 0.032) than those without EFV use. Compared to HIV-negative controls, older PLWH taking EFV had poorer performance in all neurocognitive domains (p values: <0.001–0.003) and poorer global neurocognitive performance (p < 0.001). Similar trends were observed when comparing older PLWH without using EFV versus HIV-negative controls, with the exception of verbal fluency (p = 0.560). Health care workers should monitor the neuropsychological performance of older PLWH, epically those who were taking EFV.

The purpose was to generate nanonized SIM and EZE dispersed in matrix of single crystallization inducing excipient and investigate their in vitro performance. DNEM were prepared using mannitol (MAN) as crystallization inducer (active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs)/MAN = 3:7 w/w) using spray drying. TPGS (0.1% w/v) was used as surfactant for stabilization of nanocrystals. Crystallinity of DNEM was confirmed by solid-state characterization using DSC and PXRD. Particle size analysis was carried out using Zetasizer® and the Scherrer equation as primary techniques and SEM and TEM as orthogonal techniques. Size of both SIM and EZE in DNEM was close to 600 nm. In vitro performance was assessed using USP apparatus II in 0.025% SLS containing sodium phosphate buffer. Powder dissolution of DNEM increased 1.45 times for SIM and 1.65 times for EZE as compared to their physical mixture in discriminatory medium.

Existing methods cannot simultaneously consider common and individual characteristics among/within subjects when extracting stimulus-elicited brain activities from ongoing EEG elicited by 512-s long modern tango music. New method: Aiming to discover the commonly music-elicited brain activities among subjects, we provide a comprehensive framework based on fast double-coupled nonnegative tensor decomposition (FDC-NTD) algorithm. The proposed algorithm with a generalized model is capable of simultaneously decomposing EEG tensors into common and individual components. Results: With the proposed framework, the brain activities can be effectively extracted and sorted into the clusters of interest. The proposed algorithm based on the generalized model achieved higher fittings and stronger robustness. In addition to the distribution of centro-parietal and occipito-parietal regions with theta and alpha oscillations, the music-elicited brain activities were also located in the frontal region and distributed in the 411 Hz band. Comparison with existing method(s): The present study, by providing a solution of how to separate common stimulus-elicited brain activities using coupled tensor decomposition, has shed new light on the processing and analysis of ongoing EEG data in multi-subject level. It can also reveal more links between brain responses and the continuous musical stimulus. Conclusions: The proposed framework based on coupled tensor decomposition can be successfully applied to group analysis of ongoing EEG data, as it can be reliably inferred that those brain activities we obtained are associated with musical stimulus.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165027019303590;5.4;5.4;4.8;S0165027019303590;31730873;108502;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0165027019303590;;

The study was carried out in three different river basins with three different climatic characteristics, namely the West-Seti River Basin in a sub-tropical (partially wet) climatic region, Sre Pok River Basin in a tropical (wet) climatic region and Hari Rod River Basin in a semi-arid (dry) climatic region. The SWAT and ANN models were evaluated using statistical indicators such as the correlation coefficient (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and percentage bias (PBIAS). The performance of ANN models was found to be very good with both R2 and NSE values greater than 0.95 for the training and validation periods in the West-Seti River Basin and Sre Pok River Basin. Whereas, in the Hari Rod River Basin, the performance of the SWAT model was good with both R2 and NSE values greater than 0.60 for the calibration and validation periods. Moreover, the performance of SWAT and ANN models was evaluated based on hydrological indicators (i.e. annual discharge, base flow, Qdry, and Qwet), during different flow periods (very high to very low flow) using flow duration curves (FDCs). The SWAT model was found to be better for low flow simulation and the ANN model performed better for high flow simulation in the three river basins.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0048969719342974;7.5;7.4;8.6;S0048969719342974;31704397;134308;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0048969719342974;;

We hypothesized that a comprehensive metabolomics approach discriminates across inhaled pharmacotherapies and that their effects on metabolomic signatures depend on the biological fluids analyzed. We performed metabolomics via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in exhaled breath condensate (EBC), sputum supernatants, serum, and urine. Fourteen patients suffering from COPD who were on regular inhaled fluticasone propionate/salmeterol therapy (visit 1) were consecutively treated with 2-week beclomethasone dipropionate/formoterol (visit 2), 4-week formoterol alone (visit 3), and 4-week beclomethasone/formoterol (visit 4). The comprehensive NMR-based metabolomics approach showed differences across all pharmacotherapies and that different biofluids provided orthogonal information. Serum formate was lower at visits 1 versus 3 (P = 0.03), EBC formate was higher at visit 1 versus 4 (P = 0.03), and urinary 1-methyl-nicotinamide was lower at 3 versus 4 visit (P = 0.002). NMR-based metabolomics of different biofluids distinguishes across inhaled pharmacotherapies, provides complementary information on the effects of an extrafine ICS/LABA FDC on metabolic fingerprints in COPD patients, and might be useful for elucidating the ICS mechanism of action.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00345;8.0;7.2;6.7;;31621329;;;;

We characterized their drug resistance mutations (DRM) and adherence profiles to learn how to better manage HIV drug resistance. A retrospective cohort study utilizing clinical data and stored samples. Patients received ART at three Nigerian treatment centres. Plasma samples stored when they were in VF were genotyped. Result: Of 126 patients with samples available, 57 were successfully genotyped. From ART initiation, the proportion of patients with adherence 90% increased steadily from 54% at first high viral load (VL) to 67% at confirmed VF, and 81% at time of re-suppressed VL. Sixteen (28%) patients had at least one DRM. Forty-six (81%) patients had full susceptibility to the three drugs in their first-line (1 L) regimen. Thirteen (23%) were resistant to at least one antiretroviral drug but three were resistant to drugs not used in Nigeria. Ten patients had resistance to their 1 L drug(s) and six were fully susceptible to the three drugs in the recommended second-line regimen. Conclusion: This cohort had little drug resistance mutations. We conclude that if adherence is not assured, patients could exhibit virologic failure without having developed mutations associated with drug resistance.;https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-020-1706-1;5.1;5.4;5.0;;31959116;17;;;

Although the impact of the interaction between these two organisms is not well understood, it is thought that the outcome of either disease may be negatively influenced by coinfection. Therefore, it is important to understand how current first-line antiretroviral therapies (ART) might impact Plasmodium infection in these regions. Here, we describe the effect of 18 antiretroviral compounds and of first-line ART on the blood and sporogonic stages of Plasmodium berghei in vitro and in vivo. We show that the combination zidovudine + lamivudine + lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), employed as first-line HIV treatment in the field, has a strong inhibitory activity on the sporogonic stages of P. berghei and that several non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) have a moderate effect on this stage of the parasite’s life cycle. Our results expose the effect of current first-line ART on Plasmodium infection and identify potential alternative therapies for HIV/AIDS that might impact malaria transmission.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2019.03048/full;5.0;5.6;6.4;;;3048;;;

Initial anticoagulant treatment is crucial for reducing mortality, preventing early recurrences, and improving long-term outcome. Treatment and patient disposition should be tailored to the severity of clinical presentation, to comorbidities, and to the potential to receive appropriate care in the outpatient setting. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) used in fixed doses without laboratory monitoring are the agents of choice for the treatment of acute VTE in the majority of patients. In comparison with conventional anticoagulation (parenteral anticoagulants followed by vitamin K antagonists), these agents showed improved safety (relative risk [RR] of major bleeding, 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-0.83) with a similar risk of recurrence (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.77-1.06). Vitamin K antagonists or low molecular weight heparins are still alternatives to DOACs for the treatment of VTE in specific patient categories such as those with severe renal failure or antiphospholipid syndrome, or cancer, respectively. In addition to therapeutic anticoagulation, probably less than 10% of patients require reperfusion by thrombolysis or interventional treatments; those patients are hemodynamically unstable with acute pulmonary embolism, and a minority of them have proximal limb-threatening deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The choice of treatment should be driven by the combination of evidence from clinical trials and by local expertise. The majority of patients with acute DVT and a proportion of selected hemodynamically stable patients with acute pulmonary embolism can be safely managed as outpatients.";https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/135/5/305/430068/Acute-treatment-of-venous-thromboembolism;18.1;18.0;18.6;;31917399;;;;

The pharmacology of treating ACOS is challenging in severe circumstances. Areas covered: This review evaluates the stepwise treatment of ACOS using pharmacological treatments used in both COPD and asthma. The most common medications involve the same inhalers used to treat COPD and asthma patients. Advanced stepwise therapies for ACOS patients are based on patient characteristics and biomarkers. Very few clinical trials exist that focus specifically on ACOS patients. Expert opinion: After inhalers, advanced therapies including phosphodiesterase inhibitors, macrolides, N-acetylcysteine and statin therapy for those ACOS patients with a COPD appearance and exacerbations are available. In atopic ACOS patients with exacerbations, advanced asthma therapies (leukotriene receptor antagonists and synthesis blocking agents.) are used. ACOS patients with elevated blood eosinophil/IgE levels are considered for immunotherapy or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies blocking specific Th2/Type-2 interleukins or IgE. Symptom control, stabilization/improvement in pulmonary function and reduced exacerbations are the metrics of success. More pharmacological trials of ACOS patients are needed to better understand which patients benefit from specific treatments.

We aimed to investigate whether on-demand PrEP was similarly effective among individuals with lower exposure to HIV risk. Methods: Participants in the ANRS IPERGAY trial were randomly assigned to receive PrEP (fixed-dose combination of 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and 200 mg emtricitabine per pill) or placebo. The primary endpoint was the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection. Pill uptake was assessed by counting returned pills at each follow-up and by estimating tenofovir concentration from frozen plasma samples. Participants were interviewed at each visit to assess the pattern of PrEP use. All participants enrolled in the modified intention-to-treat population of the double-blind phase of the ANRS IPERGAY trial were eligible for this post-hoc analysis. We calculated the total follow-up time for periods of less frequent sexual intercourse with high PrEP adherence (15 pills or fewer per month taken systematically or often during sexual intercourse). To estimate the time of HIV acquisition, fourth-generation HIV-1/2 ELISA assays, plasma HIV-1 RNA assays, and western blot analyses were done with use of frozen samples, and the stage of HIV infection was defined according to Fiebig staging. HIV incidence was compared between the two treatment groups among individuals who had less frequent sexual intercourse with high PrEP adherence. The ANRS IPERGAY trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01473472. Findings: 400 participants who were randomly assigned to receive PrEP (n=199) or placebo (n=201) between Feb 22, 2012, and Oct 17, 2014, were included in this analysis. 270 participants had at least one period of less frequent sexual intercourse with high PrEP adherence during the study, representing 134 person-years of follow-up and 31% of the total study follow-up. During these periods, participants in both groups reported a median of 5·0 (IQR 2·0–10·0) episodes of sexual intercourse per month and used a median of 9·5 (6·0–13·0) pills per month. Six HIV-1 infections were diagnosed in the placebo group (HIV incidence of 9·2 per 100 person-years; 95% CI 3·4–20·1) and none were diagnosed in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine arm (HIV incidence of 0 per 100 person-years; 0–5·4; p=0·013), with a relative reduction of HIV incidence of 100% (95% CI 39–100). Interpretation: A choice between daily or on-demand PrEP regimens could be offered to men who have sex with men who have less frequent sexual intercourse.

However, these have to be balanced against concerns including increased costs and their irrationality in some cases. Consequently, there is a need to review their value among lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs) which have the greatest prevalence of both infectious and noninfectious diseases and issues of affordability. Areas covered: Review of potential advantages, disadvantages, cost-effectiveness, and availability of FDCs in high priority disease areas in LMICs and possible initiatives to enhance the prescribing of valued FDCs and limit their use where there are concerns with their value. Expert commentary: FDCs are valued across LMICs. Advantages include potentially improved response rates, reduced adverse reactions, increased adherence rates, and reduced costs. Concerns include increased chances of drug:drug interactions, reduced effectiveness, potential for imprecise diagnoses and higher unjustified prices. Overall certain FDCs including those for malaria, tuberculosis, and hypertension are valued and listed in the country’s essential medicine lists, with initiatives needed to enhance their prescribing where currently low prescribing rates. Proposed initiatives include robust clinical and economic data to address the current paucity of pharmacoeconomic data. Irrational FDCs persists in some countries which are being addressed.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14737167.2020.1734456;3.0;3.0;3.3;;32237953;;;;

All rights reserved.This study aimed to characterize the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of ethambutol in tuberculosis-HIV-coinfected adult patients. Ethambutol plasma concentrations, determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, in 63 patients receiving ethambutol as part of rifampin-based fixed-dose combination therapy for tuberculosis were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. A one-compartment disposition model with first-order elimination and four transit compartments prior to first-order absorption was found to adequately describe the concentration-time profiles of ethambutol in plasma. Body weight was implemented as an allometric function on the clearance and volume parameters. Estimates of oral clearance and volume of distribution were 77.4 liters/h and 76.2 liters, respectively. A G/A mutation with regard to CYP1A2 2159 GA was associated with a 50% reduction in relative bioavailability. Simulations revealed that doses of 30 mg/kg of body weight and 50 mg/kg for G/G and G/A carriers, respectively, would result in clinically adequate exposure. The results presented here suggest that CYP1A2 polymorphism affects ethambutol exposure in this population and that current treatment guidelines may result in underexposure in patients coinfected with tuberculosis and HIV. Based on simulations, a dose increase from15 to 20 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg is suggested. However, the 50-mg/kg dose required to reach therapeutic exposure in G/A carriers may be inappropriate due to the dose-dependent toxicity of ethambutol. Additional studies are required to further investigate CYP450 polymorphism effects on ethambutol pharmacokinetics.;https://aac.asm.org/content/64/2/e01583-19;7.8;7.9;8.3;;31712201;e01583;;;

Objective: To evaluate efficacy and safety of GSP301 in patients with seasonal AR (SAR). Methods: In this phase 2, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients (12 years of age) with SAR were equally randomized to twice-daily GSP301 (olopatadine 665 g and mometasone 25 g), once-daily GSP301 (olopatadine 665 g and mometasone 50 g), twice-daily or once-daily olopatadine monotherapy (665 g), mometasone monotherapy (twice-daily 25 g or once-daily 50 g), or placebo for 14 days. The primary endpoint—mean change from baseline in morning and evening reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS)—was analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA; P <. 05 = statistically significant). Average morning and evening 12-hour instantaneous TNSS (iTNSS), ocular symptoms, individual symptoms, onset of action, quality of life, and adverse events (AEs) were also assessed. Results: A total of 1111 patients were randomized. Twice-daily GSP301 provided statistically significant and clinically meaningful rTNSS improvements vs placebo (P <. 001), twice-daily olopatadine (P =. 049), and mometasone (P =. 004). Similar significant improvements in iTNSS were observed with twice-daily GSP301 vs placebo (P <. 001) and twice-daily mometasone (P =. 007); improvements were not significant vs olopatadine (P =. 058). Once-daily GSP301 provided significant rTNSS and iTNSS improvements vs placebo and once-daily olopatadine (P <. 01, all) but improvements were not significant vs mometasone. Treatment-emergent AEs rates were 10.8%, 9.5%, and 8.2%, with twice-daily GSP301, once-daily GSP301, and placebo, respectively. Conclusion: Twice-daily GSP301 treatment was efficacious and well tolerated, providing statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in rTNSS (primary endpoint) vs placebo and both monotherapies.

As a result, cargoes carried by a large truck need to be transferred from the large truck to small ones at a freight distribution center (FDC) for the last few miles. This study aims to analyze the multiple equilibrium behaviors for auto travellers and one freight carrier under the CBLTRR. A link flow based generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) model is first developed to characterize mixed routing behaviors of these two types of users. In the model, auto travellers follow first Wardropian principle to find their individual shortest paths, while the freight carrier minimizes its total freight cost. We then proceed to explore the existence and uniqueness of pure strategy equilibrium, and reduction to variational inequality. When the pure strategy equilibrium does not exist or is intractable, we propose an approach to construct a mixed equilibrium with restricted action space (i.e., the path choice set) (called restricted mixed equilibrium). The restricted action space is formed based on recurring best-responses of two types of users which could reflect their actual interactive decisions of a non-cooperative traffic pattern evolution. A solution algorithm is developed to find those equilibriums. The developed models and solution algorithms are evaluated and their potential applications are illustrated through numerical experiments.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1366554519311172;6.3;6.9;8.1;S1366554519311172;;101829;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1366554519311172;;

Journal of Medical Virology Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Background: Elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) is a new generation, fixed-dose, combination antiviral drug used in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 1 or 4 infection. Our study evaluates the clinical efficacy and safety of EBR/GZR after its launch in Taiwan. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study. Patients who had received EBR/GZR for chronic HCV GT 1 between June 2017 and April 2018 were recruited. Patients’ age, sex, HCV GT, changes in HCV RNA level before and after treatment, sustained virologic response 12 weeks (SVR12) after the cessation of drug administration, side effects, and interaction effects were used to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety. Results: A total of 149 patients were recruited. Of them, 145 (97.3%) had HCV GT 1b, and the rest had HCV GT 1a; most of the EBR/GZR-related side effects in this study were mild. Three participants were discontinued because their alanine transaminase levels were elevated to over 10 times the upper limit of normal. The therapeutic effect analyses revealed a rapid virologic response rate of 95.3% and an SVR12 rate of 98%. Subgroup analyses performed using SVR12 as the outcome variable revealed three demographic factors HCV GT 1, hepatocellular carcinoma medical history, and noncirrhosis plus HCV RNA level. Conclusions: This study confirmed that EBR/GZR is safe and effective for treating patients with HCV GT 1 and exhibited excellent overall clinical efficacy in Taiwan. The therapeutic effects are unrelated to factors such as sex, HCV RNA level before treatment, and history of liver cirrhosis.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25605;3.8;3.9;4.0;;31599455;;;;

Methods: We conducted two studies to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of BGF MDI in patients with COPD: (i) a phase I, open-label, single and chronic (7-day) dosing study (NCT03250182) with one treatment arm (BGF MDI 320/18/9.6 g); and (ii) a PK sub-study of KRONOS (NCT02497001), a phase III, randomized, double-blind study in which patients received 24 weeks’ treatment with BGF MDI 320/18/9.6 g, glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate (GFF) MDI 18/9.6 g, budesonide/formoterol fumarate (BFF) MDI 320/9.6 g, or budesonide/formoterol fumarate dry powder inhaler (BUD/FORM DPI) 320/9 g. PK parameters in both studies included maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration–time curve from 0 to 12h (AUC0–12). Results: In the phase I PK study (30 patients), budesonide and glycopyrronium Cmax were comparable after single and chronic dosing of BGF MDI (accumulation ratio [RAC] 95% and 107%, respectively) whereas Cmax for formoterol was slightly higher after chronic dosing (RAC 116%). AUC0–12 for budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol were higher following chronic versus single dosing, with an RAC of 126%, 179%, and 143%, respectively. After 7 days’ dosing, AUC0–12 and Cmax for all three components of BGF MDI were similar to those in the KRONOS PK sub-study (202 patients) at Week 24. In the latter sub-study, Cmax and AUC0–12 at Week 24 were generally comparable across treatments for budesonide (geometric mean ratios [GMR] of 96%–109% for BGF MDI vs BFF MDI or BUD/FORM DPI), glycopyrronium (GMR of 88%–100% for BGF MDI vs GFF MDI), and formoterol (GMR of 80%–113% for BGF MDI vs GFF MDI or BFF MDI). Conclusions: Steady-state PK parameters of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol were similar after 7 days’ dosing in the phase I PK study and after 24 weeks in the KRONOS PK sub-study.

One strategy for overcoming resistance to EGFR inhibition is concomitant inhibition of downstream signaling. The antidiabetic drug metformin inhibits both MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling. We evaluated the combination of erlotinib and metformin in a phase 1 study of patients with mTNBC. Patients and Methods: Patients with mTNBC who had received at least one prior line of therapy for metastatic disease were eligible. Erlotinib dose was fixed at 150 mg daily. Metformin dose escalation was planned according to a 3 + 3 design. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were assessed during the first 5 weeks of therapy. The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose of metformin with fixed-dose erlotinib. Secondary endpoints were response rate, stable disease rate, and progression-free survival. Results: Eight patients were enrolled. The median number of prior therapies for metastatic disease was 2.5 (range, 1-6). No DLT events were reported during the DLT assessment period. Most adverse events were grade 1/2. Grade 3 diarrhea despite maximum supportive care required dose reduction of metformin in one patient. Grade 3 rash led to study withdrawal in one patient. No grade 4 adverse events were reported. The best observed response was stable disease in 2 patients (25%). Median progression-free survival was 60 days (range, 36-61 days). Conclusion: Erlotinib and metformin were well tolerated in a population of pretreated mTNBC patients but did not demonstrate efficacy in this population.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1526820919306639;4.3;3.6;3.9;S1526820919306639;31570268;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1526820919306639;;

It is important to differentiate neoplastic processes from follicular hyperplasia and regressive follicular changes. Better understanding of germinal center development and dissolution also provides diagnostic clues to the underlying pathologic process. It is also important in identifying the immune basis of different pathologic entities as well as in immunotherapy decision making and follow up. In this study, we characterize the immunoarchitecture of lymphoid follicles with a focus on germinal center in one representative case, each of commonly encountered benign and malignant lymph node disorders, with morphologic and immunohistochemical alterations of germinal centers. The cases include reactive follicular hyperplasia (FH), florid follicular hyperplasia (FFH), follicular lymphoma (FL), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), hyaline-vascular Castleman disease (HVCD), progressive transformation of germinal centers, nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL), lymphocyte-rich classic Hodgkin lymphoma (LR-CHL), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated follicular dissolution and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with proliferation centers (PC). A panel of antibodies were used namely CD3, CD20, CD10, BCL2, BCL6, CD21, CD23, CD35, FOXP1, GCET1, HGAL/GCET2, LMO2, MUM1, IgD, Ki67, PD1 and PD-L1. We found that these entities show distinct immunoarchitectural patterns of germinal center formation, development and regression, particularly, the distribution of mantle zone B-cells, follicular helper T cells (Tfh) and FDC meshworks, confirming the influence of antigenic stimulation and status of immune system in these changes. This also confirms the interrelationship of underlying immunologic mechanisms in these disease processes.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1092913419303508;2.8;2.8;2.5;S1092913419303508;31751845;151421;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1092913419303508;;

Patients and Methods Three dosages of intravenous oxaliplatin (50, 65 and 85 mg/m2) on days 1 and 15 and a fixed dose of FTD/TPI 35 mg/m2 twice daily (bid) on days 1–5 and 15–19 every 4 weeks were investigated in patients with refractory mCRC using a 3 + 3 design. Eligible patients had received prior oxaliplatin-based treatment that achieved a response or stable disease followed by confirmed disease progression at least 6 months before entering the study. Results Twelve patients were enrolled in the study. Three of six patients in the oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 cohort had dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) with treatment delays during the second cycle at 8 days due to grade  2 neutropenia or grade 2 AST/ALT increased. No DLTs were observed in the other cohorts. Grade  3 AEs were neutropenia (n = 3), thrombocytopenia (n = 1), anorexia (n = 1), and nausea (n = 1). There was no evidence of allergic reaction to oxaliplatin or severe peripheral sensory neuropathy. Conclusions A combination of FTD/TPI 35 mg/m2 bid on days 1–5 and 15–19 and oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15 every 4 weeks could be a suitable regimen for the recommended dose of FTD/TPI plus oxaliplatin in patients with refractory mCRC.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10637-019-00749-9;7.5;6.0;5.0;;30838483;;;;

Mutations that arise as a result of this are diverse across the various drugs, drug classes, drug regimens and subtypes. In Uganda, there is a paucity of information on how these mutations differ among the different drug regimens and the predominant HIV-1 subtypes. The purpose of this study was to determine mutation profile differences between first-line drug regimens: TDF/3TC/EFV and AZT/3TC/EFV and HIV-1 subtypes: A and D in Uganda. The study also investigated the potential usage of rilpivirine, doravirine and etravirine in patients who failed treatment on efavirenz. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 182 archived plasma samples obtained from patients who were experiencing virological failure between 2006 and 2017 at five Joint Clinical Research Center (JCRC) sites in Uganda. Sanger sequencing of the Reverse Transcriptase (RT) gene from codons 1-300 was done. Mutation scores were generated using the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database. A Chi-square test was used to determine the association between drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and drug regimens or HIV-1 subtypes. Results: The prevalence of DRMs was 84.6% among patients failing a first-line efavirenz (EFV)-based regimen. The most prevalent Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI) mutations were M184V/I (67.3%), K219/Q/E (22.6%) and K65R (21.1%). While K103N (50.8%) and G190A/S/E/G (29.1%) were the most prevalent Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNTRI) mutations. As expected, discriminatory DRMs such as K65R, L74I, and Y115F were noted in Tenofovir (TDF) containing regimens while the Thymidine Analogue Mutations (TAMs) L210W and T215 mutations were in Zidovudine (AZT)-based regimens. No significant difference (p = 0.336) was found for overall DRMs between HIV-1 subtypes A and D. Among the patients who had resistance to EFV, 37 (23.6%) were susceptible to newer NNRTIs such as Rilpivirine and Etravirine. Conclusion: Accumulation of DRMs between AZT/3TC/EFV and TDF/3TC/EFV is comparable but individual mutations that confer resistance to particular drugs should be considered at virological failure. Having either HIV-1 subtype A or D is not associated with the acquisition of DRMs, therefore HIV diversity should not determine the choice of treatment. Rilpivirine, etravirine and doravirine had minimal benefits for patients who failed on efavirenz.;https://aidsrestherapy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12981-020-0258-7;3.2;3.8;4.4;;32005262;2;;;

Various forced degradation studies of the two drugs had been conducted in order to identify significant degradation products and establish the degradation pathway induced by thermal, photolytic, acid/base hydrolytic and/or oxidative stress conditions. A reversed phase C18 UHPLC-PDA method has been developed for the analysis of the stressed samples. Seven significant degradation products of elbasvir and five significant degradation products of grazoprevir were found and investigated further by high resolution ESI-QTOF-MS with high accurate mass measurement (1.96 to 1.36 ppm). The chemical structures of each degradation product were proposed based on their relative MS/MS fragmentation spectra in comparison with the corresponding parent drugs and the chemical synthetic knowledge of process chemists. The validated stability-indicating UHPLC method can be used in routine analysis for the simultaneous determination of elbasvir and grazoprevir in pharmaceutical formulations. As more and more combination drugs will enter into the market, this study can also shed light on stability indicating method development for combined drugs at early development stage.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0731708519311860;5.5;5.1;5.5;S0731708519311860;31711865;112964;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0731708519311860;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Many patients, especially those with a high pill burden and multiple chronic illnesses, are less adherent to medication. In medication treatments utilizing polypills, this problem might be diminished since multiple drugs are fused into one formulation and, therefore, the therapy regimen is simplified. This systematic review summarized evidence to assess the effect of polypills on medication adherence. The following databases were searched for articles published between 1 January 2000, and 14 May 2019: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. Medication adherence was the only outcome assessed, regardless of the method of measuring it. Sixty-seven original peer-reviewed articles were selected. Adherence to polypill regimens was significantly higher in 56 articles (84%) compared to multiple pill regimens. This finding was also supported by the results of 13 out of 17 selected previously published systematic reviews and meta-analyses dealing with this topic. Adherence can be improved through the formulation of polypills, which is probably why the interest in researching them is growing. There are many polypills on the market, but the adherence studies so far focused mainly on a small range of medical conditions.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/12/2/190;5.2;2.9;2.9;;;190;;;

To reduce the computation burden, a complexity reduction scheme for depth map based on spatial correlation and the rate–distortion (RD) cost is proposed. Firstly, A maximum depth layer decision (MDLD) algorithm is proposed to predict the maximum depth layer (MDL) of each coding tree unit (CTU) accurately. Using the frequency distribution histogram theory in the statistics, the frequency distribution characteristics (FDC) of the RDcost J0 of the CTU level in depth layer 0 is investigated under different MDL. The initial threshold for different MDL is designed based on the FDC of the J0 under allowable false rate (FR). An exponential relationship between the threshold and QP is discovered. Secondly, A fast depth intra mode decision (FDIMD) algorithm is proposed to skip unnecessary prediction modes. Considering the spatial correlation, the FDC of the RDcost JORM of the optimal rough mode (ORM) in rough mode decision (RMD) is analyzed under different optimal prediction mode. Based on the FDC of the JORM, the mode-skipping threshold THst is designed to skip angular modes and depth modeling modes (DMMs). An exponential model is built to represent the relationship between the THst and QP. Finally, a fast wedgelet pattern decision method based on K-Means is developed to reduce the complexity of DMM1. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves an average reduction of 58.9% on intra coding time, with negligible degradation of coding performance. The proposed algorithm performs better in terms of complexity and performance than other approaches.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0923596519303182;4.6;5.2;5.6;S0923596519303182;;115668;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0923596519303182;;

Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdProblem: Pregnancy appears to favor maternal antibody production. In contrast, by damaging follicular helper T cells (TFH), HIV-1 infection compromises protective humoural immune response. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the frequency of different TFH-like cells in HIV-infected pregnant women (PW) before and after antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. Method of study: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, CD4+ T and B cells, were obtained from asymptomatic HIV-1–infected non-PW and PW just before and after ARV therapy. In some experiments, healthy HIV-1–negative PW were also tested. The frequency of different TFH-like cell subsets was determined by flow cytometry. The plasma titers of IgG anti-tetanus toxoid (TT), anti-HBsAg, and anti-gp41 were determined by ELISA. The in vitro production of total IgG, IL-21, and hormones (estrogen and progesterone) was quantified also by ELISA. Results: Our results demonstrate that antiretroviral (ARV) therapy was more efficient in elevating the percentage of circulating IL-21–secreting TFH cells in HIV-1–infected pregnant women (PW) than in non-pregnant patients (nPW). Moreover, in co-culture systems, CD4+ T cells from ART-treated PW were more efficient in assisting B cells to produce IgG production. The in vivo anti-HBsAg IgG titers after ARV therapy were also significantly higher in PW, and their levels were directly associated with both IL-21+TFH frequency and plasma concentration of estrogen. Conclusion: In summary, our results suggest that pregnancy favors the recovery of TFH-like cells after ARV therapy in HIV-1–infected women, which could help these mothers to protect their newborns from infectious diseases by transferring IgG across the placenta.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/aji.13204;5.3;4.7;5.7;;31674097;e13204;;;

In addition to the higher blocking voltages of WBG power modules, their volume has been targeted to be several times smaller than that of Si-based modules. This translates into higher electric stress within the module and, in turn, a higher risk for unacceptable partial discharge (PD) activities, leading to aging and degradation of both the ceramic substrate and the silicone gel. Due to the small dimensions of power module geometry, in the mm or m (for protrusions) range, and due to its extremely non-uniform electric field geometry, conventional high voltage testing electrode geometries cannot simulate real conditions. On the other hand, university-based laboratories often cannot provide testing samples under manufacturing/factory conditions and with high-quality materials. Thus, it is difficult to determine the efficacy of electric field and PD control methods. To address this issue, an electric field criterion based on precise dimensions of a power module and its PD measurement is introduced. Then, combined geometrical techniques and the application of nonlinear field-dependent conductivity (FDC) layers are proposed, for the first time, to address the high electric field issue in an envisaged 25 kV high-density WBG power module. Electric field modeling and simulations are carried in COMSOL Multiphysics where various electric field reduction methods proposed in this paper can be used as a guideline and reference to design the insulation system for next-generation WBG power modules, meeting both the one-minute insulation and PD tests based on IEC 61287-1.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8985647/;3.5;4.5;5.6;;;8985647;;;

These latter are expected to perform identically and fabricate similar product quality, which is not usually the case given the low margin of error allowed in the complex manufacturing environment. The difficulty lies in achieving desired yields and controlling the process variability to accurately match the performance of those parallel chambers at all production steps. In this paper, a methodology to detect the mismatching chambers and to identify the root causes integrating all the sources of production data, such as the sensor data and product measurements, is proposed. The Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis is employed to separate clusters with high probability density based on classified samples, while providing key variables that most separate the known classes. The supervised classification method, applied to the summarized Fault Detection and Classification data, is followed by the analysis of temporal variables.

Uncertain conditions in which a robot manipulator operates, as well as its nonlinearities, represent challenges for fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control (FDC) that are addressed through the proposed FDC technique. A machine-learning-based neural adaptive, high-order, variable structure observer for fault diagnosis (FD) and adaptive, modern, fuzzy, backstepping, variable structure control for use in a fault-tolerant control (FC) algorithm, are proposed in this paper. In the first stage, a variable structure observer is proposed as an FD technique for the robot manipulator. The chattering phenomenon associated with the variable structure observer(VSO) is solved using a high-order variable structure observer. Then, the dynamic behavior estimation performance in the high-order variable structure observer is improved by incorporating a neural network algorithm in the FD pipeline. This adaptive technique is also effective in improving the robustness of the fault signal estimation. Moreover, support vector machines (SVMs) that can derive adaptive threshold values are used to categorize faults. To design an effective fault-tolerant controller (FC), an adaptive modern fuzzy backstepping variable structure controller is used in this study. First, a new variable structure controller is designed. Next, to increase robustness and reduce high-frequency oscillations in uncertain conditions, a backstepping algorithm is used in parallel with the variable structure controller to design the backstepping variable structure controller. To design an effective hybrid controller, a fuzzy algorithm is integrated into the backstepping variable structure controller to create a fuzzy backstepping variable structure controller. Then, to improve the robustness and reliability of the FC, a neural adaptive. high-order. variable structure observer is applied to the fuzzy backstepping variable structure controller to design a modern fuzzy backstepping variable structure controller. An adaptive algorithm is used to fine-tune the variable structure coefficients and reduce the effect of faults on the robot manipulator.

However, whether LLV increases the risk of virologic failure (VF) is controversial because of the non-uniform definitions of LLV and VF. Methods: A long-term first line regimen ART cohort from 2002 to 2018 from Shenyang, northeast China, was retrospectively studied. All participants were followed up every 3 to 6 months to evaluate the treatment effect. The high-risk LLV subgroups leading to VF (with strict standards) were explored with Cox proportional hazards model and linear mixed-effect model. The association factors of high-risk LLV were further explored using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results: A total of 2155 HIV-1 infected participants were included; of these, 38.7% showed LLV. Both high level LLV (HLLV) and any other level LLV coupled with high level blip (HLB) showed higher risk of VF (hazards ratios, HRHLLV = 5.93, and HRHLB = 2.84, p < 0.05 respectively). Moreover, HR increased with prolonged duration of LLV. Independent factors associated with high-risk LLV included the zenith baseline viral load (VL) above 6 log copies/ml (aOR = 3.49, p = 0.002), nadir baseline CD4 + T cell counts below 200 cells/mm3 (aOR = 1.78, p = 0.011), Manchu (aOR = 2.03, p = 0.003), ART over 60 months (aOR = 1.81, p = 0.004), AZT + 3TC + NVP (aOR = 2.26, p < 0.001) or DDI-based regimen (aOR = 9.96, p = 0.002), and subtype B infection (aOR = 8.22, p = 0.001). Conclusions: In case of VF with strict standards, high-risk LLV leading to VF includes VL above 400 copies/ml, occurring at least once. Serious laboratory indicators or advanced stage of infection, long term ART and subtype B infection might also predict the occurrence of high-risk LLV.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-4837-y;4.5;4.3;4.1;;32066392;147;;;

In this study, the “Modello Idrologico Semi-Distribuito in continuo” (MISDc) was tested on 63 mountainous catchments in the western Po Valley (Italy) and the optimal model parameters were regionalized using different strategies. The model performance was evaluated through several indexes analysing hydrological regime, high-flow condition and flow–duration curve (FDC). In general, MISDc provides a good fit behaviour with a Kling-Gupta Efficiency index greater than 0.5 for 100% and 84% of cases for calibration and validation, respectively. Concerning the regionalization, spatial proximity approach is the most accurate solution obtaining satisfactory performance. Lastly, the predicted FDCs showed an excellent similarity with the observed ones. Results encourage to apply MISDc over the study area for flood forecasting and for assessing water resources availability thanks to the modest computational efforts and data requirements.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02626667.2019.1690656;3.7;4.2;4.7;;;;;;

Preclinical studies showed that combining taxanes with iTox results in synergistic antitumor activity. The objectives of this phase I/II study were to determine the MTD of LMB-100 when administered with nanoalbumin bound (nab)-paclitaxel to patients with previously treated advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma and to assess the objective response rate. Patients and Methods: Patients (n ¼ 20) received fixed-dose nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8) with LMB-100 (65 or 100 mg/kg on days 1, 3, and 5) in 21-day cycles for 1–3 cycles. Results: Fourteen patients were treated on the dose escalation and an additional six in the phase II expansion. MTD of 65 mg/kg was established for the combination. Dose-limiting toxicity resulting from capillary leak syndrome (CLS) was seen in two of five patients treated at 100 mg/kg and one of six evaluable phase I patients receiving the MTD. Severity of CLS was associated with increases in apoptotic circulating endothelial cells. LMB-100 exposure was unaffected by anti-LMB-100 antibody formation in five of 13 patients during cycle 2. Seven of 17 evaluable patients experienced >50% decrease in CA 19-9, including three with previous exposure to nab-paclitaxel. One patient developed an objective partial response. Patients with biomarker responses had higher tumor mesothelin expression. Conclusions: Although clinical activity was observed, the combination was not well tolerated and alternative drug combinations with LMB-100 will be pursued.;http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/lookup/doi/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-2586;15.6;16.0;16.1;;31792036;;;;

We aimed to explore the temporal association of S68G and K65R mutations and disclose the role of the former on susceptibility to nucleotide/nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and viral replication with the K65R double mutations among CRF01_AE-infected patients who failed treatment. Methods: The occurrence of S68G and K65R mutations was evaluated among HIV-1 of various subtypes in the global HIV Drug Resistance Database. The temporal association of S68G and K65R mutations was analyzed through next-generation sequencing in four CRF01_AE-infected patients who failed treatment with tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz. The impact of the S68G mutation on susceptibility to NRTI and replication fitness was analyzed using pseudovirus phenotypic resistance assays and growth competition assays, respectively. Results: The frequency of the S68G mutation increased by 1.4-9.7% in almost all HIV subtypes and circulating recombinant forms in treatment-experienced patients, except subtype F. The S68G mutation often occurred in conjunction with the K65R mutation among RTI-treated patients, with frequencies ranging 21.1-61.7% in various subtypes. Next-generation sequencing revealed that the S68G mutation occurred following the K65R mutation in three of the four CRF01_AE-infected patients. In these three patients, there was no significant change detected in the half maximal inhibitory concentration for zidovudine, tenofovir, or lamivudine between the K65R and K65R/S68G mutations, as demonstrated by the phenotypic resistance assays. Virus stocks of the K65R and K65R/S68G mutations were mixed with 4:6, 1:1, and 9:1 and cultured for 13 days, the K65R/S68G mutants outgrew those of the K65R mutants irrespective of the input ratio. Conclusions: S68G may be a natural polymorphism and compensatory mutation of K65R selected by NRTIs in the CRF01_AE strain of HIV-1. This mutation does not affect susceptibility to NRTI; however, it improves the replication fitness of K65R mutants. This study deciphers the role of the S68G mutation in the HIV reverse transcriptase of the CRF01_AE strain and provides new evidence for the interpretation of drug-resistant mutations in non-B subtypes of HIV-1.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-4836-z;4.5;4.3;4.1;;32046664;123;;;

Elevated viral load (VL) early after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation appears frequently in pregnant and postpartum women living with human immunodeficiency virus; however the relative contributions of pre-ART drug resistance mutations (DRMs) vs nonadherence in the etiology of elevated VL are unknown. Methods. Within a cohort of women initiating ART during pregnancy in Cape Town, South Africa, we compared women with elevated VL after initial suppression (cases, n = 80) incidence-density matched to women who maintained suppression over time (controls, n = 87). Groups were compared on pre-ART DRMs and detection of antiretrovirals in stored plasma. Results. The prevalence of pre-ART DRMs was 10% in cases and 5% in controls (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.53 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .4-5.9]); all mutations were to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. At the time of elevated VL, 19% of cases had antiretrovirals detected in plasma, compared with 87% of controls who were suppressed at a matched time point (aOR, 131.43 [95% CI, 32.8-527.4]). Based on these findings, we estimate that 10% of all elevated VL in the cohort may be attributable to pre-ART DRMs vs >90% attributable to ART nonadherence. Conclusions. DRMs account for a small proportion of all elevated VL among women occurring in the 12 months after ART initiation during pregnancy in this setting, with nonadherence appearing to drive most episodes of elevated VL. Alongside the drive for access to more robust antiretroviral agents in resource-limited settings, there is an ongoing need for effective strategies to support ART adherence in this patient population.";https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/70/3/501/5381972;14.0;13.8;12.5;;30877752;;;;

Current treatment plans require patients to take several drugs concomitantly leading to low therapy adherence. This study describes the development and characterisation of a stable parenteral co-formulation of a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin) and a therapeutic lipidated peptide, using hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin as an enabling excipient. Using NMR, calorimetry, computational modelling and spectroscopic methods, we show that besides increasing the solubility of dapagliflozin, cyclodextrin prevents self-association of the peptide through interaction with the lipid chain and amino acids prone to aggregation including aromatic groups and ionisable residues. While those interactions cause a dramatic secondary structure change, no impact on potency was seen in vitro. A subcutaneous administration of the co-formulation in rat showed that both drugs reach exposure levels previously shown to be efficacious in clinical mono-therapy studies. Interestingly, a faster absorption rate was observed for the peptide formulated within the cyclodextrin vehicle with respect to the buffer vehicle, which could trigger an earlier onset of action. The cyclodextrin based co-formulation is therefore a promising approach to develop a fixed dose combination of a therapeutic peptide and a small molecule drug for increased patient adherence and better blood glucose control.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378517320300016;6.6;7.2;7.6;S0378517320300016;31911116;119019;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0378517320300016;;

Therefore, investigating the factors associated with ART-related AEs may provide vital information for monitoring risks. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted among adult patients (aged 18 years or older) with HIV who received Tenofovir (TDF) + Lamivudine (3TC) + Efavirenz (EFV) as first-line ART regimens. All AEs during the first 12 months of therapy were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with AEs. Results: Four hundred seventy-four patients receiving TDF+ 3TC+ EFV ART regimens between March 2017 and October 2017 were included in the study analysis. Among them, 472 (99.6%) experienced at least one AE, 436 (92.0%) patients experienced at least one AE within 1 month of treatment, 33 (7.0%) between one and 3 months of treatment, and three (0.6%) patients after 3 months of treatment. The most commonly reported AE was nervous system (95.6%) related, followed by dyslipidemia (79.3%), and impaired liver function (48.1%). Patients with baseline body mass index (BMI) greater than 24 kg/m2 (adjusted OR 1.77, 95%CI 1.03-3.02), pre-existing multiple AEs (adjusted OR 2.72, 95%CI 1.59-4.64), and pre-existing severe AEs (adjusted OR 5.58, 95%CI 2.65-11.73) were at increased odds of developing a severe AE. Patients with baseline BMI greater than 24 kg/m2 (adjusted OR 2.72, 95%CI 1.25-5.89) were more likely to develop multiple AEs. Conclusion: The incidence of ART-related adverse events over a 12-month period in China was high. Baseline BMI greater than 24 kg/m2, pre-existing multiple AEs, and pre-existing severe AEs were shown to be independent risk factors for developing a severe AE.;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-4878-2;4.5;4.3;4.1;;32075584;158;;;

Periodic evaluation of drug usage pattern is needed to make suitable modifications in the prescription of drugs to obtain an optimum therapeutic benefit. Objectives: To evaluate the prescribing pattern of analgesics and to know the most routinely prescribed analgesic for post-operative pain management in the orthopaedics department. Methodology: A retrospective study was carried out for a period of six months from September 2018–February 2019. The post-operative usage pattern of analgesics was analyzed by collecting drug therapy details of patients from case sheets, including treatment charts, and analyzed by descriptive statistics. Results: Out of the total 400 cases selected for the study, 237 (59.25%) were males whereas 163 (40.75%) were females. 137 (34.25%) of the total study population belonged to the age group of 50-69 years. 93 (23.25%) Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF) and 90 (22.50%) Closed Reduction and Internal Fixation (CRIF) were the most common surgical procedures performed. Hypertension 95 (45.45%) was the most common co-morbidity reported. Drugs were given more as combination 295 (73.8%) therapy than Monotherapy 105 (26.2%). The most commonly prescribed agent among patients, who received single analgesic therapy, was Diclofenac. Among Fixed dose combination therapy, Paracetamol + Tramadol 173 (58.64%) was found to be the most prescribed analgesic. 465 (59.46%) of analgesics were given orally whereas 317 (40.53%) were administered parentally. Conclusion: Effective pain management can improve the quality of life of the patient as well as minimize the hospital stay. Drug utilization studies, when done periodically, can help in the modulation of analgesic therapy. The current study provides an insight to the health care providers on the importance of rational use of analgesics, which in turn helps in the delivery of good quality health care services.;None;0;0.0;0.2;;;;;;

As a consequence, healthcare professionals caring for PLHIV in high-income countries have increasingly focused on issues beyond those related to HIV itself, i.e. HIV-related neurological disease, or associated opportunistic infections, which include co-infections, and primarily age- and lifestyle-related comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, osteoporosis and frailty. This review considers drug side effects and comorbidities seen in PLHIV and evaluates the role of a recently licensed STR – bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF) – in mitigating some of those challenges. Factors that need to be evaluated for initial cART regimens include: pretreatment CD4 cell count; plasma HIV RNA; HIV drug resistance; hepatitis B co-infection; HLA-B*5701 status; drug-drug interactions; pregnancy and pregnancy potential; psychiatric and physical comorbidities such as renal or bone disease, as well as simplicity and adherence-friendliness, all of which need to be considered in all lines of therapy.

Since the potential role of KLKs in immunity has not been studied in detail at the protein level, we examined the expression pattern of 12 members of the KLK family in immune-related tissues. Design & Methods: Protein expression in tissue extracts was evaluated using immunoassays (ELISA). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on representative sections of tonsil and lymph nodes to determine the cellular localization of the KLK family members. Results: ELISA profiling of KLK3-KLK15 (except KLK12) revealed higher protein levels in the tonsil, compared to the lymph nodes and spleen. Relatively high protein levels in the tonsil were observed for KLK7, KLK9, KLK10 and KLK13. Expression of these KLKs was significantly lower in lymph nodes and spleen. IHC analysis in tonsil unveiled that KLK9 and KLK10 were differentially expressed in lymphoid cells. KLK9 was strongly expressed in the germinal center of lymphoid follicles where activated B-cells reside, whereas KLK10 was expressed in the follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) that are vital for maintaining the cycle of B cell maturation. Conclusion: Overall, our study revealed the possible implications of KLK expression and regulation in the immune cells of lymphoid tissues.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0009912019310112;4.7;4.6;4.5;S0009912019310112;31904348;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0009912019310112;;

In this study, we aimed to analyze the natural polymorphisms and acquired DRM profile in HIV-1 CRF01_AE-infected patients in a large first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) cohort in northeastern China. Methods: The natural polymorphisms of CRF01_AE were analyzed in 2034 patients from a long-term ART cohort in northeastern China. The polymorphisms in 105 treatment failure (TF) patients were compared with those in 1148 treatment success (TS) patients. The acquired DRM profile of 42 patients who experienced TF with tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz (TDF/3TC/EFV) treatment was analyzed by comparing the mutations at TF time point to those at baseline. The Stanford HIVdb algorithm was used to interpret the DRMs. Binomial distribution, McNemar test, Wilcoxon test and CorMut package were used to analyze the mutation rates and co-variation. Deep sequencing was used to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of co-variation. Results: Before ART, there were significantly more natural polymorphisms of 31 sites on reverse transcriptase (RT) in CRF01_AE than subtype B HIV-1 (|Z value|  3), including five known drug resistance-associated sites (238, 118, 179, 103, and 40). However, only the polymorphism at site 75 was associated with TF (|Z value|  3). The mutation rate at 14 sites increased significantly at TF time point compared to baseline, with the most common DRMs comprising G190S/C, K65R, K101E/N/Q, M184 V/I, and V179D/I/A/T/E, ranging from 66.7 to 45.2%. Moreover, two unknown mutations (V75 L and L228R) increased by 19.0 and 11.9% respectively, and they were under positive selection (Ka/Ks > 1, log odds ratio [LOD] > 2) and were associated with several other DRMs (cKa/Ks > 1, LOD > 2). Deep sequencing of longitudinal plasma samples showed that L228R occurred simultaneously or followed the appearance of Y181C. Conclusion: The high levels of natural polymorphisms in CRF01_AE had little impact on treatment outcomes. The findings regarding potential new CRF01_AE-specific minor DRMs indicate the need for more studies on the drug resistance phenotype of CRF01_AE.;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-4808-3;4.5;4.3;4.1;;32102660;178;;;

Limited data on the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of BDP/FF/GB fixed-dose combination in healthy subjects was available. Purposes: This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of BDP/FF/GB pMDI in healthy Chinese subjects. Methods: This is an open-label, parallel-group, randomized, single and multiple dose study. In the single dose group, subjects received single supra-therapeutic inhaled dose of BDP/FF/GB pMDI (BDP/FF/GB 400/24/50 µg). In the multiple dose group, subjects received therapeutic inhaled dose of BDP/FF/GB pMDI (BDP/FF/GB 200/12/25 µg), twice daily, for 7 consecutive days. Plasma BDP, B17MP, formoterol and GB were determined by a validated ultra performance liquid chromatography method with tandem mass spectrometric detection (UPLC/MS–MS). Heart rate (HR), QTcF, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were evaluated as the surrogate indicators of pharmacodynamic effects. Results: A total of 24 subjects were randomized and 22 (11 in each group) completed the study. The dose adjusted pharmacokinetic profiles of BDP, beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (B17MP, the most active metabolite of BDP), formoterol and GB were overall similar in therapeutic and supra- therapeutic dose group, showing dose proportional increase of the systemic exposure to BDP, B17MP, formoterol and GB. The pharmacodynamic variables were within the normal range and showed no significant difference between the two groups. All the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild and no severe TEAE was reported. Conclusions: Dose adjusted PK profiles were similar between therapeutic and supra-therapeutic dose for all compounds, nearly dose proportional systemic exposure to B17MP, formoterol and GB after BDP/FF/GB pMDI administration in healthy Chinese subjects. BDP/FF/GB pMDI was safe and well tolerated in healthy Chinese subjects. The PK profiles were comparable to previously published data from Western European healthy Caucasian subjects.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0928098719304713;5.7;5.4;6.6;S0928098719304713;31862312;105198;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0928098719304713;;

The recommended TB treatment is a combination of various antibiotics in the form of a fixed-dose combination tablet or kombipak; however, this increases the prevalence of drug-related problems. Therefore, this study aimed to identify drug-related problems of patients receiving TB therapy at the Tebet Subdistrict Health Center from July 2018 to December 2018. Methods: The study was designed as a cross-sectional study using the retrospective data retrieval method from prescriptions of patients with TB from July 2018 to December 2018. The classification system prepared by Cipolle, Strand, and Morley was used for the classification of drug-related problems; this system includes unnecessary drug therapy, required additional drug therapy, ineffective drug, dosage error, and drug interaction. Results: The percentage of unnecessary drug therapy, required additional drug therapy, ineffective drug, dosage error, and drug interaction was 2.85%, 6.89%, 1.54%, 12.46%, and 66.18%, respectively, with the occurrence of drug-related problems being the highest. Conclusion: The administration of anti-TB drugs can potentially cause drug-related problems. Therefore, the assessment needs to be optimized before the administration of medications to patients and medications should be prescribed and monitored regularly to achieve rational drug use.";https://innovareacademics.in/journals/index.php/ijap/article/view/37539;0.6;1.0;1.0;;;;;;

In the last decade many new and generic inhalative bronchodilators were launched at the German market, both monotherapies and fixed dose double bronchodilator (LABA/LAMA, beta adrenergic and antimuscarinic) or LABA and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and triple (LABA/LAMA/ICS) combinations. According to two surveys in 2015 among respiratory physicians we expected a high proportion of patients receiving duplicate prescriptions, e. g. a fixed dose new LABA/LAMA combination in addition to an existing ICS/LABA fixed dose combination. Methodology We searched the database of a large mail order pharmacy (DocMorris) to identify duplicate prescriptions of inhalative drugs for a patient by the same or by two or more different physicians during a 3 months period. Results Unexpectedly, we found as little as around 1% duplicate prescriptions for the same patient. Duplicate prescriptions involving combination products were found to be much more common than duplicate prescriptions of different mono-products. Irrespective the low percentage number of all prescriptions we saw in just one large mail order pharmacy several thousands of erroneous prescriptions. Conclusion At least in the setting of this mail order pharmacy duplicate (i. e. contraindicated and potentially dangerous) prescriptions are relatively rare. Prescribers and pharmacists should be aware of the issue of duplicates - especially when prescribing or filling prescriptions with combination products.;http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-1083-7961;1.3;1.3;1.6;;32143230;;;;

This translates into higher electric stress within the module and, in turn, a higher risk for unacceptable partial discharge (PD) activities, leading to aging and degradation of both the ceramic substrate and the silicone gel. Due to the small dimensions of power module geometry, in the mm-or m (for protrusions)-range, and due to its extremely non-uniform electric field geometry, conventional high-voltage testing electrode geometries cannot simulate real conditions. On the other hand, university-based laboratories often cannot provide manufacturing/factory conditions for testing samples and for high-quality materials. Thus, it is difficult to determine the efficacy of electric field control methods through experiments. In these situations, numerical electric field calculation is the only feasible way to evaluate different electrical insulation designs. To this end, the finite-element method (FEM) models of the electrical insulation system used in WBG power modules are developed in COMSOL Multiphysics. It is shown that the current geometrical techniques alone cannot address the high-electric field issue within high-density WBG modules. To address this issue, for the first time, nonlinear field-dependent conductivity (FDC) materials applied to high-electric stress regions in combination with a recently introduced geometrical technique known as the protruding substrate is proposed. In this regard, the nonlinear FDC layer is characterized and various designs to reduce the electric field are evaluated. Moreover, the effect of the operating frequency on the performance of the solution mentioned above will be studied.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8896871/;9.4;11.1;11.3;;;8896871;;;

This study aimed to evaluate time-dependent development of liver and renal injury in rats induced by subchronic use of 4FDC-AT regimen. Male Wistar rats (150-250 g) were divided into two groups of six. Group 1 was given placebo while group 2 was treated with 4FDC-AT (89 mg/200 g) for 28 days. Blood samples were withdrawn to measure serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine levels on day 0 (baseline), 7, 14 and 28 of treatment. Following the last treatment, rat liver and kidney were harvested for histological analysis. Elevation of ALT and creatinine levels were considered noteworthy if the levels are >50% from upper baseline. None of the placebo rats experienced a significant increase in ALT and creatinine levels from day 7 to 28. In contrast, ALT escalated in 50% of rats in 4FDC-AT group starting at day 14; however, the 4FDC-AT treatment only increased creatinine levels in 17% of rats after 28 days. Histopathological analysis of liver and kidney in the placebo group showed normal histology structures, while in 4FDC-AT treated rats showed profound hydropic and lipid degeneration of hepatocytes. In renal tubules, infiltration of inflammatory cells and vacuolization were only evident in one rat. It is concluded 4FDC-AT administration rapidly induces liver dysfunction and structural damage in rats while development of renal injury was slower and limited.";None;0.0;0.2;0.4;;;;;;

LPV is an antiviral (HIV) medicine and HIV protease inhibitor that was developed in a fixed-dose combination with RTV. According to existing RF legislation, results from bioequivalence studies with a reference drug must be submitted to register generics. Protocols and reports of bioequivalence studies of LPV/RTV film-coated tablet dosage forms that were submitted for review to the SCEEMP, MHRF, are analyzed. The number of administered tablets and duration of sample collection differed slightly in the study designs. The number of volunteers included in the study differed more substantially and was calculated based on the intra-subject coefficient of variation of LPV/RTV. A search of the internet for data on the variability of LPV/RTV found several results indicating that LPV/RTV was highly variable (30%). Recommendations for planning bioequivalence studies of LPV/RTV preparations are formulated based on the analysis.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11094-020-02130-0;0.7;0.6;0.7;;;;;;

Information on the incidence rate, epidemiological characteristics and transmission rate are essential to formulate effective preventive measures and management of OBE. From June-2016 to May-2018, OBE among HCW were captured systematically in EPINet (Exposure prevention information network) Register through Self reporting system. Data on number of in-patient days was collected. Incidence rate, epidemiological characteristics and transmission rate were analyzed and evaluated. Sixty seven OBE incidents were reported by HCWs accounting to an incidence rate of 0.2/1000 in-patient days. Of these, 94% were Needle stick injuries and 6% were Blood and body fluid exposures. OBE incidents occurred mainly in wards, emergency department and operation theatre with a rate of 38.8%, 35.8% and 14.9% respectively. Exposures were encountered mainly by Interns (32.8%), staff-nurses (22.4%), Post-graduate students (14.9%) and Nursing students (14.9%). Recapping of the needle was the activity which led to OBE in 37.3% and improper disposal of sharps in 22.38 % of the incidents.

Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) have several advantages over pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDIs), that are most frequently marketed world-wide, but often difficult to use. This literature search focus on DPI features, with respect to Easyhaler, that may affect their use and patients’ clinical benefit. Areas covered: DPIs are breath-actuated, easy to use, convenient to use, and more environmentally friendly. During inhalation, the formulation in a DPI is disaggregated by a turbulent airflow energy to generate particles with the greatest likelihood of deposition into the airways. The resistance among DPIs varies from low to high and those with high resistance are wrongly considered as difficult to use. Multidose reservoir-type DPIs have been developed to efficiently deliver a wide range of medications, including the fixed-dose combination of budesonide and formoterol. Easyhaler® shares a similar shape with pMDIs and, as other DPIs, its performance is unaffected by environmental and storage conditions. Due to Easyhaler internal design, dose emission is consistent irrespective of the inhalation flow used by each patient. Expert opinion: Easyhaler® may be considered one of the most convenient inhalers, for daily use, in patients with asthma or COPD.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17476348.2020.1721286;3.7;4.0;4.2;;32013627;;;;

Multiple randomised clinical trials (RCTs) on tuberculosis (TB) treatment have shown mixture of favourable, unfavourable and non-significant changes in outcomes with the use of fixed-dose combination (FDC) regimens. The aim of this study was to assess clinical effectiveness of FDC regimen as compared to the use of separate drugs in anti-TB treatment. Methods: Systematic literature search was carried out. RCTs with newly diagnosed smear-positive pulmonary TB cases were included. Defined outcomes were smear conversion, relapse, adverse reactions and patient compliance. Results: Initial search revealed 457 articles, out of which 7 were included for meta-analysis. Pooled risk ratio for smear conversion rate at the end of intensive phase was 1.01 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99–1.03; p = 0.40). Similarly, smear conversion rate at the end of treatment showed no significant difference (relative risk (RR) = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.99–1.02; p = 0.45). Pooled risk ratio for combined smear conversion rates was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.99–1.02). However, relapse rates showed marginally higher trend with FDC regimens (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 0.95–2.56; p = 0.49). Pooled analysis for adverse events showed no significant difference (RR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.86–1.11; p = 0.70). Analysis of patient compliance showed marginal increase among FDC group (RR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96–1.09; p = 0.47)). Conclusion: Fixed-dose combination (FDC) formulations are not inferior in treatment outcomes. It may also ease programme managers and patients by improving compliance. However, increase in relapse rates needs further evaluation through large multicentric studies before implementing policy change in the national programme.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S037712371830162X;1.2;1.4;1.2;S037712371830162X;;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S037712371830162X;;

Granulopoiesis can be divided into two phases: lineage determination and committed granulopoiesis. However, stage-specific impairment of granulopoiesis in PLWHA with neutropenia remains unclear. A total of 48 ART-naïve and 49 ART-experienced PLWHA from 2016 to 2018 were recruited and divided into non-, mild-, and moderate-to-severe-neutropenia groups according to their neutrophil counts. The bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood were collected and analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry for granulocyte subsets, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC), apoptosis, and emigration and retention of different subsets. Compared with healthy donors, the percentages of circulating segmented neutrophils were significantly decreased along with an increase of immature neutrophils in both groups. ART-naïve patients with moderate to severe neutropenia exhibited decreased proportion and accelerated apoptosis of relative mature segmented neutrophils. In contrast, ART-experienced patients with neutropenia displayed decreased proportion of granulocyte macrophage progenitors, indicating a defect at a stage of lineage determination. Meanwhile, ART-experienced patients with neutropenia also the expression of CXCR4 segmented neutrophils, suggesting an increased retention of segmented neutrophils inn the bone marrow. ART-naïve patients with neutropenia is caused by increased apoptosis of relatively differentiated neutrophils at committed granulopoiesis, whereas impaired lineage determination and enhanced retention of segmented neutrophils contribute to in ART-experienced patients.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/JLB.1A0120-414R;6.7;7.4;7.3;;32057138;;;;

Studies concerning this problem are scarce in Eastern Africa. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and predictors of OIs after initiation of HAART in Ethiopia. Methods A health facility based single centered cohort study using structured data extraction sheet was conducted. The study population was all HIV positive ART naive adolescents and adults who started HAART between January 2009 and May 2012. Simple random sampling technique was used to select 317 patients from the record. Multivariate binary logistic regression model was used to determine factors for the occurrence of OIs after initiation of HAART. Results The incidence of OIs after HAART was 7.5 cases/100person years. Tuberculosis, oral candidiasis, pneumonia and toxoplasmosis were the leading OIs after HAART. A bed ridden functional status at initiation of HAART, presence of OIs before HAART, non-adherence and low hemoglobin level were predictors for the occurrence of OIs after HAART. Conclusion The incidence of OIs after HAART was higher than in previous studies. Patients with the identified risk factors need strict follow up to reduce the morbidity and mortality attributed to OIs. Earlier initiation of HAART before advanced immune suppression, better management of TB and extended baseline assessment could help to reduce opportunistic infections and mortality after the initiation of HAART in Ethiopian patients.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229757;5.7;5.4;5.2;;32310961;e0229757;;;

Objective: To assess the relationship between patterns of use of therapy and asthma exacerbations (AEx). Methods: Patients with asthma (6-40 years) were enrolled in France and the United Kingdom. Prescribing data, computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATIs), and text messages assessed medication use and AEx over a maximum period of 24 months. Generalized linear mixed models provided AEx risks associated with therapy. Results: Among the 908 patients (median age: 20.0 years, 46.6% women, 24.5% children) answering a total of 4248 CATIs over 486 (±235) days, regular (ie, daily) use was more frequent for single LABAs and fixed dose combinations (FDCs) than for single ICS (75.6%, 70.1%, and 65.4% of investigated periods of use, respectively). Regular (ie, daily or almost daily) SABA use was observed for 21.1% of periods of use. Altogether, 265 patients (29.2%) experienced 1 or more AEx. The ORs for AEx risk related to regular vs no use of FDCs, single ICS, and single LABAs were 0.98 (95% CI = [0.73-1.33]), 0.90 (95% CI = [0.61-1.33]), and 1.29 (95% CI = [0.76-2.17]), respectively, after adjustment for cotherapy, sociodemographic, and disease characteristics. The OR was 2.09 (95% CI = [1.36-3.21]) in regular SABA users. Conclusion: Inhaled corticosteroids and FDCs were often used intermittently, whereas SABAs and LABAs could be used regularly, and exacerbations were frequent. Compared with non-users, the risk of exacerbation increased moderately under regular use of single LABAs, whereas it doubled, significantly, in regular SABA users, likely in relationship with poor overall asthma control.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1081120619314905;3.8;3.5;3.9;S1081120619314905;31862434;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1081120619314905;;

In the proposed method, design problem of an IIR filter is constructed as the minimization of phase error between the desired and designed phase response of an allpass filter APF such that the designed lowpass filter LPF or highpass filter HPF yields less passband ep , and stopband errors es with optimal stopband attenuation As . In order to have accurate passband pb response, FDCs are imposed on appropriate reference frequency, where the optimality of these FDCs are ensured by using a new greedy based sorting mechanism. The simulated results reflect the efficiency of the proposed method in term of improved passband response along with better transition width. However, small reduction in As is observed within the allowable limit, when compared to non-fractional design approach, but the designed filter remains immune to wordlength WL effect.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9016402/;3.9;6.1;8.3;;;9016402;;;

Published by Innovare Academic Sciences Pvt Ltd.Objective: Lynestrenol, a progestin hormone derivative, can suppress the productions of endogenous estrogen and progesterone hormones (ovaries) to prevent ovulation. In this study, lynestrenol was included in various transfersomal gel preparations for its transdermal delivery into fat (F)-and non-fat (NF)-containing skin tissues. Methods: Lynestrenol transfersome vesicles were prepared by encapsulating the drug in varied concentrations of phosphatidylcholine and Tween 80 using lipid film hydration method. Transfersomes were produced in the form of gel preparations at a dose of 0.15 mg/week and evaluated for their particle size, percentage of entrapment efficiency, and particle polydispersity. We performed in vitro evaluations of the formulation variants F0 (lynestrenol gel control) and F1 and F2 (lynestrenol transfersome gels) with variations in their phosphatidylcholine and Tween 80 content. We then performed an in vitro evaluation using the Franz diffusion cell (FDC) method for 12 h using all three formulations on F and NF-containing rat skin. Results: The FDC results demonstrated that lynestrenol was deposited into fat tissue and increased concentrations of Tween 80 (edge activator) increased lynestrenol delivery into this tissue. In addition, the percentages of drug penetration from NF rat skin treated with F0, F1, and F2 gels were 19.56%, 20.13%, and 20.56%, respectively, and those from F rat skin were 17.16%, 17.38%, and 17.50%, respectively. Conclusion: In vitro evaluation using the FDC method indicates that transdermal drug delivery through to fat tissues using transfersomes is a promising method for lynestrenol delivery.;https://innovareacademics.in/journals/index.php/ijap/article/view/37591;0.6;1.0;1.0;;;;;;

Approximately, 60% of new cases occur in HIV-serodiscordant couples mainly because 30% of married HIV positives have HIV-negative spouse. With the advent of newer and better antiretroviral treatment (ART) to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV, there is increase in the number of serodiscordant couple who are considering natural conception. Pregnancy is a marker of unprotected intercourse rather than the motivation for engaging in unprotected intercourse and indicates an unmet need of counseling for exposure prophylaxis and contraceptive practice in future. Once pregnancy has been diagnosed, there is further need to ensure prevention of parent-to-child transmission of HIV. Strict adherence to protocols and guidelines is mandatory to ensure successful outcome.;https://www.jsafog.com/doi/10.5005/jp-journals-10006-1762;0.0;0.0;0.0;;;;;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The implementation of Family Doctor Concept (FDC) to restructure the primary healthcare systems in Malaysia were expected to enhance patient’s satisfaction on doctor-patient interaction and subsequently improved glycaemic control among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients. Thus, this study aims to determine the difference in doctor-patient interaction satisfaction between T2DM patients attended FDC-implemented clinic vs non-FDC clinics, and to determine the association between FDC-implemented clinic and doctor-patient interaction satisfaction towards glycaemic control. A cross-sectional study was conducted throughout 10 districts in Kelantan from February until May 2019 using interview-guided Skala Kepuasan Interaksi Perubatan-11 (SKIP-11) and proforma checklist. Data were analyzed using SPSS ver.24. Chi-square statistic used to determine the difference in doctor-patient interaction satisfaction between both clinics type. Multiple logistic regression used to examine the association between FDC-implemented clinic and doctor-patient interaction satisfaction towards glycaemic control. Twenty primary health clinics involved, and 772 T2DM patients recruited. FDC clinics attendees has higher proportion of satisfaction (40.1%) compared to non-FDC attendees (33.7%) (p = 0.070). Multiple logistic regression confirmed the association of FDC-implemented health clinics (Adj. OR 1.63, p = 0.021), and doctor-patients interaction satisfaction (Adj. OR 1.77, p = 0.005) towards glycaemic control. Hence, strengthening of FDC in primary healthcare and improve the doctor-patient interaction satisfaction were essential to escalate good glycaemic control.;https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/5/1765;3.2;3.1;3.0;;32182755;1765;;;

These advantages may however be mitigated by increased relapse rates and delays in achievement of full donor chimerism (FDC). Pre-emptive donor lymphocyte infusions (pDLI) facilitate the conversion of mixed (MDC) to FDC. However, there is a lack of published data on the risk/benefit analysis of this intervention. We performed a retrospective analysis of 119 patients who received 276 pDLI doses for falling CD3 chimerism, CD3 < 50% or mixed XX/XY karyotype. 71/119(60%) Patients achieved FDC, with only one reverting to MDC. Cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse at 5 years was significantly lower in the FDC group (16.0 vs 41.4%, p < 0.001). Those patients who achieved FDC had improved EFS (p < 0.001) and OS (p < 0.001). Interestingly, patients with FDC who developed DLI-induced graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) showed a similar outcome to those with MDC. The majority of patients who receive pDLI convert to FDC and retain that status. Achievement of FDC after pDLI impacts on survival, and those patients who achieve FDC without GvHD, experience maximum clinical benefit. Strategies to minimise DLI-induced GvHD should be considered to maximise the therapeutic potential of this intervention.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41409-019-0695-x;6.6;6.9;6.3;;31558789;;;;

Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 licenseBackground: The integrase inhibitor dolutegravir is being considered in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa instead of efavirenz for people initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) because of superior tolerability and a lower risk of resistance emergence. WHO requested updated modelling results for its 2019 Antiretroviral Guidelines update, which was restricted to the choice of dolutegravir or efavirenz in new ART initiators. In response to this request, we modelled the risks and benefits of alternative policies for initial first-line ART regimens. Methods: We updated an existing individual-based model of HIV transmission and progression in adults to consider information on the risk of neural tube defects in women taking dolutegravir at time of conception, as well as the effects of dolutegravir on weight gain. The model accounted for drug resistance in determining viral suppression, with consequences for clinical outcomes and mother-to-child transmission. We sampled distributions of parameters to create various epidemic setting scenarios, which reflected the diversity of epidemic and programmatic situations in sub-Saharan Africa. For each setting scenario, we considered the situation in 2018 and compared ART initiation policies of an efavirenz-based regimen in women intending pregnancy, and a dolutegravir-based regimen in others, and a dolutegravir-based regimen, including in women intending pregnancy. We considered predicted outcomes over a 20-year period from 2019 to 2039, used a 3% discount rate, and a cost-effectiveness threshold of US$500 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. Findings: Considering updated information on risks and benefits, a policy of ART initiation with a dolutegravir-based regimen rather than an efavirenz-based regimen, including in women intending pregnancy, is predicted to bring population health benefits (10 990 DALYs averted per year) and to be cost-saving (by $2·9 million per year), leading to a reduction in the overall population burden of disease of 16 735 net DALYs per year for a country with an adult population size of 10 million. The policy involving ART initiation with a dolutegravir-based regimen in women intending pregnancy was cost-effective in 87% of our setting scenarios and this finding was robust in various sensitivity analyses, including around the potential negative effects of weight gain. Interpretation: In the context of a range of modelled setting scenarios in sub-Saharan Africa, we found that a policy of ART initiation with a dolutegravir-based regimen, including in women intending pregnancy, was predicted to bring population health benefits and be cost-effective, supporting WHO's strong recommendation for dolutegravir as a preferred drug for ART initiators.

It is mainly attributed to the inadequate understanding of multiscale damage mechanisms, unique engineering, and geological conditions of these reservoirs. To fill this gap, an engineered formation-damage-control (FDC) drill-in-fluid technology is developed for a representative deep-fractured reservoir in China. Petrology, petrophysics, and well-history data are summarized to analyze the reservoir engineering and geological properties and the potential formation-damage factors. Drill-in-fluid-induced damage is experimentally evaluated on both matrix and fracture core samples at 130°C. Additionally, drill-in-fluid invasion depth is quantitatively evaluated using a mathematical model. The multiscale mechanisms of drill-in-fluid-induced formation damage are revealed to design the FDC drill-in-fluid technology. The optimized drill-in fluid is engineered by a specific assembly of acid-soluble-fiber bridging particles, filling particles, and an oil-soluble temporary-plugging agent. The effectiveness of the engineered FDC drill-in fluid is validated by laboratory experiment comprising basic-parameter tests and evaluation of FDC performance. Successful field application of the engineered FDC drill-in fluid in Tarim Basin is also discussed.;http://www.onepetro.org/doi/10.2118/198915-PA;2.6;3.5;3.6;;;;;;

Methods: Data from patients who were not maintenance-treated at screening (NMT) (n = 1943) and patients who were maintenance-treated at screening (MT) patients (n = 3040) receiving GFF, FF, GP, or placebo were pooled from the Phase III PINNACLE studies (NCT01854645, NCT01854658, NCT02343458) for post-hoc analysis. MT patients had received long-acting bronchodilators and/or inhaled corticosteroids in the 30 days prior to screening, and/or prior to randomization. NMT patients had received short-acting bronchodilators or no treatment. Outcomes included forced expiratory volume over 1 s (FEV1), clinically important deterioration (CID), rescue medication use, and safety. Results: GFF provided significant lung function improvements at Week 24 versus placebo, GP, and FF for NMT patients, with pre-dose trough FEV1 treatment differences of 152 (117-188) mL, 73 (45-100) mL, and 56 (29-84) mL, respectively (least squares mean change from baseline versus comparators [95% CI]; all P < 0.0001). GFF reduced the risk of CID by 17-43% in NMT (P  0.0157) and 18-52% (P  0.0012) in MT patients compared with monotherapy and placebo, and reduced rescue medication use by 1.5 puffs/day over 24 weeks for both cohorts. Safety profiles for all cohorts were consistent with each other and the parent studies. Conclusions: NMT patients achieved better lung function with GFF versus monotherapy and placebo, without increased safety risk. Dual bronchodilator therapy may offer better outcomes than monotherapy for COPD patients when administered as first-line treatment.";https://respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12931-020-1332-3;6.3;5.3;5.3;;32164675;69;;;

One of these immunomodulation mechanisms is the impairment of dendritic cells (DC) maturation and, therefore, suppression of antigenic presentation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pathological changes as well as the characterization of two antigen presenting cells, DC (CD1b, CD83 and MHC-II positive) and follicular dendritic cells (FDC) (CNA.42, S100 and CD83 positive) by immunohistochemistry in the hepatic lymph nodes (HLN) and livers of sheep during the early stages of infection with F. hepatica [9 and 18 days post-infection (dpi)], compared with an uninfected group (UC) as a control. The results revealed a marked hyperplasia of HLN germinal centres at 9 and, in particular, 18 dpi, with respect to the UC group, with coincidental increased expression of CNA.42 in FDC of lymphoid follicles and CD1b in the DC of paracortical areas at 18 dpi. However, the expression of MHC-II and CD83 decreased at 9 and, particularly, at 18 dpi in HLN compared with that in the UC group. Since both markers are related to active presentation of antigens by DC and FDC, the results of the present study suggest that, despite the marked hyperplasia of HLN and increase in DC and FDC numbers during early stages of infection, the DC and FDC antigenic presentation capacity, as suggested by the expression of the markers MHC-II and CD83, is suppressed by the parasite. This suppression was not observed in the liver, probably because of the low number of DC. This is the first study of the immunophenotype of DCs and FDC in sheep infected with F. hepatica.;https://veterinaryresearch.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13567-020-00757-1;0;0;5.4;;32131896;33;;;

A large retrospective study reports that adding a second long-acting bronchodilator in patients with COPD significantly increases the risk of heart failure. Nevertheless, retrospective studies are characterized by limitations including misdiagnosis and inaccuracy of recordkeeping. This study aimed to ascertain whether tiotropium/olodaterol (T/O) 5/5 g fixed-dose combination (FDC) may modulate the risk of main cardiovascular outcomes in COPD patients enrolled in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A meta-analysis (CRD42017070100) was performed by selecting RCTs reporting raw data from the ClinicalTrials.gov database concerning the impact of T/O 5/5 µg FDC vs. monocomponents on the occurrence of specific cardiovascular serious adverse events: arrhythmia, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Data were reported as relative risk and 95% Confidence Interval, and the risk of publication bias assessed via Egger’s test. Eighty six full text articles were identified, and 10 RCTs published in 7 studies between 2015 and 2018 were included into the analysis. Data obtained from 12,690 COPD patients (44.47% T/O FDC, 55.53% monocomponents) were extracted. T/O 5/5 g FDCs did not significantly modulate (p-value > 0.05) the risk of arrhythmia (1.02, 0.55 - 1.92), heart failure (0.88, 0.41 - 1.92), myocardial infarction (1.15, 0.70 - 1.87), and stroke (0.98, 0.44 - 2.16) vs. monocomponents. No significant publication bias affected the effect estimates of this meta-analysis. The results of this quantitative synthesis indicate that dual bronchodilation with T/O 5/5 g FDC is characterized by an acceptable cardiovascular safety profile in COPD patients.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15412555.2020.1749252;4.4;4.6;4.8;;32252547;;;;

Fixed-dose combinations of antiretrovirals largely reduce pill burden. Areas covered: The authors first provide an overview of the use of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) based therapy in HIV care. They then summarize the properties of each drug in the fixed-dose combination of tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine/rilpivirine/(TAF/FTC/RPV). The efficacy and safety of each component and the combination as a whole are reviewed: FTC is non-inferior to lamivudine (3TC) at assessed dosages; TAF was non-inferior to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF); the viral efficacy of RPV is non-inferior with EFV at the assessed dosage; TAF/FTC/RPV is non-inferior in efficacy but shows less of a decline in bone mineral density and renal function compared to TDF/FTC/RPV. Finally, adverse effects and drug–drug interaction data with FTC/RPV/TAF are discussed. Expert opinion: TAF/FTC/RPV can be used as an initial regimen for people living with HIV whose HIV RNA <100,000 copies/ml and CD4 cell count > 200 cells/mm3 when INSTI-based regimens are not a treatment option. Future antiretroviral therapy development may focus on dual therapy-based regimens containing RPV, particularly as long-acting formulations.";https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14656566.2020.1713096;5.7;5.6;4.9;;31957507;;;;

The aim of this study was to estimate the rate of potential DDIs/contraindications of real-world prescribed non-ART comedication with first-line recommended ART in people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Germany. Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional cohort design was used to collect non-ART comedication prescription data from a representative sample of a German health insurance claims database. PLHIV who were prescribed ART during 2016 were included in the analysis. Patients were stratified by sex, age, comorbidities, and time on ART. Prescribed comedications were used to estimate potential DDIs/contraindications for each recommended first-line ART per patient based on criteria from www.hiv-druginteractions.org. Results: Records from 2680 PLHIV were analyzed. Prescriptions for non-ART comedications were common (mean of seven per patient in the overall population, 10.2 in PLHIV aged 50 years and older). Antiretroviral regimens with the lowest proportion of patients with at least 1 potential DDI/contraindication were unboosted integrase inhibitor, non-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate–based regimens that included raltegravir + emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (13%), dolutegravir + lamivudine (14%), dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (14%), dolutegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (15%), and bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (19%). Boosted regimens and efavirenz-based regimens presented the highest potential for DDIs/contraindications. Conclusions: Comedication with potential DDIs/contraindications with ART is frequently prescribed among PLHIV in Germany. Potential risks for DDIs/contraindications vary by ART, with the lowest potential seen in unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor-based regimens, including raltegravir + emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate, followed by three dolutegravir-based regimens.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pds.4928;4.1;4.1;4.5;;31950545;;;;

Objectives: The main objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of acquired drug resistance (ADR) the epidemic characteristics of HIV-1-resistant strains among ART-failed HIV patients in Hunan Province, China. Methods: ART-experienced and virus suppression failure subjects in Hunan between 2012 and 2017 were evaluated by genotyping analysis and mutations were scored using the HIVdb.stanford.edu algorithm to infer drug susceptibility. Results: The prevalence of HIV-1 ADR were 2.76, 2.30, 2.98, 2.62, 2.23and 2.17%, respectively, from 2012 to 2017. Overall 2295 sequences were completed from 2932 ART-failure patients, and 914 of these sequences were found to have drug resistance mutation. The most common subtype was AE (64.14%), followed by BC (17.91%) and B (11.50%). Among those 914 patients with drug resistance mutations,93.11% had NNRTI-associated drug resistance mutations, 74.40% had NRTI drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and 6.89% had PI DRMs. Dual-class mutations were observed in 591 (64.66%) cases, and triple-class mutations were observed in 43 (4.70%) cases. M184V (62.04%), K103N (41.90%) and I54L (3.83%) were the most common observed mutations, respectively, in NRTI-, NNRTI-A nd PI-associated drug resistance. 93.76% subjects who had DRMs received the ART first-line regimens. CD4 count, symptoms in the past 3 months, and ART adherence were found to be associated with HIV-1 DR. Conclusions: This study showed that although the prevalence of HIV-acquired resistance in Hunan Province is at a low-level, the long-term and continuous surveillance of HIV ADR in antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) patients is necessary.;https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12985-020-01311-3;4.0;4.2;4.5;;32183889;38;;;

Methods: This prespecified analysis pooled efficacy data through the first 48 weeks of DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD from the DOR groups (DOR/lamivudine [3TC]/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF] or DOR [100 mg daily] with emtricitabine [FTC]/TDF or abacavir [ABC]/3TC [n = 747]) compared with DRV+r (800/100 mg daily) with FTC/TDF or ABC/3TC (n = 383) or EFV/FTC/TDF (600/200/300 mg daily; n = 364). Efficacy assessments included the proportion of participants with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA <50 copies/mL and change in CD4+ T-cell count. Results: At week 48, DOR demonstrated noninferior efficacy to DRV+r and EFV, with 84.1% of DOR-treated participants achieving HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL compared with 79.9% of the DRV+r and 80.8% of the EFV groups. Results were similar across demographic/prognostic subpopulations, including baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA, gender, race, and HIV-1 subtype. Mean increases from baseline in CD4+ T-cell count through 48 weeks were 195.5 cells/mm3 for DOR, 185.6 cells/mm3 for DRV+r, and 188.4 cells/mm3 for EFV/FTC/TDF. Conclusions: DOR, as a single entity (in combination with other antiretroviral agents) and as a fixed-dose combination (DOR/3TC/TDF), demonstrated noninferior efficacy to DRV+r and EFV as assessed by the proportion of HIV-1-infected, treatment-naive adults with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL.

In this work, the feasibility of coaxial electrospraying (CES) was investigated to manufacture in one single step, a powder of individually coated particles containing atenolol (ATE), lovastatin (LOV) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). To improve the dissolution rate of the poorly water soluble LOV, an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) of LOV with Soluplus® (SOL) was formulated and Eudragit S100®, an enteric copolymer that only dissolves above pH 7, was applied as coating to avoid LOV hydrolysis in acidic medium. Furthermore, ATE was added to the inner ASD compartment and the acidic ASA was embedded in the coating layer. With regard to the uncoated ASD particles, which were prepared with single nozzle electrospraying, the rate and extent of the LOV dissolution was increased, even to an extent of 100% for the 1/1/6 (ATE/LOV/SOL) ratio. Hence, this ratio was selected and coated particles with proper release of the three APIs could be successfully produced via CES. However, a peculiar behaviour of the coating performance was observed. Regarding LOV, the enteric layer of the particles performed as expected in acidic medium and supersaturation was obtained after the switch to a neutral pH, but in contrast, over 50% of ATE was released after 90 min in acidic medium. Nonetheless, hardly any ATE was released under acidic circumstances from ATE tablets that were, as a benchmark, manually dip-coated with Eudragit S100®. Two different model APIs, namely paracetamol (well soluble) and fenofibrate (poorly soluble) were tested as well, revealing similar discrepancy in the coating performance. The coating layer formed during CES is most likely less dense as compared to the layer produced with tablet coating and consequently, more permeable for highly soluble APIs, but not for the poorly soluble compounds.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378517319309949;6.6;7.2;7.6;S0378517319309949;31837403;118949;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0378517319309949;;

Methods: DOR (100 mg) arms from these trials were compared with darunavir plus ritonavir (DRV+r) in DRIVE-FORWARD and efavirenz (EFV) in P007 and DRIVE-AHEAD. Background therapies were emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) in P007; abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) or FTC/TDF in DRIVE-FORWARD; and 3TC/TDF for DOR and FTC/TDF for EFV in DRIVE-AHEAD. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants discontinuing due to adverse events (AEs) through Week 48. Results: Discontinuation rates due to AEs were similar for participants on DOR and DRV+r (2.5% vs 3.1%, respectively) and lower for those on DOR than for those on EFV (2.5% vs 6.6%, respectively). Rates of drug-related AEs for DOR, DRV+r, and EFV were 30.9%, 32.1%, and 61.4%, respectively. In an analysis of DOR versus EFV, the treatment difference for discontinuations due to AEs was -3.4%, favoring DOR (95% confidence interval -6.2 to -0.8; P =. 012). Fewer participants experienced neuropsychiatric AEs on DOR than on EFV (25.0% vs 55.9%, respectively), and fewer experienced diarrhea on DOR than on DRV+r (12.4% vs 22.5%, respectively). Changes from baseline in most lipid parameters also favored DOR. Conclusions: At Week 48, DOR at 100 mg had a favorable safety profile compared with EFV or DRV+r and a favorable tolerability profile compared with EFV.

Maytenus royleanus (Celastraceae) is a medicinal plant, possesses antioxidant and anticancer activities. The hepatoprotective effect of the methanol extract of Maytenus royleanus leaves (MEM) against Myrin®-p Forte induced hepatotoxicity in mice was investigated. Methods: Mice were randomly parted into six groups (n = 6). Fixed-dose combination of Myrin®-p Forte (13.5 mg/kg Rifampicin, 6.75 mg/kg Isoniazid, 36.0 mg/kg Pyrazinamide and 24.8 mg/kg Ethambutol; RIPE] was administered for 15 days to induce liver injury. In treatment groups MEM (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg doses) and Vitamin B6 (180mg/kg) were administered prior to RIPE. Control group received 2% DMSO. Serum liver function tests, DNA damage, tissue antioxidant enzymes and histopathological alterations were studied. HPLC analysis was performed to determine the chemical composition using standard compounds. Results: The quercitin, gallic acid, luteolin, viteixin, apigenin, kaempherol, hyperoside and myricetin contents of all samples were determined by reverse-phase HPLC. Quercetin (0.217 mg/g dry weight) and luteolin (0.141 mg/g dry weight) were the major flavonoids identified in MEM. Myrin®-p Forte markedly (p < 0.05) deteriorated lipid profile and upregulated the concentration of LDH, AST, ALP, ALT and -GT in serum along with DNA fragmentation (37.13 ± 0.47%) and histopathological injuries in hepatic tissues of mice compared with the control group. Myrin®-p Forte increased (p < 0.001) lipid peroxidation and H2O2 while decreased (p < 0.001) the activity level of CAT, SOD, POD, GPx, GST, GSR, -GT and GSH. Co-administration of MEM (200 mg/kg; 400 mg/kg) or the vitamin B6 (180 mg/kg) to Myrin®-p Forte administered mice significantly ameliorated LDL, cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride content. Furthermore, MEM dose dependently corrected serum liver function tests, decrease % DNA fragmentation (17.82 ± 0.35 and 7.21 ± 0.32 respectively), DNA damage. MEM treated protect RIPE induced oxidative damage by enhancing antioxidants to oxidants balance. Histological examination comprehends biochemical findings.

Methods: All ALHIV (10-19 years), on ART for 6 months, presenting to care at a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) clinic in Myanmar from January-April 2016 were eligible for the quantitative study component (clinical history, medical examination, laboratory investigation). A subset of these respondents were invited to participate in qualitative interviews. Interviews and focus groups were also conducted with other key informants (care givers, clinicians). Results: Of 177 ALHIV, 56% (100) were aged 9-13 years and 77 (44%) were 14-19. 49% (86) had been orphaned by one parent, and 19% (33) by both. 59% (104) were severely underweight (BMI < 16). 47% presented with advanced HIV (WHO stage III/IV). 93% were virally supressed (< 250 copies/mL). 38 (21%) of ALHIV were on a second-line ART after first-line virological failure. Qualitative interviewing highlighted factors limiting adherence and the central role that HIV counsellors play for both ALHIV patients and caregivers. Conclusions: Our study shows good clinical, immunological, and virological outcomes for a cohort of Myanmar adolescents living with HIV, despite a majority being severely underweight, presenting with Stage III or IV illness, and the prevalence of comorbid infections (TB). Many treatment and adherence challenges were articulated in qualitative interviewing but emphasized the importance of actively engaging adolescents in their treatment.

We aimed to determine if responses to standardized combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) were similar between groups despite strain divergence. Methods: We performed an open nonrandomized study comparing the immunological, virological, and clinical responses to cART based on 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus 1 ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor, in naive and paired HIV-1/O vs HIV-1/M infected (+) patients (ratio 1:2), matched on several criteria. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with undetectable plasma viral load (pVL, threshold 60 copies/mL) at week (W) 48. Secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with undetectable pVL at W24 and W96 and CD4 evolution between baseline and W24, W48, and W96. Results: Forty-seven HIV-1/O+ and 94 HIV-1/M+ patients were included. Mean pVL at baseline was significantly lower by 1 log for HIV-1/O+ vs HIV-1/M+ patients. At W48, no significant difference was observed between populations with undetectable pVL and differences at W24 and W96 were not significant. A difference in CD4 gain was observed in favor of HIV-1/M at W48 and W96, but this was not significant when adjusted on both matched criteria and pVL at baseline. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate similar immunovirological and clinical response between HIV-1/O+ and HIV-1/M+ patients. They also reveal significantly lower baseline replication for HIV-1/O variants, suggesting specific virological properties and physiopathology that now need to be addressed.

However, the clinical potential of cell-associated (CA) HIV-1 molecular markers is much less understood. Here, we measured CA HIV-1 RNA and DNA in HIV-infected individuals treated with temporary ART initiated during primary HIV-1 infection. We demonstrate substantial predictive value of CA RNA for (a) the virological and immunological response to early ART, (b) the magnitude and time to viral rebound after discontinuation of early ART, and (c) disease progression in the absence of treatment. Remarkably, when adjusted for CA RNA, plasma VL no longer appeared as an independent predictor of any clinical endpoint in this cohort. The potential of CA RNA as an HIV-1 clinical marker, in particular as a predictive biomarker of virological control after stopping ART, should be explored in the context of HIV-1 curative interventions.;https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/134196;0;2.6;5.8;;32097124;e134196;;;

Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.The removal of 5-methyl-deoxycytidine (mdC) from promoter elements is associated with reactivation of the silenced corresponding genes. It takes place through an active demethylation process involving the oxidation of mdC to 5-hydroxymethyl-deoxycytidine (hmdC) and further on to 5-formyl-deoxycytidine (fdC) and 5-carboxy-deoxycytidine (cadC) with the help of -ketoglutarate-dependent Tet oxygenases. The next step can occur through the action of a glycosylase (TDG), which cleaves fdC out of the genome for replacement by dC. A second pathway is proposed to involve CC bond cleavage that converts fdC directly into dC. A 6-aza-5-formyl-deoxycytidine (a-fdC) probe molecule was synthesized and fed to various somatic cell lines and induced mouse embryonic stem cells, together with a 2-fluorinated fdC analogue (F-fdC). While deformylation of F-fdC was clearly observed in vivo, it did not occur with a-fdC, thus suggesting that the CC bond-cleaving deformylation is initiated by nucleophilic activation.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202000414;19.7;20.2;20.8;;31999041;;;;

All rights reserved.Background: A fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) is efficacious in treating chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection; however, objective adherence to prescribed regimens in real-world clinical settings has not been well studied. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate adherence and virologic outcomes in patients with chronic HCV infection treated with LDV/SOF using a novel digital medicine program that directly measures drug ingestion adherence. Methods: This prospective, observational, open-label, single-arm pilot study was conducted at 2 clinical research sites and followed patients with HCV infection who were prescribed LDV/SOF along with an ingestible sensor. Patients were treated for 8 or 12 weeks. The main outcomes were ingestion adherence, medical interventions, virologic response, safety, and patient satisfaction. Results: Of the 28 patients (mean 59 years, SD 7), 61% (17/28) were male, 61% (17/28) were non-Caucasian, and 93% (26/28) were treatment naïve. All 28 had genotype 1 HCV, and of these, 27 completed an 8- or 12-week treatment. Patients used the digital medicine program for 92% of the expected days; the overall mean ingestion adherence rate was 97%. Providers used the digital medicine program data for same-day medication therapy management in 39% (11/28) of patients. End-of-treatment response was achieved in all the available 21 of 28 patients. Sustained virologic response at 12 weeks or more was achieved in 26 of 28 patients; of the 2 patients who relapsed, one had less than 90% adherence and the other had greater than or equal to 95% adherence, lending insights into reasons for treatment failure. A total of 4 subjects reported nonserious adverse events, which were resolved. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that digital medicines can be used for wirelessly observed therapy to support adherence to antiviral HCV therapy, reduce unnecessary medication wastage and retreatment costs, and potentially optimize sustained virologic response rates, especially in populations at high risk for nonadherence.";http://www.jmir.org/2020/2/e15532/;7.3;5.0;3.9;;32352385;e15532;;;

Dimensional response can be relevant both for symptom relief and for survival. Objective: To assess the combined use of trabectedin and radiotherapy in treating patients with progressing metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas. Design, Setting, and Participants: Phase 1 of this nonrandomized clinical trial followed the classic 3 + 3 design, with planned radiotherapy at a fixed dose of 30 Gy (3 Gy/d for 10 days) and infusion of trabectedin at 1.3 mg/m2 as the starting dose, 1.5 mg/m2 as dose level +1, and 1.1 mg/m2 as dose level -1. Phase 2 followed the Simon optimal 2-stage design. Allowing for type I and II errors of 10%, treatment success was defined as an overall response rate of 35%. This study was conducted in 9 sarcoma referral centers in Spain, France, and Italy from April 13, 2015, to November 20, 2018. Adult patients with progressing metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma and having undergone at least 1 previous line of systemic therapy were enrolled. In phase 2, patients fitting inclusion criteria and receiving at least 1 cycle of trabectedin and the radiotherapy regimen constituted the per-protocol population; those receiving at least 1 cycle of trabectedin, the safety population. Interventions: Trabectedin was administered every 3 weeks in a 24-hour infusion. Radiotherapy was required to start within 1 hour after completion of the first trabectedin infusion (cycle 1, day 2). Main Outcomes and Measures: The dose-limiting toxic effects of trabectedin (phase 1) and the overall response rate (phase 2) with use of trabectedin plus irradiation in metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas. Results: Eighteen patients (11 of whom were male) were enrolled in phase 1, and 27 other patients (14 of whom were female) were enrolled in phase 2. The median ages of those enrolled in phases 1 and 2 were 42 (range, 23-74) years and 51 (range, 27-73) years, respectively. In phase 1, dose-limiting toxic effects included grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 5 days in 1 patient at the starting dose level and a grade 4 alanine aminotransferase level increase in 1 of 6 patients at the +1 dose level. In phase 2, among 25 patients with evaluable data, the overall response rate was 72% (95% CI, 53%-91%) for local assessment and 60% (95% CI, 39%-81%) for central assessment. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that the recommended dose of trabectedin for use in combination with this irradiation regimen is 1.5 mg/m2. The trial met its primary end point, with a high overall response rate that indicates the potential of this combination therapy for achieving substantial tumor shrinkage beyond first-line systemic therapy in patients with metastatic, progressing soft-tissue sarcomas.

Methods: This randomized, placebo-controlled, international study included V-EEG seizure monitoring (48-72 hours) at baseline and over the last 3 days of 14-day (5-day dose escalation; 9-day fixed dose) double-blind pregabalin treatment (7 or 14 mg/kg/d in three divided doses). This was followed by a double-blind 1-week taper. The primary efficacy endpoint was log-transformed seizure rate (loge[24-hour seizure rate + 1]) for all FOS recorded during the double-blind V-EEG monitoring, evaluated in subjects who took 1 dose of study medication, experienced 1 baseline seizure(s), and had a treatment phase V-EEG. Safety and tolerability were assessed by adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory data, physical/neurological examinations, vital signs, and electrocardiograms. Results: Overall, 175 patients were randomized (mean age = 28.2 months; 59% male, 69% white, 30% Asian) in a 2:1:2 ratio to pregabalin 7 or 14 mg/kg/d (n = 71 or n = 34, respectively), or placebo (n = 70).

The most frequently reported treatment-emergent AEs for pregabalin 7 mg/kg/d, 14 mg/kg/d, and placebo, respectively, were somnolence (11.3%, 17.6%, and 5.7%) and upper respiratory tract infection (7.0%, 11.8%, and 11.4%). All AEs were mild to moderate in severity. Significance: Pregabalin 14 mg/kg/d (but not 7 mg/kg/d) significantly reduced seizure rate in children with FOS, when assessed using V-EEG, compared with placebo. Both pregabalin dosages were generally safe and well tolerated in children 1 month to <4 years of age with FOS. Safety and tolerability were consistent with the known profile of pregabalin in older children with epilepsy.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/epi.16466;9.4;9.4;9.8;;32189338;;;;

For some patients, the use of an MDI may be optimized with a spacer. This Phase I study assessed the effect of a spacer on lung exposure, total systemic exposure, and safety of BGF MDI 320/36/9.6 g in healthy subjects. Methods: : This randomized, open-label, crossover study assessed the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of BGF MDI in healthy adult subjects who received a single dose of BGF MDI 320/36/9.6 g (administered as 2 inhalations with 160/18/4.8 g per actuation) in 4 regimens: without spacer and no charcoal; with spacer and no charcoal; without spacer and with charcoal; and with spacer and with charcoal. Primary objectives were to assess total systemic exposure (without charcoal) and lung exposure (with charcoal) of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol administered as BGF MDI with and without a spacer. Safety was also assessed. Findings: In total, 56 subjects were randomized (mean age, 29.9 years; 60.7% male, 17.9% former smokers). For systemic exposure (without charcoal), the spacer/without spacer ratio, expressed as a percentage (intrasubject %CV) of Cmax and AUC0–tlast, respectively, was 152.0 (47.5) and 132.8 (43.6) for budesonide, 240.6 (80.2) and 154.7 (73.4) for glycopyrronium, and 165.6 (50.7) and 98.6 (53.8) for formoterol. For lung exposure (with charcoal), the spacer/without spacer ratio percentage (%CV) of Cmax and AUC0–tlast, respectively, was 183.6 (65.9) and 198.4 (71.5) for budesonide, 262.0 (91.8) and 373.9 (120.7) for glycopyrronium, and 222.9 (56.3) and 385.2 (147.0) for formoterol. Subjects who were judged to have suboptimal inhalation technique without a spacer (those in the lowest drug exposure quartile based on AUC0–tlast) had the greatest increase in both total systemic and lung exposure when a spacer was used versus no spacer. Subjects in the highest quartile had a minimal change in both total systemic and lung exposure when the spacer was used. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (all mild/moderate) reported by >1 subject per regimen were headache, cough, and dizziness. One subject withdrew because of TEAEs of headache and presyncope (neither considered treatment-related). Implications: Drug delivery can be improved for subjects with suboptimal MDI inhalation technique when using a spacer device with BGF MDI triple therapy.

All rights reserved.The fixed-dose combination of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BD foam) in aerosol foam formulation is approved for the treatÂment of plaque psoriasis, and showed prompt onset of action, persistent efficacy and safety both in clinical trials and in real-life studies. The use of Cal/BDfoam and its future perspectives of use were discussed during the symposium ""Go beyond with topical treatment in psoriasis"", held at the 2019 World Congress of Dermatology. We herein present the key topics of the symposium, namely the importance of Cal/BDfoam in overcoming poor adherence, the possibility of a proactive (long-term) management of psoriasis and its potential role beyond mild psoriasis. Furthermore, proper adherence to treatment is crucial to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. In clinical trials and real-life experiences, Cal/BDfoam has proven to have a fast onset of action and a good benefit/risk ratio due to increased efficacy and similar safety profile compared with other Cal/BDformulations. Given its chronic nature, psoriasis requires a long-term management, also due to the presence of underlying 'silent' inflammation that persists beyond resolution of flares. Cal/BD foam appears a favorable treatment for long-term management, and a specific trial is ongoing to investigate this new proactive approach. Lastly, evidence both from clinical studies and real-life experiences supports the use of Cal/BDfoam in patients with moderate-to-severe disease, and this approach also showed greater effectiveness over some non-biologic systemic treatments. Therefore, Cal/BDfoam may be considered as the new gold standard in topical therapy for patients with plaque psoriasis.";https://www.minervamedica.it/index2.php?show=R23Y2020N02A0212;1.9;1.8;1.5;;32394674;;;;

However, the adverse systemic side-effects of oxybutynin, the most widely used agent, are of concern. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of solifenacin in pediatric patients with NDO, aged 6 months–<5 years and 5–<18 years. Study design: Two open-label, baseline-controlled, phase 3 studies were conducted in pediatric patients with NDO. Patients were treated with sequential doses of solifenacin oral suspension (pediatric equivalent doses 2.5–10 mg) for 12 weeks to determine each patient's optimal dose, followed by a fixed dose 40-week treatment period. Primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity (MCC) after 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints included bladder compliance, bladder volume until first detrusor contraction (>15 cmH2O), number of overactive detrusor contractions (>15 cmH2O), maximum catheterized volume (MCV)/24 h, and incontinence episodes/24 h. Safety parameters were treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events, laboratory variables, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and ocular accommodation and cognitive function assessments. Results: After 24 weeks, MCC had significantly increased compared with baseline in patients aged 6 months –<5 years and 5–<18 years (37.0 ml and 57.2 ml, respectively; P < 0.001; Fig.). Improvement was also observed after 52 weeks’ treatment. Significant changes were observed from baseline to week 24 in all secondary endpoints in both age groups: increase in bladder compliance, increase in bladder volume to first detrusor contraction as a percentage of expected bladder capacity, reduction in the number of overactive detrusor contractions, increase in MCV, and decreased incontinence episodes. TEAEs were mostly mild or moderate, and there were no new drug-related TEAEs compared with adult studies. Age-related improvements were noted in ocular accommodation and cognitive function. Discussion: These long-term multicenter investigations demonstrated the efficacy and safety of solifenacin in pediatric patients with NDO. The observed increases in MCC were clinically relevant and demonstrated that an increase in fluid volume can be accommodated in the bladder prior to reaching intravesical pressures that endanger kidney function and/or are associated with leakage or discomfort. Solifenacin was well tolerated with low incidences of constipation and dry mouth (typically associated with antimuscarinics), central nervous system–related side-effects, and facial flushing. Conclusion: Solifenacin was effective and well tolerated in pediatric patients with NDO, aged 6 months–<18 years, suggesting that it is a viable alternative to oxybutynin, the current standard of care.

This study was conducted to evaluate whether the efficacy of NEPA against chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in cycle 1 would be maintained over subsequent chemotherapy cycles in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (AC). The study also describes the relationship between efficacy on day 1 through 5 (overall period) and control of CINV on day 6 through 21 (very late period) in each cycle. Methods: In this multicentre, phase II study, patients received both NEPA and dexamethasone (12 mg intravenously) just before chemotherapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall complete response (CR; no emesis and no rescue medication use) in cycle 1. Sustained efficacy was evaluated during the subsequent cycles by calculating the rate of CR in cycles 2-4 and by assessing the probability of sustained CR over multiple cycles. The impact of both overall CR and risk factors for CINV on the control of very late events (vomiting and moderate-to-severe nausea) were also examined. Results: Of the 149 patients enrolled in the study, 139 were evaluable for a total of 552 cycles; 97.8% completed all 4 cycles. The proportion of patients with an overall CR was 70.5% (90% CI, 64.1 to 76.9) in cycle 1, and this was maintained in subsequent cycles. The cumulative percentage of patients with a sustained CR over 4 cycles was 53%. NEPA was well tolerated across cycles. In each cycle, patients with CR experienced a significantly better control of very late CINV events than those who experienced no CR. Among the patients with CR, the only predictor for increased likelihood of developing very late CINV was pre-chemotherapy (anticipatory) nausea (adjusted odds ratio = 0.65-0.50 for no CINV events on cycles 3 and 4). Conclusion: The high anti-emetic efficacy seen with the NEPA regimen in the first cycle was maintained over multiple cycles of adjuvant AC for breast cancer. Preliminary evidence also suggests that patients achieving a CR during the overall period gain high protection even against very late CINV events in each chemotherapy cycle.";https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-020-6707-9;5.9;5.0;4.7;;32188417;232;;;

Alternative formulations of these drugs are being developed for individuals who have difficulty swallowing tablets. Two phase 1 trials were conducted, both in 24 healthy adults, to assess the pharmacokinetics of uncoated and coated oral granule formulations of doravirine, lamivudine, and TDF administered alone and with vanilla pudding or apple sauce. The pharmacokinetics for all uncoated granules, and of coated lamivudine and TDF granules, were similar to those of currently marketed tablets (geometric mean ratios [GMRs] 0.92–1.04). Coated doravirine granules had decreased AUC0– (11%) and Cmax (23%) values versus the tablet. The pharmacokinetics were similar for uncoated and coated doravirine granules administered with or without pudding (GMRs 0.96–1.10); administration with apple sauce increased doravirine AUC0– (26–29%), Cmax (56–59%), and C24 (20–21%) versus administration of granules alone. Lamivudine granules administered with pudding or apple sauce decreased AUC0– and Cmax (14–25%) versus granules alone. Tenofovir AUC0–, Cmax, and C24 increased for TDF granules administered with pudding or apple sauce versus alone (11–23%).

Materials and methods: This was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-design, placebo-controlled study in adolescents with obesity. A total of 42 adolescents were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo, or to a mid-dose (PHEN/TPM 7.5 mg/46 mg), or a top-dose (PHEN/TPM 15 mg/92 mg) of VI-0521. A total of 26 adolescents were included in the PK analysis (14 from the mid-dose group and 12 from the top-dose group). Results: On day 56, arithmetic means of terminal elimination half-life, apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent central volume of distribution (Vc/F) were consistent across dose levels for both PHEN and TPM. Arithmetic means of CL/F and Vc/F for PHEN and TPM administered as a combination in adolescents with obesity were within 10% to 30% of those previously assessed in adults with obesity enrolled in phase II and III studies. A higher proportion of adolescents in both the mid- and top-dose groups (13.3% and 50.0%, respectively) compared with placebo (0.0%) reached 5% weight loss at day 56. The least squares (LS) mean change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to day 56 was 5.2 mmHg for the placebo group, 2.5 mmHg for the mid-dose group, and  5.5 mmHg for the top-dose group. The LS mean change in diastolic blood pressure from baseline to day 56 was 2.4 mmHg for the placebo group, +3.8 mmHg for the mid-dose group, and + 2.0 mmHg for the top-dose group. Participants in the top-dose group had increases in heart rate from baseline of 4.1 bpm, while participants in the mid-dose group experienced a mean decrease in heart rate of 4.5 bpm at day 56. Both PHEN/TPM dose combinations were safe and well tolerated. Conclusions: Treatment of adolescents with obesity using a fixed-dose combination of PHEN/TPM for 8 weeks resulted in exposure to PHEN and TPM that was comparable to that observed in adults, statistically significant weight loss, and a tolerable safety profile. These data indicate that both mid- and top-dose levels are appropriate for longer-term safety and efficacy studies in adolescents.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dom.13910;11.8;9.3;9.5;;31696603;;;;

Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2020.Background: Wixela® Inhub® is a dry powder inhaler approved as a generic equivalent to Advair® Diskus® (fluticasone propionate [FP]/salmeterol fixed-dose combination) for patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study aimed at confirming the local (lung) therapeutic equivalence of both the FP and salmeterol components of Wixela Inhub (test [T]) to Advair Diskus (reference [R]) after inhalation. Methods: This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in patients 18 years with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma compared the local therapeutic equivalence (using forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]) of FP/salmeterol (100/50 g) after inhaled delivery via T and R. Results: Randomized patients (N = 1127) received T (n = 512), R (n = 512), or placebo (n = 103). T and R significantly increased day 1 FEV1 area under the effect curve over 12 hours of the change from baseline (AUC[0-12]) and day 29 trough FEV1 over placebo, indicating that these endpoints were sufficiently sensitive for evaluation of bioequivalence. On day 1, T and R each increased FEV1 AUC(0-12) over placebo (3.134 L•h [T], 2.677 L•h [R]; each p < 0.0001). Following twice-daily dosing for 28 days, T and R also each increased trough FEV1 (measured on day 29) over placebo (235 mL [T], 215 mL [R]; each p < 0.0001). Least-squares mean T/R ratios (90% confidence intervals) for day 1 FEV1 AUC(0-12) and day 29 trough FEV1 were 1.120 (1.016-1.237) and 1.069 (0.938-1.220), respectively, indicating that T and R were bioequivalent for both co-primary endpoints. FP/salmeterol was well tolerated when administered via either T or R. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the therapeutic effects of Wixela Inhub are bioequivalent to Advair Diskus in the lung. Wixela Inhub represents a therapeutically equivalent new FP/salmeterol treatment option for use in the treatment of asthma and COPD.";https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/jamp.2019.1547;5.5;5.7;5.6;;31634023;;;;

In a previous flexible dose study, dasotraline demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of binge-eating disorder (BED). The aim of this confirmatory fixed-dose study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of dasotraline in the treatment of patients with BED. METHODS: Patients meeting DSM-5 criteria for BED were randomized to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with dasotraline (4 mg/d or 6 mg/d), or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in number of binge-eating days per week at week 12. Secondary efficacy endpoints included changes at Week 12 on the Binge Eating Clinical Global Impression of Severity Scale (BE-CGI-S), the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Modified for Binge Eating (Y-BOCS-BE), and the proportion of patients with 100% cessation of binge-eating episodes during the final 4 weeks of treatment. Efficacy was assessed using an MMRM analysis (and a logistic regression model for cessation) with a pre-specified sequential testing procedure used to control overall type I error rate. RESULTS: A total of 486 were in the ITT population (dasotraline 6 mg/d (N=162), 4 mg/d (N=161), or placebo (N=163). At week 12, treatment with dasotraline was associated with significant reduction in number of binge-eating days per week in the 6 mg/d group vs. placebo (-3.5 vs. -2.9; P=0.0045), but non-significant improvement in the 4 mg/d group vs. placebo (-3.2; P=0.12). Greater improvement was observed vs. placebo for dasotraline 6 mg/d and 4 mg/d, respectively, on the BE-CGI-S (P<0.01 and P<0.03) and the Y-BOC-BE (P<0.001 and P<0.02; all P-values were nominal, not adjusted for multiplicity). The proportion of patients who achieved 4-week cessation of binge-eating episodes was only significant for the dasotraline 6 mg in the completer population (P<0.05; post-hoc analysis) but was not significant for either dose of dasotraline vs. placebo when drop-outs were included in the analysis. The most common adverse events on dasotraline 6 mg/d and 4 mg/d were combined insomnia (early, middle, late), dry mouth, headache, decreased appetite, nausea, and anxiety. Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were minimal. Mean baseline to endpoint changes in supine pulse rate on dasotraline 6 mg/d and 4 mg/d vs. placebo was +6.2 bpm and +4.8 vs. +0.2 bpm. CONCLUSIONS: In this 12-week, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study, treatment with dasotraline 6 mg/d was associated with a significant reduction in frequency of binge-eating days per week; efficacy was not demonstrated for the 4 mg dose. Treatment with both doses of dasotraline resulted in improvement in the Y-BOCS-BE and the BE-CGI-S. Dasotraline was safe and generally well-tolerated at both doses; most common adverse events were insomnia, dry mouth and headache.Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03107026.

However, we could not evaluate the hematological properties of the PEG-A3C protein in rats because human GM-CSF is inactive in rodents. To study the biological effects of PEGylated GM-CSF analogs in rodents we created a homologous site-specific PEGylated murine (mu) GM-CSF (T3C) protein. muGM-CSF and the T3C protein were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by column chromatography. The purified T3C protein was covalently modified with a linear 20 kDa- or a branched 40 kDa-maleimide-PEG, and the monoPEGylated proteins purified by column chromatography. muGM-CSF, T3C and the two PEG-T3C proteins had comparable in vitro biological activities, as measured by stimulation of proliferation of the murine FDC-P1 cell line. The PEG-T3C proteins had 10- to 25-fold longer circulating half-lives than muGM-CSF and stimulated greater and longer lasting increases in neutrophils and white blood cells than muGM-CSF following a single intravenous or subcutaneous administration to rats. Treatment of rats made neutropenic with cyclophosphamide with the PEG-T3C proteins shortened the time for recovery of neutrophils to normal levels from 9 or 10 days to 5 or 6 days, whereas muGM-CSF showed no benefit versus vehicle solution. Acceleration of neutrophil recovery in cyclophosphamide-treated rats required a minimum of three PEG-T3C treatments over five days. The PEG-T3C proteins should prove useful for evaluating the potential therapeutic benefits of GM-CSF and long-acting GM-CSF proteins in rodent disease models.;None;2.1;2.0;2.0;;32172395;;;;

Methods Trial design: International, multicenter, randomised, partially double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial. Participants Males and females aged 45-74 years with IFG, IGT or IFG+IGT, recruited from primary care centres in Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Kuwait, Poland, Serbia, Spain and Turkey. Intervention Participants were randomized to placebo; metformin 1.700 mg/day; linagliptin 5 mg/day or fixed-dose combination of linagliptin/metformin. All patients were enrolled in a lifestyle intervention program (diet and physical activity). Drug intervention will last 2 years. Primary Outcome: Composite end-point of diabetic retinopathy estimated by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Score, urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, and skin conductance in feet estimated by the sudomotor index. Secondary outcomes in a subsample include insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, biomarkers of inflammation and fatty liver disease, quality of life, cognitive function, depressive symptoms and endothelial function. Results One thousand three hundred ninety one individuals with hyperglycaemia were assessed for eligibility, 424 excluded after screening, 967 allocated to placebo, metformin, linagliptin or to fixed-dose combination of metformin + linagliptin. A total of 809 people (91.1%) accepted and initiated the assigned treatment. Study sample after randomization was well balanced among the four groups. No statistical differences for the main risk factors analysed were observed between those accepting or rejecting treatment initiation. At baseline prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was 4.2%, severe neuropathy 5.3% and nephropathy 5.7%.

Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a novel tenofovir prodrug with a 90% reduction in plasma tenofovir concentrations. We aimed to assess the non-inferiority of a TAF-containing combination regimen versus a TDF-containing fixed-dose single-tablet regimen in the antiretroviral-treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected patients. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Trial Registry, from January 2001 to July 2019, using relevant keywords. Available data were extracted from eligible randomized trials (RCTs) and pooled as risk ratios (RRs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) in a meta-analysis model using Stata/SE. Results: We included seven eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 6269 participants. Patients who were antiretroviral-naive adults with HIV-1 on both the TAF-containing regimens and the TDF-containing regimens had similar virologic suppression effects (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00–1.04; p > 0.05) at week 24 (93.99% vs. 94.20%), week 48 (90.71% vs. 89.54%), and week 96 (86.16% vs. 84.80%). Both groups had no significant improvements in CD4 cell count for the naive patients during 48 weeks of therapy (SMD, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.16; p < 0.05). Both treatments were safe and well-tolerated, and most adverse events were similar as mild to moderate in severity. Moreover, compared with the TDF-containing regimens, the TAF-containing regimens in patients had significantly smaller reductions in both hip (RR, 0.33; 95CI, 0.29-0.39; p < 0.05) and spine (RR, 0.58; 95CI, 0.51–0.65; p < 0.05). Additionally, the TAF-containing regimens in patients had significantly fewer increases for renal events than those of the TDF-containing regimens through 48 weeks (0.31; 95% CI, 0.18–0.55; p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis indicated that efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TAF-containing regimens were non-inferior in fixed-dose single-tablet regimens for initial treatment of HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, compared with those receiving the TDF-containing regimens, patients on the TAF-containing regimens had significant advantages in renal function, bone parameters, and lipid profile for the naive patients.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1201971220300370;5.3;5.6;5.3;S1201971220300370;31988012;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1201971220300370;;

The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacies of various antihypertensive therapies in our hypertension (HTN) clinic (monotherapy vs. combination therapy, fixed-dose combination (FDC) versus free equivalent combination (FEC), and diuretics versus non-diuretics. Material/Methods: In this retrospective study, patients at the HTN clinic of the Third Xiangya Hospital with primary hypertension were enrolled from June 2016 to February 2017. Data on participants' basic characteristics, blood pressure data, and treatment modalities were collected. The proportions of participants attaining target blood pressure after treatment with antihypertensive modalities were calculated and compared. Results: Among 1900 participants, combination therapy had a better control efficacy than monotherapy (P<0.0005). When HTN was treated by 2 kinds of drugs, FEC was used much more frequently than FDC (P<0.0005). In grade 3 HTN, FDC had a higher control rate (P=0.002). If more than 2 kinds of drugs were used, FDC+OTHER had a slightly higher control rate in grade 2 and 3 (42.1% vs. 38.5%, P=0.724; 36.2% vs. 31.0%, P=0.526, respectively). Therapies with diuretics had better control rates than those without diuretics (43.1% vs. 36.9%, P=0.025). Conclusions: In our clinic, FEC was prescribed more often than FDC.

We compare hydrometric and isotopic approaches to estimate indices of dynamic and total basin storage, respectively, and assess inter-basin differences in these indices across the Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM) region of southern Ontario, Canada. Dynamic storage indices for the 20 study basins included the ratio of baseflow to total streamflow (baseflow index BFI), Q99 flow and flow duration curve (FDC) slope. Ratios of the standard deviation of the streamflow stable isotope signal relative to that of precipitation were determined for each basin from a 1 year bi-weekly sampling program and used as indicators of total storage. Smaller ratios imply longer water travel times, smaller young water fractions (Fyw, < ~2–3 months in age) in streamflow and greater basin storage. Ratios were inversely related to BFI and Q99, and positively related to FDC slope, suggesting longer travel times and smaller Fyw for basins with stable baseflow-dominated streamflow regimes. Inter-basin differences in all indices reflected topographic, hydrogeologic and LULC controls on storage, which was greatest in steep, forest-covered headwaters underlain by permeable deposits with thick and relatively uniform unsaturated zones. Nevertheless, differential sensitivity of indices to controls on storage indicates the value of using several indices to capture more completely how basin characteristics influence storage. Regression relationships between storage indices and basin characteristics provided reasonable predictions of aspects of the streamflow regime of test basins in the ORM region. Such relationships and the underlying knowledge of controls on basin storage in this landscape provide the foundation for initial predictions of relative differences in streamflow response to regional changes in climate and LULC.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.13731;6.3;6.2;6.2;;;;;;

However, HAART does not provide HIV/AIDS patients with a sterilizing or functional cure, and introduces several deleterious comorbidities. Moreover, the virus is able to persist within latent reservoirs, both undetected by the immune system and unaffected by HAART, increasing the risk of a viral rebound. The field of immunoengineering, which utilizes varied bioengineering approaches to interact with the immune system and potentiate its therapeutic effects against HIV, is being increasingly investigated in HIV cure research. In particular, nanoparticle-based immunoengineered approaches are especially attractive because they offer advantages including the improved delivery and functionality of classical HIV drugs such as antiretrovirals and experimental drugs such as latency-reversing agents (LRAs), among others. Here, we present and discuss the current state of the field in nanoparticle-based immunoengineering approaches for an HIV cure. Specifically, we discuss nanoparticle-based methods for improving HAART as well as latency reversal, developing vaccines, targeting viral fusion, enhancing gene editing approaches, improving adoptively transferred immune-cell mediated reservoir clearance, and other therapeutic and prevention approaches. Although nanoparticle-based immunoengineered approaches are currently at the stage of preclinical testing, the promising findings obtained in these studies demonstrate the potential of this emerging field for developing an HIV cure.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00789/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;32425949;789;;;

Its production is regulated by the rate-limiting upstream enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). We have recently demonstrated that the major cell type expressing COX-2 in the germinal center is follicular dendritic cell (FDC). In this study, to elucidate the molecular mechanism of PGE2 in COX-2 production, we asked whether mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK and p38 might regulate COX-2 expression. Results: FDC-like cells were used to analyze the phosphorylation kinetics of ERK and p38 and the impact of genetic knockdown. PGE2 stimulation gave rise to a rapid increase of p38 but not ERK phosphorylation. In contrast, IL-1 induced phosphorylation of both MAPKs. Knockdown of p38 resulted in a marked suppression of COX-2 expression induced by either PGE2 or IL-1. ERK knockdown did not significantly affect the effect of PGE2 and IL-1 on COX-2 induction. The differential results of p38 and ERK siRNA transfection were reproduced in the production of prostaglandins and in experiments performed with pharmacologic inhibitors. Conclusions: Our data indicate that p38 is essentially required for PGE2 to induce COX-2 expression in FDC-like cells. The current study helps to expand our understanding of the biological function of FDC at the molecular level and provides a potential rationale for the pharmacologic or genetic approaches to regulate p38 MAPK in the treatment of various inflammatory disorders.;https://bmcimmunol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12865-020-00347-y;4.5;4.9;3.7;;32303181;20;;;

In Ethiopia, there is a paucity of information on the magnitude and factors associated with fatigue among HIV/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) patients. This may lead to under-diagnosis and eventually under-management of the symptom. Methods: Institution based cross-sectional study design was conducted among 609 HIV/AIDS patients who were selected by using a systematic random sampling method. Data were collected by using interviewer administered structured questionnaire. Level of fatigue was measured by Fatigue Severity Scale. Results: The prevalence of fatigue was found to be 51.7%. The factors associated with fatigue were: Parity [AOR = 2.01; 95% CI: 1.09-3.71], CD4 count 200-499 cells/mm3 [AOR = 2.81; 95% CI: 1.58-4.99], anemia [AOR = 4.90 95% CI: 2.40-9.97], co-morbidities [AOR = 3.65; 95% CI: 1.71-7.78], depression [AOR = 3.68 95% CI: 1.99-6.79], not being physically active [AOR = 3.20 95% CI: 1.50-6.81], clinical stage II or IV HIV [AOR = 3.11; 95% CI: 1.51-6.40] and [AOR = 4.08; 95% CI: 1.37-12.14], respectively.

Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground and Aims: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection increases the risk of incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) and progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Previously available direct-acting antiviral regimens are not approved for patients with advanced CKD across all HCV genotypes. Methods: EXPEDITION-5 is a phase 3 study to evaluate efficacy and safety of the fixed-dose combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (G/P) for chronic HCV infection (genotype 1 through 6) in adults without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis and with stage 3b, 4 or 5 CKD. Patients received approved duration of G/P according to HCV genotype, cirrhosis status and prior HCV treatment experience. The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage of patients with sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12). Results: Among the 101 patients enrolled in the study, 24% had predialysis CKD and 76% were on dialysis. Eighty-four patients were treated with G/P for 8 weeks, 13 patients for 12 weeks and four patients for 16 weeks. Fifty-five per cent of patients had genotype 1, 27% had genotype 2, 15% had genotype 3 and 4% had genotype 4, and none had genotype 5 or 6 infection. The SVR12 rate was 97% (98/101, 95% confidence interval, 91.6-99.0). No patients experienced virologic failure. Adverse events (AEs) reported in at least 5% of the patients were pruritus, bronchitis, hypertension and generalized pruritus. Serious AEs were reported in 12% of patients; none related to study drug. Conclusions: G/P treatment yielded high SVR12 rates irrespective of the presence of stage 3b, 4 or 5 CKD.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with cough, sputum production or dyspnoea, and a reduction in lung function, quality of life, and life expectancy. Apart from smoking cessation, no other treatments that slow lung function decline are available. Roflumilast and cilomilast are oral phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitors proposed to reduce the airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction seen in COPD. This Cochrane Review was first published in 2011, and was updated in 2017 and 2020. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral PDE4 inhibitors for management of stable COPD. Search methods: We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register (date of last search 9 March 2020). We found other trials at web-based clinical trials registers. Selection criteria: We included RCTs if they compared oral PDE4 inhibitors with placebo in people with COPD. We allowed co-administration of standard COPD therapy. Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methods. Two independent review authors selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We resolved discrepancies by involving a third review author. We assessed our confidence in the evidence by using GRADE recommendations. Primary outcomes were change in lung function (minimally important difference (MID) = 100 mL) and quality of life (scale 0 to 100; higher score indicates more limitations). Main results: We found 42 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analyses for roflumilast (28 trials with 18,046 participants) or cilomilast (14 trials with 6457 participants) or tetomilast (1 trial with 84 participants), with a duration between six weeks and one year or longer. These trials included people across international study centres with moderate to very severe COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades II to IV), with mean age of 64 years. We judged risks of selection bias, performance bias, and attrition bias as low overall amongst the 39 published and unpublished trials. Lung function. Treatment with a PDE4 inhibitor was associated with a small, clinically insignificant improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) over a mean of 40 weeks compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) 49.33 mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) 44.17 to 54.49; participants = 20,815; studies = 29; moderate-certainty evidence). Forced vital capacity (FVC) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were also improved over 40 weeks (FVC: MD 86.98 mL, 95% CI 74.65 to 99.31; participants = 22,108; studies = 17; high-certainty evidence; PEF: MD 6.54 L/min, 95% CI 3.95 to 9.13; participants = 4245; studies = 6; low-certainty evidence). Quality of life. Trials reported improvements in quality of life over a mean of 33 weeks (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) MD -1.06 units, 95% CI -1.68 to -0.43; participants = 7645; moderate-certainty evidence). Incidence of exacerbations. Treatment with a PDE4 inhibitor was associated with a reduced likelihood of COPD exacerbation over a mean of 40 weeks (odds ratio (OR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.84; participants = 20,382; studies = 27; high-certainty evidence), that is, for every 100 people treated with PDE4 inhibitors, five more remained exacerbation-free during the study period compared with those given placebo (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20, 95% CI 16 to 27). No change in COPD-related symptoms nor in exercise tolerance was found. Adverse events. More participants in the treatment groups experienced an adverse effect compared with control participants over a mean of 39 weeks (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.38; participants = 21,310; studies = 30; low-certainty evidence). Participants experienced a range of gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, or dyspepsia. Diarrhoea was more commonly reported with PDE4 inhibitor treatment (OR 3.20, 95% CI 2.74 to 3.50; participants = 20,623; studies = 29; high-certainty evidence), that is, for every 100 people treated with PDE4 inhibitors, seven more suffered from diarrhoea during the study period compared with those given placebo (number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 15, 95% CI 13 to 17). The likelihood of psychiatric adverse events was higher with roflumilast 500 µg than with placebo (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.54; participants = 11,168; studies = 15 (COPD pool data); moderate-certainty evidence). Roflumilast in particular was associated with weight loss during the trial period and with an increase in insomnia and depressive mood symptoms. Participants treated with PDE4 inhibitors were more likely to withdraw from trial participation; on average, 14% in the treatment groups withdrew compared with 8% in the control groups. Mortality. No effect on mortality was found (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.24; participants = 19,786; studies = 27; moderate-certainty evidence), although mortality was a rare event during these trials. Authors' conclusions: For this current update, five new studies from the 2020 search contributed to existing findings but made little impact on outcomes described in earlier versions of this review. PDE4 inhibitors offered a small benefit over placebo in improving lung function and reducing the likelihood of exacerbations in people with COPD; however, they had little impact on quality of life or on symptoms. Gastrointestinal adverse effects and weight loss were common, and the likelihood of psychiatric symptoms was higher, with roflumilast 500 µg. The findings of this review provide cautious support for the use of PDE4 inhibitors in COPD. In accordance with GOLD 2020 guidelines, they may have a place as add-on therapy for a subgroup of people with persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite optimal COPD management (e.g. people whose condition is not controlled by fixed-dose long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combinations). More longer-term trials are needed to determine whether or not PDE4 inhibitors modify FEV1 decline, hospitalisation, or mortality in COPD.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/14651858.CD002309.pub6;8.6;8.0;7.4;;32356609;CD002309;;;

Thus, we sought to determine whether the CD4/CD8 ratio was associated with development of TB in a cohort of HIV infected individuals on ART followed up for more than a decade in the setting of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Methods The cohort comprised adult patients who started ART between 2001 and 2007 and followed for up to 15 years. Clinical data were collected in retrospective manner. Patients with an AIDS defining illness or a CD4 count <200 cell/L were started with a combination of ART. The participants have clinic visits every 6 months and/or as needed. Poisson regression models were used to identify factors associated with development of incident TB. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the probability of incident TB while on ART. Results A total of 347 patients with a median duration of follow-up on ART of 11.5 (IQR: 10.0–12.5) years were included. Incident TB developed in 47 patients during the 3259 person-years of follow-up, the majority (76.6%) occurred within five year of ART initiation. On univariate analysis, poor ART adherence (RR:2.57, 95% CI: 1.28–5.17), time-updated CD4 cell count of lower than 200 (RR: 4.86, 95%CI 2.33–10.15), or CD4 cell count between 200 and 500 (RR: 4.68, 95% CI: 2.17–10.09), time-updated CD8 cell count lower than 500 (RR: 2.83 95% CI 1.31–6.10), or CD8 cell count over 1000 (RR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.12–4.45), time-updated CD4/CD8 ratio of less than 0.30 (RR: 6.00, 95% CI: 2.96–12.14), lack of normalization of CD4 T-cell count (RR: 6.13, 95% CI: 2.20–17.07), and virological failure (RR: 2.35 (95% CI: 1.17–4.71) were all associated with increased risk of incident TB. In multivariate analysis, however, time-updated CD4/CD8 ratio of less than 0.30 (adjusted RR: 4.08, 95% CI: 1.31–12.68) was the only factor associated with increased risk of developing incident TB (p = 0.015). Similar results were obtained in a sensitivity analysis by including only those virally suppressed patients (n = 233, 69% of all patients). In this group, CD4/CD8 ratio of less than 0.30 was associated with development of incident TB (adjusted RR: 4.02, 95% CI: 1.14–14.19, p = 0.031). Overall, the incidence rate of TB in patients with an updated CD4/CD8 ratio of less than 0.30 was more than 5-fold higher when compared with those with a ratio more than 0.45. Conclusion Low CD4/CD8 ratio is independently associated with an increased risk of incident TB despite viral suppression. CD4/CD8 ratio may serve as a biomarker for identifying patients at risk of TB in patients on ART in the setting of SSA.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233049;5.7;5.4;5.2;;32442166;e0233049;;;

Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of European Academy of Dermatology and VenereologyBackground: Psoriasis is a disease that commonly manifests in adolescence. Up to half of adults with psoriasis develop it before the age of 20. Topical formulations containing corticosteroids and/or vitamin D3 analogs are recommended for treatment. Objective: This phase II study aimed to evaluate the safety, including any potential effect on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and calcium metabolism, and efficacy of fixed-dose combination calcipotriene (0.005%) and betamethasone (0.064% as dipropionate) (Cal/BD) gel in adolescents with psoriasis. Methods: Patients aged 12 to <17 years, with at least mild psoriasis on the body and scalp, received topical Cal/BD gel once daily for 8 weeks. Safety response criteria included adverse drug reactions [ADRs; any adverse event (AE) possibly or probably related to treatment as determined by the investigator; a primary response criterion] and AEs (a secondary response criterion). Only treatment-emergent AEs (events that occurred after the first application of Cal/BD gel or events which started before this and increased in intensity after the first application of Cal/BD gel) are presented here. Efficacy response criteria included controlled disease, by physician's global assessment of disease severity (PGA), following Cal/BD gel treatment. Results: A total of 107 patients (median age 14 years; range 12–16) were enrolled and treated. Eight ADRs were observed in 7 (7%) patients and 38 (36%) patients experienced 1 AE. The most common AEs were headache [6 (6%) patients], nasopharyngitis [6 (6%) patients] and blood parathyroid hormone increased [4 (4%) patients]. One severe AE was reported (attempted suicide) but was considered unrelated to treatment. At the end of treatment, 58% of patients had controlled disease on the body and 69% on the scalp according to PGA. Conclusion: In this uncontrolled phase II study, Cal/BD gel was well tolerated and effective for treating scalp and body psoriasis in adolescents.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.16077;6.8;7.3;6.6;;31721327;;;;

In the present study, the objective was to evaluate the feasibility of using nanocomposite fibrous scaffold to deliver prostacyclin I2 agonist ONO-1301 in combination with BMP2 for treating critical sized bone defect. For this, ONO-1301 at three different concentrations (1.67 g, 5 g, 15 g) and a fixed dose of BMP2 (5 g) was loaded on the scaffold via physical adsorption. The results showed fast release of ONO-1301 for two weeks, whereas BMP2 exhibited slow and sustained release for four weeks. The scaffold with dual factors promoted the migration and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro when compared to the scaffold with BMP2 alone. It also augmented bone tissue regeneration in critical sized rat calvarial defect at 12 weeks; mainly with lower dose of ONO-1301.

The goal of the study was to assess administration of remifentanil combined with propofol regarding the effects of the drug association during sedation and recovery for patients submitted to upper GI diagnostic endoscopy. Method: One hundred and five patients were assessed, randomly divided into three groups of 35 patients. The Control Group was sedated with propofol alone. Study Group 1 was sedated with a fixed dose of 0.2 g.kg-1 remifentanil combined with propofol. Study Group 2 was sedated with 0.3 g.kg-1 remifentanil combined with propofol. We assessed the quality of sedation, hemodynamic parameters, incidence of significant hypoxemia, time for spontaneous eye opening, post-anesthetic recovery time, quality of post-anesthetic recovery, presence of side effects and patient satisfaction. Results: Study Group 1 showed better quality of sedation. The groups in which remifentanil was administered combined with propofol showed shorter eye-opening time and shorter post-anesthetic recovery time compared to the control group. The three groups presented hemodynamic changes at some of the moments assessed. The incidence of significant hypoxemia, the quality of post-anesthetic recovery, the incidence of side effects and patient satisfaction were similar in the three groups. Conclusions: The combination of propofol with remifentanil at a dose of 0.2 g.kg-1 was effective in improving the quality of sedation, and at doses of 0.2 g.kg-1 and 0.3 g.kg-1 reduced the time to spontaneous eye opening and post-anesthetic recovery in comparison to sedation with propofol administered alone.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0034709419300716;1.3;1.5;1.6;S0034709419300716;32482355;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0034709419300716;;

Objective: To evaluate the benefit/risk question about whether patients with asthma who achieve disease control on fixed-dose ICS/LABA combination therapy, such as mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate (MF/F), should continue with this therapy or be stepped down to ICS monotherapy, such as MF. Methods: Using data from 8447 clinically stable patients with persistent asthma in the Safety Pharma Investigation of Respiratory Outcomes trial who had been receiving a stable dose of ICS/LABA for 4 weeks, this post hoc analysis evaluated the risk of serious asthma outcomes (SAOs) (adjudicated hospitalization, intubation, or death) and asthma exacerbation (AEX) (composite of hospitalizations 24 hours, emergency visits <24 hours requiring systemic corticosteroid, or systemic corticosteroid for 3 consecutive days) in participants randomized to remain on ICS/LABA (MF/F) or step down to ICS (MF) for 26 weeks. Results: There was no significant difference in SAO risk among patients maintained on ICS/LABA with MF/F compared with those who stepped down from ICS/LABA to MF (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61, 1.75], P = .913). The risk of AEX was significantly lower in patients maintained on ICS/LABA with MF/F compared with those who stepped down from ICS/LABA to MF (HR, 0.87 [95% CI: 0.78, 0.98], P = .020). Conclusions: In this post hoc analysis of a large clinical trial dataset, maintenance on ICS/LABA with MF/F is not associated with an increased risk of SAOs and also significantly reduces the risk of AEX compared with step-down from ICS/LABA to MF.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2213219820300611;5.6;6.2;6.8;S2213219820300611;31981733;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2213219820300611;;

The economic benefits of a new drug such as CAZ-AVI are required to be assessed against those of available comparators, from the perspective of health care providers and payers, through cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses. The objective of this analysis was to compare the cost-effectiveness of CAZ-AVI versus meropenem in the empirical treatment of appropriate hospitalized patients with HAP/VAP caused by gram-negative pathogens, from the perspective of publicly funded health care in Italy (third-party perspective, based on the data from the REPROVE (Ceftazidime-Avibactam Versus Meropenem In Nosocomial Pneumonia, Including Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia) clinical study; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01808092). Methods: A patient-level, sequential simulation model of the HAP/VAP clinical course was developed using spreadsheet software. The analysis focused on direct medical costs. The time horizon of the model selected was 5 years, with an annual discount rate of 3% on costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Clinical inputs for treatment comparisons were mainly obtained from the REPROVE clinical study data. In addition to clinical outcomes observed in the trial, the model incorporated impact of resistance pathogens, based on data from published studies and expert opinion. Certain assumptions were made for some model parameters due to a lack of data. Findings: The analysis demonstrated that the intervention sequence (CAZ-AVI followed by colistin + high-dose meropenem) versus the comparator sequence (meropenem followed by colistin + high-dose meropenem) provided a better clinical cure rate (+13.52%), which led to a shorter hospital stay (0.40 days per patient), and gains in the number of life-years (+0.195) and QALYs (+0.350) per patient. The intervention sequence had an estimated net incremental total cost of €1254 ($1401) per patient, and the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €3581 ($4000) per QALY gained, well below the willingness-to-pay threshold of €30,000 ($33,507) per QALY in Italy. Implications: The model results showed that CAZ-AVI is expected to provide clinical benefits in hospitalized patients with HAP/VAP in Italy at an acceptable cost compared to meropenem.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0149291820301806;5.6;5.9;5.4;S0149291820301806;32349879;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0149291820301806;;

All Rights Reserved.The major obstacle to a cure for HIV infection is the persistence of replication-competent viral reservoirs during antiretroviral therapy. HIV-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have been developed to target latently infected CD4- T cells that express virus either spontaneously or after intentional latency reversal. Whether HIV-specific CAR-T cells can recognize and eliminate the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) reservoir of HIV-bound immune complexes (ICs) is unknown. We created HIV-specific CAR-T cells using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and a CAR construct that enables the expression of CD4 (domains 1 and 2) and the carbohydrate recognition domain of mannose binding lectin (MBL) to target native HIV Env (CD4-MBL CAR). We assessed CAR-T cell cytotoxicity using a carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) release assay and evaluated CAR-T cell activation through interferon gamma (IFN-) production and CD107a membrane accumulation by flow cytometry. CD4-MBL CAR-T cells displayed potent lytic and functional responses to Env-expressing cell lines and HIV-infected CD4  T cells but were ineffective at targeting FDC bearing HIV-ICs. CD4-MBL CAR-T cells were unresponsive to cell-free HIV or concentrated, immobilized HIV-ICs in cell-free experiments. Blocking intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) inhibited the cytolytic response of CD4-MBL CAR-T cells to Env-expressing cell lines and HIV-infected CD4  T cells, suggesting that factors such as adhesion molecules are necessary for the stabilization of the CAR-Env interaction to elicit a cytotoxic response. Thus, CD4-MBL CAR-T cells are unable to eliminate the FDC-Associated HIV reservoir, and alternative strategies to eradicate this reservoir must be sought.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/10/e00190-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;;32161179;e00190-20;;;

Owing to the consumer preference for inexpensive natural aroma flavors, vanillin production through a biotechnological pathway has become of great interest and commercial value in recent years. In this study, an enzymatic synthetic system for vanillin using a coenzyme-independent decarboxylase (FDC) and oxygenase (CSO2) cascade was reconstituted and optimized. This system produces a slightly higher production yield (40.20%) than the largest yield reported for immobilized FDC and CSO2 (35.00%) with ferulic acid as a substrate. It was previously reported that the low catalytic activity and thermal instability of CSO2 restrict the overall productivity of vanillin. In present study, site-directed mutagenesis was applied to rate-limiting oxygenase CSO2 to generate positive mutants. The production yields of mutants A49P (58.44%) and Q390A (65.29%) were 1.45- and 1.62-fold that of CSO2 wild type, respectively. The potential mechanism for enhanced vanillin production using A49P involved increased thermostability and catalytic efficiency, while that using Q390A was probably associated with a better thermostable performance and increased catalytic efficiency resulting from a larger entrance channel.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00253-020-10433-1;6.4;6.5;6.7;;32130469;;;;

In the phase I part, dose-limiting toxicities were observed in three of six patients treated with 20 mg of Len; the MTD was accordingly defined as 15 mg in our cohort. In the phase II part, the recommended dose of the scVRD regimen showed a 71.4% best overall response rate, with a median overall survival of 14.8 months and a median progression-free survival of 8 months. Severe adverse events ( grade 3) were observed in ~ 15% of the patients, indicating the tolerability and efficacy of the regimen. Less prior treatment was associated with higher probability of durable response. This scVRd regimen may thus be a better fit for MM patients in early-stage relapse.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12185-020-02833-w;3.1;3.5;4.0;;31981096;;;;

Materials and Methods: This is a single-center, single-dose, open-label, randomized, 2-treatment, 2-sequence and 2- period crossover study with a washout period of 7 days. All 28 adult male subjects were required to fast for at least 10 hours prior to drug administration and they were given access to water ad libitum during this period. Thirty minutes prior to dosing, all subjects were served with a standardized high-fat and high-calorie breakfast with a total calorie of 1000 kcal which was in accordance to the EMA Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence. Subsequently, subjects were administered either the test or reference preparation with 240mL of plain water in the first trial period. During the second trial period, they received the alternate preparation. Plasma levels of glibenclamide and metformin were analysed separately using two different high performance liquid chromatography methods. Results: The 90% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of the AUC0-t, AUC0-, and Cmax of the test preparation over those of the reference preparation were 0.9693-1.0739, 0.9598- 1.0561 and 0.9220 - 1.0642 respectively. Throughout the study period, no serious drug reaction was observed. However, a total of 26 adverse events (AE)/side effects were reported, including 24 that were definitely related to the study drugs, namely giddiness (n=17), while diarrheoa (n=3), headache (n=2) and excessive hunger (n=2) were less commonly reported by the subjects.

Due to unavailability of costly Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes-recommended directly acting antiviral drugs, a widely available pan-genotypic combination of Sofosbuvir and Velpatasvir can become an economical option. Data regarding treatment experience of sofosbuvir–velpatasvir combination in chronic kidney disease is scarce. No data from India have been published in patients on renal replacement therapies till now. Methods: This retrospective analysis included all patients of end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis with treatment-naïve chronic HCV infection treated with sofosbuvir (400 mg) and velpatasvir (100 mg) fixed-dose combination. Pretreatment routine investigations were performed, which included HCV viral load, genotype, fibro scan, endoscopy for esophageal varices, and portal vein Doppler. The patients were followed up with HCV viral load to declare sustained virologic response. Result: patients were included with a mean age of 39.8 ± 10.8 years, and 77.4% were male. Genotype 1 was found to be most prevalent (67.7%), with a median viral load of 106copies/ml. Six (19.3%) patients had hepatitis B virus co-infection. Three (9.7%) patients had cirrhosis. Sustained virologic response (SVR12) was achieved in 30 (96.8%) patients, and one (3.2%) patient had relapse. Furthermore, 14 (45.2%) patients underwent renal transplantation, and none of them had relapsed. Dyspepsia (9.7%) was the most common side effect observed with no major adverse effect. Conclusion: Our study showed excellent efficacy with the safety profile of this drug combination in end-stage renal disease patients. However, larger prospective studies and multicenter randomized controlled trials are needed for further confirmation.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0973688319302713;4.4;3.8;2.3;S0973688319302713;;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0973688319302713;;

Otherwise challenging to create via conventional pharmaceutical techniques, 3D printing technologies have been explored for the fabrication of multi-drug loaded dosage forms to reduce pill burden and improve patient adherence. In this study, stereolithography (SLA), a vat polymerisation technique, was used to manufacture a multi-layer 3D printed oral dosage form (polyprintlet) incorporating four antihypertensive drugs including irbesartan, atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. Although successful in its fabrication, for the first time, we report an unexpected chemical reaction between a photopolymer and drug. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirmed the occurrence of a Michael addition reaction between the diacrylate group of the photoreactive monomer and the primary amine group of amlodipine. The study herein demonstrates the importance of careful selection of photocurable resins for the manufacture of drug-loaded oral dosage forms via SLA 3D printing technology.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2214860419314356;6.5;6.8;8.8;S2214860419314356;;101071;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2214860419314356;;

The plasma samples were collected from antiretroviral therapy (ART)-failure experienced individuals from 2016 to 2017 in Yunnan Province, China. The genotyping drug resistance of HIV-1 pol gene fragments was implemented using in-house assay. According to the analysis of RIP and MEGA 7.0, the HIV-1 strains related to URFs were screened for recombinant identification and drug resistance analysis. A total of 130 pol sequences of HIV-1 URF strains were obtained from 1,121 samples. The proportion of HIV-1 URF strains was 11.6% among the ART-failure individuals from 2016 to 2017 in Yunnan. The overall drug-resistance rate of HIV-1 URF strains was 56.9%. Meanwhile, the percentage of protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) resistance was 3.8% (5/130), 36.2% (47/130), and 53.8% (70/130), respectively. Mutations such as M184V/I (35.4%) in NRTIs and K103N/R/S/T (25.4%), V179D/E/T/Y (18.9%), G190A/E/R/S (13.8%), and Y181C (9.2%) in NNRTIs were common among the HIV-1 URF strains relative to other mutations. Factors such as male, sexual transmission pathway, and source of the year 2017 were significantly correlated with the development of HIV-1 URF drug resistance. The emergence of the multiple recombinant forms identified in Yunnan indicates active transmission networks of HIV-1 of different HIV-1 subtype/circulating recombinant forms cross-infection in this region. Therefore, it is necessary to further monitor the molecular epidemiology and drug resistance of HIV-1 in Yunnan.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2019.0041;3.3;3.2;3.4;;31914782;;;;

We sought to use central pharmacy supply data of Mozambique's rural Zambézia Province (2017 population 5.11 million persons; 12.6% adult HIV prevalence in 2016) to examine shortages, stockouts, and trends in availability. Using stock surveillance for 60 weeks in 2014-2015, we assessed availability of 36 medications [4 classes: adult antiretroviral (ARV) medications, pediatric ARVs, anti-TB medications, and antibiotics] and diagnostic test kits (2 rapid tests for HIV; 1 each for malaria and syphilis). We contrasted these to 2018-2019 data. We modeled pharmacy data using ordinal logistic regression, characterizing weekly product availability in four categories: good, adequate, shortage, or complete stockout. We found 166 (7.7%) stockouts and 150 (6.9%) shortages among 2,160 weekly records. Earlier calendar time was associated with reduced medication supplies (p < .001). Certain medication/test kit classes were associated with reduced supply (p < .001). We found an interaction between time and medication class on the odds of reduced supply (p < .001). Pediatric ARVs had a 17.4 (95% confidence interval: 8.8-34.4) times higher odds of reduced medication supply compared with adult ARVs at study midpoint. Trends comparing the first and last weeks showed adult ARVs having 67% and pediatric having 71% lower odds of reduced supplies. Only adult ARV shortages improved amid growing demand. Data from 2018 to 2019 suggest continuing inventory management challenges. Monitoring of drug (especially pediatric) and test kit shortages is vital to ensure quality improvement to guarantee adequate supplies to enable patients and care providers to achieve sustained viral suppression.

As such, studying HIV drug resistance allows for real-time evaluation of evolutionary mechanisms. Characterizing the biological process of drug resistance is also critically important for sustained effectiveness of ART. Investigating the link between “black box” deep learning methods applied to this problem and evolutionary principles governing drug resistance has been overlooked to date. Here, we utilized publicly available HIV-1 sequence data and drug resistance assay results for 18 ART drugs to evaluate the performance of three architectures (multilayer perceptron, bidirectional recurrent neural network, and convolutional neural network) for drug resistance prediction, jointly with biological analysis. We identified convolutional neural networks as the best performing architecture and displayed a correspondence between the importance of biologically relevant features in the classifier and overall performance. Our results suggest that the high classification performance of deep learning models is indeed dependent on drug resistance mutations (DRMs). These models heavily weighted several features that are not known DRM locations, indicating the utility of model interpretability to address causal relationships in viral genotype-phenotype data.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/5/560;5.8;5.3;4.3;;32438586;560;;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In adherent individuals, antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV replication, restores immune function, and prevents the development of AIDS. However, ART is not curative and has to be followed lifelong. Persistence of viral reservoirs forms the major obstacle to an HIV cure. HIV latent reservoirs persist primarily by cell longevity and proliferation, but replenishment by residual virus replication despite ART has been proposed as another potential mechanism of HIV persistence. It is a matter of debate whether different ART regimens are equally potent in suppressing HIV replication. Here, we summarized the current knowledge on the role of ART regimens in HIV persistence, focusing on differences in residual plasma viremia and other virological markers of the HIV reservoir between infected individuals treated with combination ART composed of different antiretroviral drug classes.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/5/489;5.8;5.3;4.3;;32349381;489;;;

The aim of the present study was to compare the expression levels of specific miRNAs, as well as their correlation with markers of response to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, in patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection with and without resistance to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Methods: miRNA assays were performed on plasma samples obtained from 20 HIV-1-positive patients. A total of ten patients were divided into two groups: HAART-responsive and HAART-resistant (n=5 per group). Commercial arrays were subsequently used to identify 84 miRNAs. A total of three differentially expressed miRNAs were selected and analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Five other patients were subsequently added to each group for a new relative expression analysis. The absolute expression level of the two miRNAs was obtained and compared using the Student’s t test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify patients with antiretroviral therapy (ART) resistance. Results: The array analysis revealed that miR-15b-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-126-3p and miR-150-5p were down-regulated in patients with HAART-resistance comparing with HAART-responsive. The expression levels of miR-16-5p, miR-26a-5p and miR-150-5p were confirmed using qPCR. The area under the ROC curve was 1.0 for the three miRNAs. Conclusions: The lower expression levels of miR-16-5p and miR-26a-5p in patients with HAART-resistance suggested that these may serve as potential biomarkers for the identification of HAART-responsive patients.;https://portlandpress.com/bioscirep/article/doi/10.1042/BSR20194433/222736/Plasma-microRNA-expression-levels-in-HIV1positive;3.1;2.9;2.9;;32319513;BSR20194433;;;

Tropical Medicine & International Health Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdObjective: Early identification of confirmed virological failure is paramount to avoid accumulation of drug resistance in patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Scale-up of HIV-RNA monitoring in Africa and timely switch to second-line regimens are challenged. Methods: A WHO adapted confirmed virological treatment screening algorithm (HIV-RNA screening, enhanced adherence counselling, confirmatory HIV-RNA testing) was evaluated in HIV-infected patients on first-line ART from Tanzania. The main endpoints included viral resuppression and virological failure rates, retention and turnaround time of the screening algorithm until second-line ART initiation. Secondary endpoints included risk factors for virological treatment failure and patterns of genotypic drug resistance. Results: HIV-RNA >1000 copies/ml at first screening was detected in 58/356 (16.3%) patients (median time-on-treatment 6.3 years, 25% immunological treatment failure). Adjusted risk factors for virological failure were age <30 years (RR 5.2 [95% CI: 2.5–10.8]), years on ART 3 years (RR 3.0 [1.0–8.9]), CD4-counts <200 cells/µl (RR 9.3 [4.0–21.8]) and poor self-reported treatment adherence (RR 2.0 [1.2–3.4]). Resuppression of HIV-RNA <1000 copies/ml was observed in 5/50 (10%) cases after enhanced adherence counselling. Confirmatory testing within 3 months was performed in only 46.6% and switch to second-line ART within 6 months in 60.4% of patients. Major NNRTI-mutation were detected in all of 30 patients, NRTI mutations in 96.7% and 3 thymidine-analogue mutations in 40%. No remaining NRTI options were predicted in 57% and limited susceptibility in 23% of patients. Conclusion: We observed low levels of viral resuppression following adherence counselling, associated with high levels of accumulated drug resistance. High visit burden and turnaround times for confirmed virological failure diagnosis further delayed switching to second-line treatment which could be improved using novel point-of-care viral load monitoring systems.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tmi.13373;5.3;4.7;4.5;;31984634;;;;

However, not all FDCs are rational. To know the awareness of physicians in prescribing rational FDCs was the need of the hour in order to assess the prescribing trends and rationality of FDCs. Eventually, this will help to formulate the guideline for rational use of FDCs. This was a prospective observational study conducted in All India Institute of Medical Sciences Bhopal, MP, India. Prescriptions were collected over a period of 2 months by the convenience sampling method from hospital pharmacy. The data were subjected to descriptive analysis using Microsoft Excel and Graph Pad Prism. Results were expressed in mean ± standard deviation (SD), percentages and 95% confidence interval. A total of 2496 drugs were prescribed in 1008 prescriptions, of which 945 (37.82%) were FDCs with an average of 0.93 ± 0.94 (mean ± SD) per prescription. Of 945, 67 (7.09%) were included in National List of Essential Medicine 2015 considered as rational. The number of prescriptions containing one or more FDCs was 629 (62.40%). FDCs were more frequently prescribed to male patients (54.92%) and in the age group of 18-30 years (33.44%). FDCs containing a proton pump inhibitor were prescribed most frequently (16.29%) followed by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (13.96%) and multivitamins (7.83%). Prescribing irrational FDCs was very common, and hence there is an obvious need to update our prescribers about the irrationality of FDC and motivate them to develop a habit of rational prescribing.;https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/jbcpp/31/3/article-20190037.xml;2.3;2.8;3.0;;32031977;20190037;;;

Methods: Open-label, single-arm, 48-week pilot trial. HIV-1 infected adults, naïve to integrase inhibitors, with CD4+ above 350 cell/L and fewer than 50 HIV-1 RNA copies per mL the year prior to study entry switched to dolutegravir plus lamivudine. Participants were excluded if baseline proviral DNA population genotyping detected lamivudine resistance-associated mutations. To detect resistance minority variants, proviral DNA next-generation sequencing was retrospectively performed from baseline samples. Primary efficacy endpoint was proportion of participants with fewer than 50 HIV-1 RNA copies per mL at week 48. Safety and tolerability outcomes were incidence of adverse events and treatment discontinuations. ART-PRO is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03539224. Findings: 41 participants switched to dolutegravir plus lamivudine, 21 with lamivudine resistance mutations in historical plasma genotypes. Baseline next-generation sequencing detected lamivudine resistance mutations (M184V/I and/or K65R/E/N) over a 5% threshold in 15/21 (71·4%) and 3/20 (15%) of participants with and without history of lamivudine resistance, respectively. At week 48, 92·7% of participants (38/41) had fewer than 50 HIV-1 RNA copies per mL. There were no cases of virologic failure. Three participants with historical lamivudine resistance were prematurely discontinued from the study (2 protocol violations, one adverse event). Ten participants (4 in the group with historical lamivudine resistance) had a transient viral rebound, all resuppressed on dolutegravir plus lamivudine. There were 28 drug-related adverse events, only one leading to discontinuation. Interpretation: In this pilot trial, dolutegravir plus lamivudine was effective in maintaining virologic control despite past historical lamivudine resistance and presence of archived lamivudine resistance-associated mutations detected by next generation sequencing. Further studies are needed to confirm our results.

An expert group under the guidance of RAV here provides updated recommendations. The most important updates in the present guidelines are the following: (a) The risk of HIV transmission through condomless sex from individuals with fully suppressed HIV viral load is effectively zero. (b) Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is recommended for groups with a high risk of HIV infection. (c) Since the last update, two new substances have been registered: bictegravir and doravirine. (d) Dual treatment may be an alternative in selected patients, using lamivudine + dolutegravir or lamivudine + boosted darunavir/atazanavir.

International Journal of Clinical Practice published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Aim: To assess the impact of baseline characteristics on Men's Sexual Health Questionnaire (MSHQ) total scores and to evaluate the clinical relevance of MSHQ changes and their association with spontaneously reported sexual adverse events (SexAEs) in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Methods: This was a post hoc analysis of the Phase 4 FDC116115 study, in which patients aged 50 years were randomised 1:1 to receive a fixed-dose combination of dutasteride 0.5 mg and tamsulosin 0.4 mg (DUT-TAM FDC), or placebo. End-points included: change in MSHQ total scores by baseline characteristics and SexAEs; cumulative distribution function for change from baseline to month 12 in MSHQ total score and the ejaculation, erection, satisfaction and sexual desire (libido) domain scores; and relationship between changes in MSHQ scores and SexAEs. Results: The intent-to-treat population comprised 489 patients (DUT-TAM FDC, n = 243; placebo, n = 246). The mean reduction in total MSHQ score was greater in patients with SexAEs across both groups, compared with patients without SexAEs. Most patients reporting any SexAE (86% DUT-TAM FDC, 67% placebo) had a worsening of the MSHQ total score at month 12 compared with baseline. Specifically, 90% (DUT-TAM FDC) and 75% (placebo) of patients reporting an ejaculation SexAE and 73% (DUT-TAM FDC) and 87% (placebo) of patients reporting an erection SexAE had a worsening of MSHQ ejaculation and erection domain scores, respectively, at month 12. A threshold effect for incident SexAE was observed; patients showing a decrease of approximately 6-10 points in the total MSHQ score were more likely to report SexAEs. Conclusion: Findings support the clinical utility of the MSHQ tool in assessing the impact of DUT-TAM on sexual function by linking numerical changes in MSHQ scores to spontaneously reported SexAEs for the first time. The threshold effect for incidence of SexAEs warrants further investigation to determine its clinical relevance.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ijcp.13480;4.6;4.4;4.3;;31927774;e13480;;;

Medication charts of 1000 in-patients from general medicine department were reviewed for 12 months excluding casualty and ICUs. The data on morbidities and drugs prescribed were documented and assessed for fixed dose combinations prescribed, their inclusion in WHO essential medicines list and national list of essential medicines and approval by regulatory bodies such as US FDA and DCGI. Rationality of the prescribed fixed dose combinations were determined based on WHO guidelines. The drug-drug interactions with fixed dose combinations were analysed. Descriptive statistics was used to express results in numbers and percentages. Out of 1000 case sheets studied a total of 435 fixed dose combinations were prescribed, all by their brand names during hospitalization. Fixed dose combinations given for infectious diseases were 29.57 % and for respiratory disorders 20.82 %. Those included in WHO essential medicines list 2017 were 11.72 %, while 10.57 % were in the national list of essential medicines 2015 and 17.7% were approved by the US FDA, 56.78 % by DCGI. Rational fixed dose combinations were 38.62 % and 61.37 % were irrational. In the discharge medication chart, miscellaneous agents (19.72 %) and drugs for infectious disorders (15.80 %) were the commonly prescribed fixed dose combinations. Among these 8.25 % were listed in WHO essential medicines list 2017, 6.78 % in the national list of essential medicines 2015 and 15.04 % fixed dose combinations were approved by the US FDA, 53.98 % by the DCGI.

In countries with high rates of infectious diseases, antibiotic resistance is a frequent cause of mortality. The aim was to analyse antibiotic prescribing practices between 2008 and 2017 in a teaching (TH) and a non-teaching (NTH) hospital, as typical hospitals of low- and middle-income countries, and to compare antibiotic prescribing for severe infectious indications for which empiric antibiotic treatment is recommended. Methods: Data from adult patients registered at two Indian private-sector hospitals with one of the following indications: epiglottitis, pneumonia, peritonitis, pyelonephritis, cellulitis, erysipelas, septic arthritis, endocarditis, meningitis or sepsis; were included and analysed. Antibiotic prescription data was analyzed using the World Health Organization's (WHO) Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system and the Defined Daily Doses. Chi-square and linear regression were used to compare the data between groups. Time series analyses were conducted using linear regression. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant. Results: In total, 3766 patients were included, 2504 inpatients in the NTH and 1262 in the TH, of which 92 and 89% patients, respectively, were prescribed antibiotics. Sixty-one percent of total prescriptions in the TH and 40% in the NTH comprised the access category of antibiotics (i.e. the first-choice of treatment according to the WHO). The WHO's second-choice of treatment, the watch category, comprised 29 and 40% of total prescriptions in the TH and NTH, respectively. Prescribing of fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of antibiotics was significantly higher in the NTH (18%) than in the TH (8%, P < 0.05). Prescribing of watch antibiotics and FDCs increased significantly in both hospitals between 2008 and 2017 among patients with pneumonia, cellulitis and peritonitis (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Prescribing of watch antibiotics and FDCs of antibiotics increased over time at both hospitals, indicating under prescribing of access antibiotics and more prescribing of second-choice antibiotics. The results can be used to highlight the areas of improvement in similar settings. Implementing diagnostic routines and local prescribing guidelines could improve the prescribing practices.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05059-7;4.5;4.3;4.1;;32404055;340;;;

They recognize antigens and can present these antigens to naive T lymphocytes. DCs play an important part in the mechanism of adaptive immunity. Namely, they control and regulate adaptive immune responses. DCs secrete cytokines involved in the removal of pathogenic agents. They represent the boundary between innate and adaptive immunity. We can see these cells in lymph nodes, spleen, mucosa and other parts of a body in mammals. Several kinds of dendritic cells differ in positions, structure and functions. One type of DCs is follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). FDCs are located in lymphoid follicles in mammals. FDCs have the main role in binding and retaining antigens by linking to complexes (mainly complement and immune). After they present these pathogenic agents to the germinal center (GC) of B lymphocytes and initiate the secondary immune response. FDCs as well as other DCs play an important part in effective humoral response towards pathogenic agents. Most studies about FDCs are in human and mice and there is a lack of studies that concentrate on bovine follicular dendritic cells (BFDCs). This review provides a brief overview of FDCs in mammals.;https://www.jmbfs.org/issue/april-may-2020-vol-9-no-5/jmbfs_1296_slama/?issue_id=7038&article_id=12;0.1;0.2;0.5;;;;;;

To assess the effect of doubling the rifampicin dose (to 20 mg/kg/day, R20) on efavirenz pharmacokinetics (PK) in HIV/TB coinfected patients. Methods: Open-label Phase 2 drug-drug interaction randomized trial. Pulmonary TB, ART-naive adults were randomized to R20 and either efavirenz 600 mg (EFV600) or 800 mg (EFV800), or rifampicin 10 mg/kg/day (R10) and EFV600 with a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients were first started on TB treatment and 2-4 weeks later started on ART. They were switched to R10 and EFV600 after 8 weeks. Full PK sampling was done 4 weeks (on rifampicin) and 24 weeks (off rifampicin) after ART initiation. Transaminases, plasma HIV-1 RNA and sputum cultures were monitored. The efavirenz geometric mean ratio (GMR) of AUC at 4 and 24 weeks after ART initiation within the same patient was calculated in each arm and its 90% CI was compared with a preset range (0.70-1.43). Results: Of 98 enrolled patients (32 in the R20EFV600 arm, 33 in the R20EFV800 arm and 33 in the R10EFV600 arm), 87 had full PK sampling. For the R20EFV600, R20EFV800 and R10EFV600 arms, GMRs of efavirenz AUC were 0.87 (90% CI: 0.75-1.00), 1.12 (90% CI: 0.96-1.30) and 0.96 (90% CI: 0.84-1.10). Twelve weeks after ART initiation, 78.6%, 77.4% and 72.4% of patients had HIV-1 RNA below 100 copies/mL and 85.7%, 86.7% and 80.0% had Week 8 culture conversion, respectively. Two patients per arm experienced a severe increase in transaminases. Conclusions: Doubling the rifampicin dose had a small effect on efavirenz concentrations and was well tolerated.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/5/1250/5718045;8.7;7.7;8.3;;31999314;;;;

Paradoxically, FLs originate from highly proliferative germinal center (GC) B cells with proliferation strictly dependent on interactions with T follicular helper cells. Herein, we show that EZH2 mutations initiate FL by attenuating GC B cell requirement for T cell help and driving slow expansion of GC centrocytes that become enmeshed with and dependent on FDCs. By impairing T cell help, mutant EZH2 prevents induction of proliferative MYC programs. Thus, EZH2 mutation fosters malignant transformation by epigenetically reprograming B cells to form an aberrant immunological niche that reflects characteristic features of human FLs, explaining how indolent tumors arise from GC B cells.© 2020 Elsevier Inc.Béguelin et al. show that mutant EZH2 epigenetically reprograms germinal center B cells to alter their interactions with T follicular helper cells and follicular dendritic cells, facilitating malignant transformation and establishing characteristic features of the follicular lymphoma immunological niche.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1535610820302038;44.3;37.8;40.7;S1535610820302038;32396861;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1535610820302038;;

Sub-Saharan Africa needs to investigate the effectiveness of such technologies in local contexts and proactively contribute to global decisions around patient-centered TB care. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of pillbox-enabled self-administered therapy (SAT) compared to standard DOT on adherence to TB medication and treatment outcomes in Ethiopia. It also aims to assess the usability, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of the intervention from the patient and provider perspectives. Methods: This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, superiority, effectiveness-implementation hybrid, mixed-methods, two-arm trial. The study is designed to enroll 144 outpatients with new or previously treated, bacteriologically confirmed, drug-sensitive pulmonary TB who are eligible to start the standard 6-month first-line anti-TB regimen. Participants in the intervention arm (n = 72) will receive 15 days of HRZE - isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol - fixed-dose combination therapy in the evriMED500 medication event reminder monitor device for self-administration. When returned, providers will count any remaining tablets in the device, download the pill-taking data, and refill based on preset criteria. Participants can consult the provider in cases of illness or adverse events outside of scheduled visits. Providers will handle participants in the control arm (n = 72) according to the standard in-person DOT. Both arms will be followed up throughout the 2-month intensive phase. The primary outcomes will be medication adherence and sputum conversion. Adherence to medication will be calculated as the proportion of patients who missed doses in the intervention (pill count) versus DOT (direct observation) arms, confirmed further by IsoScreen urine isoniazid test and a self-report of adherence on eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. Sputum conversion is defined as the proportion of patients with smear conversion following the intensive phase in intervention versus DOT arms, confirmed further by pre-post intensive phase BACTEC MGIT TB liquid culture. Pre-post treatment MGIT drug susceptibility testing will determine whether resistance to anti-TB drugs could have impacted culture conversion. Secondary outcomes will include other clinical outcomes (treatment not completed, death, or loss to follow-up), cost-effectiveness - individual and societal costs with quality-adjusted life years - and acceptability and usability of the intervention by patients and providers. Discussion: This study will be the first in Ethiopia, and of the first three in sub-Saharan Africa, to determine whether electronic pillbox-enabled SAT improves adherence to TB medication and treatment outcomes, all without affecting the inherent dignity and economic wellbeing of patients with TB.

Evidence in animal models have shown that markers of intestinal permeability and microbial translocation vary over the course of the day and are affected by food intake and circadian rhythms. However, daily variations of these markers are not characterized yet in PLWH. Herein, we assessed the variation of these markers over 24 h in PLWH receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a well-controlled environment. Methods: As in Canada, PLWH are predominantly men and the majority of them are now over 50 years old, we selected 11 men over 50 receiving ART with undetectable viremia for more than 3 years in this pilot study. Blood samples were collected every 4 h over 24 h before snacks/meals from 8:00 in the morning to 8:00 the next day. All participants consumed similar meals at set times, and had a comparable amount of sleep, physical exercise and light exposure. Plasma levels of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and fungal (13)--D-Glucan (BDG) translocation markers, along with markers of intestinal damage fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) and regenerating islet-derived protein-3 (REG3) were assessed by ELISA or the fungitell assay. Results: Participants had a median age of 57 years old (range 50 to 63). Plasma levels of BDG and REG3 did not vary significantly over the course of the study. In contrast, a significant increase of LPS was detected between 12:00 and 16:00 (Z-score:-1.15 ± 0.18 vs 0.16 ± 0.15, p = 0.02), and between 12:00 and 24:00 (-1.15 ± 0.18 vs 0.89 ± 0.26, p < 0.001). The plasma levels of I-FABP at 16:00 (-0.92 ± 0.09) were also significantly lower, compared to 8:00 the first day (0.48 ± 0.26, p = 0.002), 4:00 (0.73 ± 0.27, p < 0.001) or 8:00 on secondary day (0.88 ± 0.27, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Conversely to the fungal translocation marker BDG and the gut damage marker REG3, time of blood collection matters for the proper evaluation for LPS and I-FABP as markers for the risk of inflammatory non-AIDS co-morbidities. These insights are instrumental for orienting clinical investigations in PLWH.;https://aidsrestherapy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12981-020-00273-4;3.2;3.8;4.4;;32398104;15;;;

Until recently, pharmacological therapy comprised antimuscarinic drugs, but more recently beta 3 agonists have added to the available agents. Traditional reporting of efficacy and safety of these agents relies upon regulatory placebo-controlled studies. There remains no head-to-head comparison of existing agents in the contemporary literature. Contemporary conclusions on comparative efficacy and safety drawn from the use of these agents are based on systematic reviews of the literature and associated meta-analyses. Objective: In this study, we used the analytical model of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to compare contemporary pharmacotherapy for OAB. Evidence acquisition: Efficacy and safety data from published, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of antimuscarinic antagonists, the beta 3 agonist, and the combination of an antimuscarinic and beta 3 agonist were used to populate the MCDA model. Evidence synthesis: Experts assessed weights of the relative importance of favourable and unfavourable effects, which provided a common measure of benefits and safety that were combined in the MCDA model to give an overall ranking of the OAB drugs. Results: When benefits are judged as more important than safety, fesoterodine 4 or 8 mg used in a flexible dosing pattern provides the most favourable therapeutic option, over a wide sensitivity analysis relating to benefits and harms. Conclusions: In our analysis using an MCDA model, in both the flexible dosing pattern of fesoterodine and the solifenacin combination with mirabegron, the benefit-safety balance is better in terms of benefits and/or safety than any of the other available OAB drugs. Caution in interpretation of the data has to be expressed as the fesoterodine data are based on a flexible dosing regimen, which adds an additional dimension of personalising therapy. Patient summary: Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition with a significant impact on the quality of life. Possible symptoms include the following: (1) urgency—a compelling desire to urinate, which is difficult to defer; (2) urgency urinary incontinence—urgency leading to incontinence episodes; (3) frequency—increased frequency of wanting to pass urine; and (4) nocturia—increase in instances of getting up at night to urinate. To date, the mainstay of therapy for OAB has been antimuscarinic drugs and, more recently, the beta 3 agonist mirabegron. Ten international experts in urology, obstetrics, gynaecology, healthy ageing, and data analysis compared the benefit-risk balance of 14 OAB drugs licensed in Europe. The experts considered the importance of a favourable effect on the above four symptoms and also potential for side effects, but only three of these side effects, constipation, dry mouth, and dizziness, showed clinically relevant differences among the six drugs they considered. The observations recorded here suggest interesting differences between drugs across a wide range of possible trade-offs between benefit and safety. The different recruitment criteria used for each study may influence the results seen, so they need to be treated with caution. Comparison of flexibly dosed fesoterodine studies with fixed-dose fesoterodine studies introduces an additional potential bias; definitive conclusions can be drawn only if enough comparable placebo-controlled flexible dosing studies with other drugs were available.© 2019 European Association of UrologyTraditional reporting of pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder (OAB) relies upon regulatory placebo-controlled studies.

KGaA, WeinheimAntiretroviral fixed-dose-combination drugs are best assayed with high-performance liquid chromatography, or liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. However, most scientists in developing nations have no access to these expensive instruments. A more affordable quantitative technique is the use of ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy—where often the absorption spectra of these antiretrovirals are overlapping; thus complex derivative methodologies are required for quantification. A simple, rapid, and accurate thin layer chromatography–ultraviolet spectrophotometric method for the quantification of binary mixtures of lamivudine, zidovudine, and tenofovir–disoproxil–fumarate in tablet formulations was developed. Lamivudine/tenofovir–disoproxil–fumarate and lamivudine/zidovudine were extracted and separated on glass thin-layer chromatography plates. Drugs were identified in ultraviolet light at 254 nm and quantified in acidic medium using ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The retardation factors were 0.43, 0.79, and 0.81 for lamivudine, tenofovir–disoproxil–fumarate, and zidovudine, respectively, with corresponding absorption maxima at 270, 260, and 265 nm.

RECENT FINDINGS: Although awareness has improved in recent years that children in TB endemic areas suffer a huge disease burden, translation into better prevention and care remains challenging. Recent WHO guidelines have incorporated screening of all household contacts of pulmonary TB cases, but implementation in high incidence settings remains limited. Improved tests using noninvasive samples, such as the lateral flow urinary lipoarabinomannan assay and the new Xpert Ultra assay applied to induced sputum or stool in young children, are showing promise and further assessment is eagerly awaited. From a treatment perspective, child-friendly dispersible fixed dose combination tablets are now widely available with excellent acceptability and tolerance reported in young children. SUMMARY: High-level government commitment to TB control as a public health priority and feasible strategies to achieve this are required to contain the global epidemic, whereas strong engagement of local TB clinics and affected families in TB prevention is essential to limit secondary cases and protect exposed children.;http://journals.lww.com/10.1097/MOP.0000000000000897;4.7;4.6;4.3;;32374579;;;;

Although FP/SAL FDC has been the first long-acting FDC approved in COPD, no systematic review assessed the effect of this combination for the treatment of COPD by considering specifically Phase IV studies. The aim of this review was to systematically assess the effect of FP/SAL FDC in COPD patients enrolled in Phase IV studies. Areas covered: The question of this systematic review was to examine the evidence regarding the impact of FP/SAL FDC for the treatment of COPD by searching for Phase IV studies in the ClinicalTrials.gov database. Expert opinion: Generic drugs represent an effective cost-saving step for health-care budgets in the treatment of COPD and should be used in agreement with current recommendations and prescription accuracy. FP/SAL FDC is recommended for the initiation therapy just in a small percentage of symptomatic patients that are at high risk of exacerbation with blood eosinophil counts 300 cells per l. At follow-up, FP/SAL FDC can be escalated to triple ICS/LABA/LAMA combination or switched to LABA/LAMA combination by considering symptoms, exacerbations, lack of response to ICS, inappropriate original indication, and ICS-related adverse events such as pneumonia.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17476348.2020.1743180;3.7;4.0;4.2;;32168461;;;;

The traditional Sanger sequencing method is capable of detecting drug resistant mutations (DRMs) that make up at least 10–15% of the viral quasispecies population. Newer next generation sequencing technologies have a greater sensitivity for the detection of minority variant DRMs down to around 1% of the population. Objectives: Here NGS sequencing on the Vela Diagnostics automated next generation sequencing platform was evaluated and compared to the currently used Sanger sequencing method. Study design: Sequences from both methods were obtained from a total of 79 patients, with a range of subtypes (CRF01_AE, A1/G, A1/CRF01_AE, A1/CRF02_AG, A1, A, B, C, CRF01_AG, CRF 06_CPX, D, G, B/G, CRF 57_BC/C, G/CRF 02_AG and CRF 14_BG/G) and viral loads (2.43–7 log10 copies/ml). Results: A high concordance was seen between the two methods for subtyping (96%) and majority variant detection (97.9%). NGS sequencing detected more variants and DRMs than Sanger sequencing. Of the 76 patient samples 86% (n = 66) had identical drug resistance reports. From the ten discrepant reports, nine had extra DRMs detected by NGS sequencing and all discrepancies were seen for NRTI and NNRTI antiviral resistance. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a good performance of the NGS method for HIV-1 genotyping compared to the Sanger sequencing method for detection of majority variants, however the reproducibility for the detection of minority variants was sub-optimal. Adoption of an NGS sequencing approach has the potential to improve the clinical management of HIV-infected patients.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1386653220301189;5.7;6.0;5.9;S1386653220301189;32344322;104376;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1386653220301189;;

The current study classifies the methods applied to multi-terminal transmission lines. Moreover, investigated solutions for the drawbacks that appeared with the previous methods are suggested. Based on wavelet packet transform, a scheme for a multi-terminal transmission line is presented in this article. The suggested technique uses the wavelet packet transform (WPT) to get the approximate and detail coefficients of the differential current and model voltage for all buses in a system, detects and classifies the faults (FDC) within a half-cycle window, and identifies the faulted section (FSI). A fast mother wavelet is used with a three-coefficient high pass filter to analyze signals of the model voltage and differential. In this regard, two frequency levels were chosen, in which the first level of the differential current signal was chosen to detect and classify a fault, while the first level of the model voltage signal was chosen to identify the faulted section. Several fault cases are simulated and analyzed in the ATP/EMTP environment for an N-terminal system followed by successful testing on three- and five-terminal systems to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. The simulation results obtained show that the proposed scheme is efficient and shows high speed and accuracy of fault detection compared to other methods in the literature.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378779620300924;5.2;6.4;7.0;S0378779620300924;;106286;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0378779620300924;;

Soil-pipe interaction (SPI) thus is very important for the assessment and design of resilient pipeline systems. Previous work on SPI modeling has been based on crude assumptions, such as representation of the soil as uncoupled three-dimensional bilinear springs, and quasi-static loading conditions. This paper proposes a simplified macroelement designed to capture the effects of dynamic SPI in cohesionless soils subjected to arbitrary loading normal to the pipeline axis. First, we present the development of a uniaxial hysteresis model that can capture the smooth nonlinear reaction force-relative displacement curves (FDCs) of SPI problems. Using the unscented Kalman filter, we derived the model parameter  that controls the smoothness of transition zone from linear to plastic using published empirical and experimental data. We extended this uniaxial model to biaxial loading effects, and showed that the macroelement can capture effects such as pinching and shear-dilation coupling. The model input parameters were calibrated using finite-element (FE) analyses validated by experiments. The FDCs of the biaxial model were verified by comparison with FE and smoothed-particle hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations for different loading patterns: cyclic uniaxial, 0-shaped, 8-shaped, and transient loading. Accounting for smooth nonlinearity, hysteresis, pinching, and coupling effects, the proposed biaxial macroelement showed good agreement with FE and SPH analyses, while maintaining the computational efficiency and simplicity of beam on nonlinear Winkler foundation models, as well as a small number of input parameters.;http://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29GT.1943-5606.0002230;5.2;5.5;6.0;;;04020035;;;

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of first-line chemoendocrine treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Biochemical assessment was performed of serum levels of thymidine phosphorylase enzyme (TP), serum tamoxifen, hydroxytamoxifen, and 5-fluorouracil in relationship to efficacy. Patients and Methods: This prospective phase 2 interventional study studied patients with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2 metastatic breast cancer who received either tamoxifen/capecitabine or letrozole/capecitabine as first-line treatment. The dose of capecitabine provided at 2000 mg per day continuously as a fixed dose. Results: Forty women with a median age of 49.3 years were enrolled. For the whole study group, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10 months and median overall survival (OS) was 23.3 months. The overall response rate was 60% and the clinical benefit rate 82.5%. Progesterone receptor positivity was associated with significantly longer PFS (12 vs. 7 months, P = .021). The most frequent adverse events were palmar–plantar erythrodysesthesia (62.5%), fatigue (62.5%), diarrhea (30%), abdominal pain (12.5%), and constipation (10%). Changes in serum level of TP were not correlated to response to treatment, PFS, or OS. Higher serum levels of tamoxifen and hydroxytamoxifen were correlated with higher response rates and longer PFS but not OS. Conclusion: Chemoendocrine treatment is well tolerated, with no evidence of contradictory effects between the combination components. However, the efficacy data need more validation.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1526820920300021;4.3;3.6;3.9;S1526820920300021;32005499;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1526820920300021;;

Participants IeDEA is organised in four regions (Central, East, Southern and West Africa), with 240 treatment and care sites, six data centres at African, European and US universities, and almost 1.4 million children, adolescents and adult people living with HIV (PLWHIV) enrolled. Findings to date The data include socio-demographic characteristics, clinical outcomes, opportunistic events, treatment regimens, clinic visits and laboratory measurements. They have been used to analyse outcomes in PLWHIV-1 or PLWHIV-2 who initiate ART, including determinants of mortality, of switching to second-line and third-line ART, drug resistance, loss to follow-up and the immunological and virological response to different ART regimens. Programme-level estimates of mortality have been corrected for loss to follow-up. We examined the impact of coinfection with hepatitis B and C, and the epidemiology of different cancers and of (multidrug resistant) tuberculosis, renal disease and of mental illness. The adoption of 'Treat All', making ART available to all PLWHIV regardless of CD4+ cell count or clinical stage was another important research topic. Future plans IeDEA has formulated several research priorities for the 'Treat All' era in sub-Saharan Africa. It recently obtained funding to set up sentinel sites where additional data are prospectively collected on cardiometabolic risks factors as well as mental health and liver diseases, and is planning to create a drug resistance database.;https://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035246;3.7;3.6;3.5;;32414825;e035246;;;

Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.Background. The combination of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir is a potent, pangenotypic regimen suitable for mass-scale hepatitis C treatment, especially in resource-limited countries where newer, expensive combinations are not available. This combination has been widely tested on genotype 4. However, Phase III trials of this combination in other genotypes have been cost prohibitive. With the introduction of generic, low-cost sofosbuvir and daclatasvir, large-scale studies in resource-limited countries are now possible. Methods. Sofosbuvir at 400 mg and daclatasvir at 60 mg were coformulated into a fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet (Sovodak, Rojan Pharma, Tehran, Iran). Patients from 46 centers were dosed for 12 or 24 weeks with or without ribavirin, in line with existing guidelines. Responses to treatment were evaluated 12 weeks after the end of treatment (for a sustained virological response at Week 12; SVR12). Results. There were 1361 patients recruited. Overall, the patients were 21% female, with a mean age of 50 years; 39% were cirrhotic; 22% were treatment-experienced; 47% were genotype 1, 41% were genotype 3, and 2% were other genotypes. The genotype was not known in 10% of the patients. The intention-to-treat and per-protocol SVR12 rates were 94.7% and 98.8%, respectively. The safety profile was unremarkable, treatment was well tolerated, and compliance with the single-tablet regimen was excellent. Conclusions. The treatment with FDC of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir achieved high SVR12 rates, equivalent to those seen in Phase III trials of other pangenotypic options, and has been conducted at a similar scale in a representative, real-world population at a cost of under $100 per patient, which makes this combination suitable for elimination protocols in resource-limited countries.";https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/70/10/2206/5531032;14.0;13.8;12.5;;31504303;;;;

KGaA, WeinheimPolypharmacy is often needed for the management of cardiovascular diseases and is associated with poor adherence to treatment. Hence, highly flexible and adaptable systems are in high demand to accommodate complex therapeutic regimens. A novel design approach is employed to fabricate highly modular 3D printed “polypill” capsules with bespoke release patterns for multiple drugs. Complex structures are devised using combined fused deposition modeling 3D printing aligned with hot-filling syringes. Two unibody highly modular capsule skeletons with four separate compartments are devised: i) concentric format: two external compartments for early release while two inner compartments for delayed release, or ii) parallel format: where nondissolving capsule shells with free-pass corridors and dissolution rate-limiting pores are used to achieve immediate and extended drug releases, respectively. Controlling drug release is achieved through digital manipulation of shell thickness in the concentric format or the size of the rate limiting pores in the parallel format. Target drug release profiles are achieved with variable orders and configurations, hence confirming the modular nature with capacity to accommodate therapeutics of different properties. Projection of the pharmacokinetic profile of this digital system capsules reveal how the developed approach can be applied in dose individualization and achieving multiple desired pharmacokinetic profiles.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adhm.202000236;8.9;9.5;10.8;;32510859;2000236;;;

Obesity Science & Practice published by World Obesity and The Obesity Society and John Wiley & Sons LtdObjective: There is an unmet medical need for a safe and effective weight loss product with minimal systemic side-effects. In this study, the effect of a novel modified-release fixed-dose combination of orlistat and acarbose (MR-OA) was compared with conventional orlistat (CO) regarding tolerability, appetite and glucose metabolism. Methods: Sixty-seven men with obesity, aged 24 to 60 years with body mass indexes (BMIs) 33 to 40 kg m2 or BMIs 30 to 32 kg m2 and waist circumference above 102 cm were included. They were randomized to either three different doses of the test formulation MR-OA (60 mg orlistat/20 mg acarbose, 90/30 and 120/40) or CO (Xenical, 120 mg orlistat) for a 2-week study of daily treatment. The participants spent days 1 and 14 at the clinical research centre where they received standardized meals, had blood sampling and filled in questionnaires regarding tolerability and appetite after meals. In days 2 to 13, the participants were at home and continued to fill in the questionnaires daily. Results: In the MR-OA groups, reports of liquid and oily stools as well as faecal incontinence were fewer, whereas reports of gastric distension and flatulence were higher, compared with the CO group. More participants reported decreased hunger in the 90/30 and 120/40 MR-OA, and postprandial plasma glucose concentration was reduced in all MR-OA groups compared with CO. Conclusions: This study shows that by using a modified-release dosage form, orlistat and acarbose can be combined without compromising tolerability. Furthermore, MR-OA shows promising effects regarding reduction of appetite and reduces postprandial glucose. Tolerability is coupled to compliance and thereby efficacy of a treatment; therefore, this novel combination MR-OA could be an effective approach for weight loss treatment. A follow-up study in a more diverse population and for a longer duration with weight loss as primary outcome variable is planned.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/osp4.405;0;0;2.6;;;;;;

The fault identification model, based on Petri-net technology, is developed using an automated mapping/facilities management/geographic information system (AM/FM/GIS). The proposed method uses data that include the statuses of fault indicators and circuit breakers, the available pre-current and post-current measurements of FIs, and the loadings of a feeder and a lateral. Communications capabilities are added to these fault indicators to develop a centralized asset management system that can dispatch crews to fault locations faster, accelerating restoration. A distribution feeder of Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) was simulated. Simulation results from the test case reveal the effectiveness of the use of communication-capable fault indicators for managing the assets in a distribution system as part of the proposed method.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9176836/;0;0;0;;;9176836;;true;9781728171951

Here we explore phenotypic drug resistance in such patients in order to better understand this phenomenon. Patients (n = 71) failing a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen, but who subsequently re-suppressed on the same regimen, were assessed for HIV-1 genotypic drug resistance through Sanger sequencing. A subset (n = 23) of these samples, as well as genotypically matched samples from patients who did not re-suppress (n = 19), were further assessed for phenotypic drug resistance in an in vitro single cycle assay. Half of the patients (n = 36/71, 51%) harboured genotypic drug resistance, with M184V (n = 18/36, 50%) and K103N (n = 16/36, 44%) being the most prevalent mutations. No significant difference in the median time to re-suppression (31-39 weeks) were observed for either group (p = 0.41). However, re-suppressors with mutant virus rebounded significantly earlier than those with wild-type virus (16 vs. 33 weeks; p = 0.014). Similar phenotypic drug resistance profiles were observed between patients who re-suppressed and patients who failed to re-suppress. While most remained susceptible to stavudine (d4T) and zidovudine (AZT), both groups showed a reduced susceptibility to 3TC and NNRTIs. HIV- 1 infected patients on an NNRTI-based regimen can achieve viral re-suppression on the same regimen despite harbouring viruses with genotypic and phenotypic drug resistance. However, re-suppression was less durable in those with resistance, reinforcing the importance of appropriate regimen choices, ongoing viral load monitoring and adherence counselling.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234937;5.7;5.4;5.2;;32555643;e0234937;;;

The power stage of the equalizer is composed of a bidirectional buck-boost converter to shuttle the balancing charge between two individual cells bi-directionally. The SOC-inspected equalization strategy can achieve charge transfer more accurately than that of the conventional voltage-measured process, due to the characteristic curve between the OCV versus SOC of the LIB is flatter among the SOC mid-range values. Hence, a compensated OCV-based SOC estimation method is addressed to lower the inaccurate SOC estimation during the equalization process. Furthermore, the switches' duty cycle of the converter is kept constant in the conventional method, thus the balancing current will decrease and slow down the balancing speed correspondingly with the decrease in SOC differences. To settle this problem, two equalization mechanisms, i.e. duty cycle adjustment (DCA) method and curve-fitting method (CFM), are devised. These presented techniques can modulate the duty cycle based on the SOC difference and keeps the shuttling charge nearly constant during the entire equalizing phase. Experimental results are provided to confirm feasibility and effectiveness. Comparing with fixed-duty-cycle (FDC) approach and DCA method, the proposed method owns the best balancing efficiency of 81.4%, and it can improve the balancing time by 27.1 % and 18.6 %, respectively.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9152488/;0;0;0;;;9152488;;true;9781728156354

Methods: A single nucleotide polymorphism of ABCB1 3435C>T (rs1045642) in the gene encoding ABCB1 was genotyped using real-time PCR-based alleles in 149 HIV-infected Thai adults receiving efavirenz treatment. Plasma concentrations of efavirenz were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography 12 hr after administration. The relationship between plasma efavirenz concentrations and ABCB1 3435C>T polymorphisms was analyzed. Results: Logistic regression analysis showed no significant predictors of high plasma efavirenz concentration in relation to age, gender, body weight, CD4 count and plasma HIV-1 RNA, blood biochemical parameters, antiretroviral duration or ABCB1 3435C>T polymorphisms, except for height (OR=0.902, 95% CI: 0.835-0.973) (P<0.05). The minor allele frequency of ABCB1 3435C>T was 0.446. The frequency of the heterozygous mutant ABCB1 3435C/ T was 53.02% (n=79), ABCB1 3435T/T homozygous mutant was 18.12% (n=27) and the wild type ABCB1 3435C/C genotype was 28.86% (n=43). The overall median plasma concentration of efavirenz in 149 HIV-infected Thai cases was 2.41 mg/L [IQR: (1.46-4.12) mg/L]. The plasma concentration of efavirenz was higher in cases with ABCB1 3435T/T homozygous mutant [2.73 mg/L, IQR: (2.02-4.19) mg/L] and ABCB1 3435C/T heterozygous mutant [2.29 mg/L, IQR: (1.41-4.28) mg/L] genotypes compared to the wild type ABCB1 3435C/C homozygous [2.1 mg/L, IQR: (1.37-3.53) mg/L]. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the efavirenz concentration between the different genotypes (P>0.05). Conclusions: There is no statistical significance for a tendency toward higher plasma efavirenz concentration in the ABCB1 3435T/T and ABCB1 3435C/T genotypes. No parameters of physiological characteristics in this study except for height were found to be predictors of high plasma efavirenz concentration in Thai HIV-1 infected cases.;None;3.7;3.2;4.1;;;;;;

Hence, topical therapy is the most frequent employed treatment in psoriasis also because it can be easily combined with systemic therapy. In this context, calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BD) fixed-dose association represents the first-line treatment due to its efficacy and once-daily application. Different Cal/BD formulations, such as ointment, gel (topical suspension), and aerosol foam, are approved by US Food and Drug Administration. Areas covered: For this review, relevant English literature (trials, real-life studies, case series, and reviews) regarding Cal/BD different formulations efficacy in psoriasis was searched for through to 28 January 2020. The following database were consulted: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, EBSCO, and clinicaltrials.gov. Expert opinion: Cal/BD formulations are efficacious treatment for psoriasis. Cal/BD aerosol foam shows a higher efficacy compared to Cal/BD ointment or gel formulations, appearing as a game-changer in psoriasis therapy not only for mild disease but also for moderate psoriasis as well as in selected severe cases in combination with systemic treatments.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1744666X.2020.1776116;6.0;5.5;5.9;;32476507;;;;

This increase was accompanied by a shift in the predominant HIV subtype from B to CRF01_AE. Increasing evidence points to a difference in treatment responses between subtypes. We examined treatment failure and acquired drug resistance (ADR) in people living with HIV (PLHIVs) after one year on antiretrovirals (ARVs). Methods: PLHIV maintained on ARVs for one year were recruited. Treatment failure was defined as a viral load of 1000 copies/mL. Sanger sequencing for genotyping and drug resistance mutation (DRM) detection was performed on patients failing treatment. Results: 513 PLHIV were enrolled. The most common antiretroviral regimens were TDF+3TC + EFV (269) and AZT+3TC + EFV (155). 53 (10.3%) subjects failed treatment. Among these, 48 (90.6%) had DRMs, 84.9% were subtype CRF01_AE. Tenofovir-based regimens performed worse than zidovudine-based regimens (OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.58–7.52 p < 0.001). Higher rates of NRTI, NNRTI, K65R tenofovir resistance, and multi-class resistance were found compared to those reported in literature. Conclusions: HIV treatment failure at one year of treatment in the Philippines is 10.3%. We found unusually high tenofovir and multiclass resistance, and optimal ARV regimens may need to be reevaluated for CRF01_AE-predominant epidemics.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1201971220300783;5.3;5.6;5.3;S1201971220300783;32081778;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1201971220300783;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the diarylpyrimidine (DAPY) analogs etravirine (ETR) and rilpivirine (RPV) have been widely effective against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) variants that are resistant to other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). With non-inferior or improved efficacy, better safety profiles, and lower doses or pill burdens than other NNRTIs in the clinic, combination therapies including either of these two drugs have led to higher adherence than other NNRTI-containing treatments. In a separate development, HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) have shown efficacy in treating AIDS, including raltegravir (RAL), elvitegravir (EVG), cabotegravir (CAB), bictegravir (BIC), and dolutegravir (DTG). Of these, DTG and BIC perform better against a wide range of resistance mutations than other INSTIs. Nevertheless, drug-resistant combinations of mutations have begun to emerge against all DAPYs and INSTIs, attributable in part to non-adherence. New dual therapies that may promote better adherence combine ETR or RPV with an INSTI and have been safer and non-inferior to more traditional triple-drug treatments. Long-acting dual-and triple-therapies combining ETR or RPV with INSTIs are under study and may further improve adherence. Here, highly resistant emergent mutations and efficacy data on these novel treatments are reviewed. Overall, ETR or RPV, in combination with INSTIs, may be treatments of choice as long-term maintenance therapies that optimize efficacy, adherence, and safety.;https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/13/6/122;6.1;5.0;5.4;;;122;;;

Recently, a topical lotion of the combination of halobetasol 0.01% plus tazarotene 0.045% (HP/TAZ) was approved for treating adult plaque psoriasis. Currently, no head-to-head studies have compared Cal/BD foam with HP/TAZ lotion. Objective: Compare the effectiveness and drug incremental cost per responder (ICPR) of Cal/BD foam vs. HP/TAZ lotion in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Methods: An anchor-based, matching-adjusted indirect comparison was conducted for PGA treatment success (Physician’s Global Assessment of “clear” or “almost clear,” [PGA 0/1] with at least a 2-point improvement) using individual patient data from 3 randomized clinical studies of Cal/BD foam and published data from 2 randomized, Phase 3 clinical studies of HP/TAZ lotion. The number needed to treat and ICPR were also calculated. Results: After reweighting of patients in the Cal/BD foam studies to match summary baseline characteristics of the HP/TAZ lotion study patients and anchoring to vehicle effect, 4 weeks of Cal/BD foam produced a significantly greater rate of treatment success than 8 weeks of HP/TAZ lotion treatment (51.4 vs. 30.7%; treatment difference = 20.7%, p <.001). The number needed to treat with Cal/BD foam was also less than HP/TAZ lotion (1.9 vs. 3.3). Using US wholesale acquisition costs and equal weekly consumption rates, the incremental cost per PGA 0/1 responder relative to vehicle for Cal/BD foam was $3,988 and was 37% lower compared with HP/TAZ lotion ($6,294). Conclusions: The indirect comparison analyses showed that Cal/BD foam was associated with a greater rate of treatment success, lower ICPR, and quicker treatment response than HP/TAZ lotion in adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.";https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13696998.2020.1722139;3.5;3.3;3.3;;31985301;;;;

As such ensuring further reduction in MTCT is a priority in HIV treatment and prevention programs. Areas covered: This review aims to provide a comprehensive update on the pharmacokinetics of recently approved antiretroviral drugs and novel drug formulations and delivery systems. Alongside recent recommendations for dose adjustments, and an overview of the implications of co-infections on the pharmacokinetics of antiretrovirals relevant to pregnant HIV positive patients. Additionally, potential opportunities to progress pharmacokinetic research of new treatments in this population are highlighted. Expert opinion: In order to improve our understanding of how to provide safe and effective treatment to HIV positive pregnant women, further work is required to enable their inclusion in early stages of clinical trials. Incentives must be created for this research, in the form of additional investment by key stakeholders and regulatory agencies. Furthermore, as the incidence of MTCT is reduced globally there is a need to conduct long-term pharmacovigilance studies in uninfected children exposed to HIV and antiretrovirals in utero, in order to determine the safest and most effective antiretroviral therapies.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17425255.2020.1754792;5.7;5.9;6.4;;32271621;;;;

Subunit vaccines comprise the majority of current preparations and consist of two main components—antigen and adjuvant. The antigen is a small molecule against which the vaccine induces an immune response to provide protection via the immunostimulatory ability of the adjuvant. Our laboratory has investigated the adjuvant properties of Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand-based adjuvants, especially the outer membrane protein from Neisseria mengingitidis, PorB. In this current study we used PorB, along with CpG, an intracellular TLR9 agonist, and a non-TLR adjuvant, aluminum salts (Alum), to further investigate cellular mechanisms of adjuvanticity, focusing on the fate of intact antigen in the germinal center and association with follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). FDCs are located in the B cell light zone of the germinal center and are imperative for affinity maturation. They are stromal cells that retain whole intact antigen allowing recognition by the B cell receptor of the germinal center B cells. Our studies demonstrate that TLR ligands, but not Alum, increase the FDC network, while PorB and Alum increased colocalization of FDC and the model soluble antigen, ovalbumin (OVA). As PorB is the only adjuvant tested that induces both a higher number of FDCs and increased deposition of antigen on FDCs, it has the greatest ability to increase FDC-antigen interaction, essential for induction of B cell affinity maturation. These studies demonstrate a further mechanism and potential superiority of PorB as an adjuvant and its influence on antibody production.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01254/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;32636846;1254;;;

A post hoc subgroup analysis of the primary data from an active-/placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-centre, parallel-group study was conducted in patients with moderate or severe baseline pain. Methods: After dental surgery, patients with moderate or severe pain, which was determined on a 4-point verbal rating scale (‘no pain’ to ‘severe pain’), received a single dose of ibuprofen 400 mg/caffeine 100 mg FDC, ibuprofen 400 mg, caffeine 100 mg or placebo. Pain relief (PAR) and pain intensity were assessed 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 h after administration of study medication. The primary study endpoint was the time-weighted sum of PAR and pain intensity difference (PID) from pre-dose baseline, summed for all post-dose assessment times from 0 to 8 h (SPRID0–8h). Results: There were 237 patients with moderate pain and 325 with severe pain at baseline. SPRID0–8h was significantly improved with the FDC versus ibuprofen, caffeine and placebo in the moderate and severe pain subgroups. Adjusted mean SPRID0–8h difference for the FDC versus ibuprofen was 18.19 (p < 0.0001) for patients with moderate pain and 7.70 (p = 0.0409) for patients with severe pain. With the exception of the 7-h measurement in patients with moderate pain, PID was significantly improved with the FDC versus ibuprofen at all measured time points from 0.5 to 8 h. In the severe pain subgroup, PID was significantly improved for the FDC versus ibuprofen from 0.5 to 3 h post-dose, but was not significantly different thereafter. Conclusion: The enhanced analgesic efficacy of ibuprofen/caffeine FDC versus ibuprofen is most pronounced in patients with moderate intensity pain at baseline, and also evident in patients with severe baseline pain.

These medications are known for the efficacy in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction and weight neutral effect with minimal hypoglycaemia occurrence. This study aimed to identify the outcomes of DPP-4i use in one of the largest tertiary public hospital in Southeast Asia. Methods: This is a retrospective cross sectional study conducted in 2016, where stratified sampling method was used. Patients with T2DM treated with available DPP-4i; namely Linagliptin, Saxagliptin, Sitagliptin and Vildagliptin, for at least 3 months were identified from the pharmacy record. Medical records from Physician Clinic in Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL) were reviewed. Data on demographic, anthropometric, antidiabetic treatment modalities, laboratory and documented outcomes were collected. Outcomes endpoints which include changes in HbA1c, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and body weight were recorded and analysed. Adverse drug reactions (ADR) documented were also reported. Results and discussion: A total of one hundred and five patients were recruited. The patients were 49.5% men (n = 52), with a mean age of 57 years, mean HbA1c of 8.5% (69 mmol/mol) and mean BMI of 29.5 kg/m2. At least 50% of the patients had T2DM for more than 10 years and more than two third of these patients had both T2DM and hypertension. Thirty nine patients were on Vildagliptin, 32 on Sitagliptin, 26 on Saxagliptin and the remaining on Linagliptin. The most commonly prescribed DPP-4i were Vildagliptin and Sitagliptin. Majority of the patients (90.4%) were prescribed with Metformin, with 62.8% of patients on fixed-dose combination, and the remaining on add-on Metformin therapy. Use of DPP-4i as an adjunct was associated with a mean reduction of 0.9% (9 mmol/mol) in HbA1c (p < 0.0001) and 1.15 mmol/L (19.82 mg/dL) in FBG (p = 0.001) without significant weight changes (p = 0.745). Sitagliptin had the highest reduction in HbA1c (1.66%,19 mmol/mol; p-value< 0.0001). Twelve ADRs were reported with the highest report on gastrointestinal intolerance (n = 7). None of the ADR reported caused any significant harm to the patients. Conclusion: Overall, use of these DPP-4i as an adjunct antidiabetic was associated with reduction in HbA1c.";https://joppp.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40545-020-00238-y;1.6;2.8;2.8;;;34;;;

Follow-up samples from 56 HBV/HIV co-infected patients, 25 with occult HBV infection (OBI) and 31 with chronic HBV infection (CHB), were available for analysis. HBV viral loads were quantified at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-ART initiation by the COBAS TaqMan HBV Test 48 assay, and the HBV polymerase gene was amplified with an in-house nested polymerase chain reaction assay. During 24 months of lamivudine-based ART, 6 of 8 (75%) OBI and 4 of 6 (67%) CHB patients achieved undetectable levels of HBV DNA, while 2 patients had persistent HBV DNA levels  2 × 105 despite lamivudine-based ART for 24 months. HIV viremia was undetectable in all patients at 12 months, suggesting high adherence to ART. Several lamivudine-associated HBV resistance mutations, including L180M, A181T, M204I, and M204V, were observed. Sequence analysis also revealed a rare genotype G infection. While resource-limited settings may use lamivudine-based ART because of availability and low cost, antivirals with dual therapy against HBV and HIV (e.g., lamivudine and tenofovir) should always be recommended with the regular monitoring of HBV viremia levels.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/6/634;5.8;5.3;4.3;;32545313;v12060634;;;

It is therefore important to assess poor inhaler adherence as a possible cause of suboptimal response to ICS/LABA FDC before additional GINA-5. Objective: To determine rates of, and time to, additional GINA-5 after first-year ICS/LABA FDC use, and their association with inhaler adherence. Methods: Patients initiating ICS/LABA FDC between 2013 and 2017 were identified from Australian national dispensing data. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to estimate medication adherence patterns. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between adherence trajectories and GINA-5 addition during 2-year follow-up. Results: In total, 3062 new ICS/LABA FDC users were identified, of whom 120 (3.9%) received additional GINA-5 (OCS: 89; long-acting muscarinic antagonists: 39; biologics: <3). Mean time to commencing additional GINA-5 was 705.2 (standard deviation, 1.7) days. Adherence trajectories were nonpersistent use (20%), seasonal use (8%), poor adherence (58%), and good adherence (13%). Although poor adherence was associated with longer time to additional GINA-5 (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.58; 95% confidence interval: 0.35-0.95), over 80% of additional GINA-5 was commenced in poorly adherent patients. Use of 2 OCS/antibiotic courses also predicted additional GINA-5. Conclusions: Almost 1 in 20 people with asthma commenced additional GINA-5 after ICS/LABA initiation, most of whom (>80%) were poorly adherent to inhaled preventers. There is a substantial unmet need for inhaler adherence to be addressed before prescribing additional GINA-5.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2213219819310220;5.6;6.2;6.8;S2213219819310220;31857262;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2213219819310220;;

The aim of this study was to examine the influence of very high baseline HIV-RNA levels on long-term virological responses under one type of regimen. Methods: A retrospective study was performed based on data from two multicenter cohorts in China from January to November 2009, and from May 2013 to December 2015. Untreated HIV infected adults between 18 and 65 years old were recruited before receiving non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimen. All patients had baseline HIV-RNA levels over 500 copies/ml, good adherence, and were followed for at least 24 weeks. Virological suppression was defined as the first HIV-RNA < 50 copies/ml. Virological failure was defined as any of incomplete viral suppression (HIV-RNA  200 copies/ml without virological suppression within 24 weeks of treatment) and viral rebound (confirmed HIV-RNA level  50 copies/ml after virological suppression). Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox proportional hazards model and Logistic regression were used to compare virological response between each pretreated viral load stratum. Results: A total of 758 treatment-naïve HIV patients in China were enlisted. Median follow-up time (IQR) was 144 (108-276) weeks. By week 48, rates of virological suppression in three groups (< 100 000, 100 000-500 000 and  500 000 copies/ml) were 94.1, 85.0, and 63.8%, respectively (P < 0.001). Very high baseline HIV viremia over 500 000 copies/ml were found to be associated with delayed virological suppression ( 500 000 vs < 100 000, adjusted relative hazard = 0.455, 95% CI: 0.32-0.65; P < 0.001) as well as incomplete viral suppression ( 500 000 vs < 100 000, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 6.084, 95% CI: 2.761-13.407; P < 0.001) and viral rebound ( 50 000 vs < 100 000, aOR = 3.671, 95% CI: 1.009-13.355, P = 0.048).

All rights reserved.Background: Despite the availability of effective antiemetic regimens, patients still experience chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). 5-Hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists (RAs) are the mainstay of CINV prevention, and updated antiemetic guidelines include new options. Objective: The aim of this study was to highlight advances in CINV management, focusing on new 5-HT3 RA formulations in adults, updated antiemetic guidelines, and the role of nurses. Methods: MEDLINE searches were conducted for English-language publications for the past 15 years using relevant search terms (""serotonin receptor antagonist,""""5-HT3 receptor antagonist,""""antiemetic,""""chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting"") in the abstract or title. Abstracts at relevant major congresses for the past 3 years and additional pivotal publications were included. The most informative, relevant, and current publications were included. Results: 5-Hydroxytryptamine 3 RAs are effective in preventing acute (0-24 hours) CINV but less effective in the delayed phase (24-120 hours) given their short half-lives. Updated antiemetic guidelines include fixed-dose intravenous fosnetupitant and palonosetron (IV NEPA) and granisetron extended-release subcutaneous injection, a recently approved 5-HT3 RA formulation providing slow, controlled release of therapeutic granisetron concentrations for 5 days or longer. Nurses play a pivotal role in implementing updated guideline-recommended antiemetic regimens for highly and some moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens, comprising a 4- or 3-drug regimen of 5-HT3 RA, neurokinin-1 RA, and dexamethasone, with/without olanzapine. Conclusion: Newer antiemetic combinations and formulations provide flexibility for CINV prevention. Granisetron extended-release subcutaneous injection is a convenient subcutaneous granisetron option. Implications for Practice: Nurses play a critical role in understanding and using new antiemetic formulations and updated antiemetic guidelines in their practices.";https://journals.lww.com/00002820-900000000-99065;3.2;3.5;3.5;;30688665;;;;

We measured prevalence of antihypertensive polypharmacy (40 days concomitant exposure), inappropriate antihypertensive combinations (against guideline recommendations; within-class polytherapy) and combinations to be used with caution.Results:Almost half (47.5%) of people using antihypertensives in 2018 experienced polytherapy. Among these, 2.4% had an inappropriate combination (1.5% against guidelines; 1.0% within-class polytherapy). Inappropriate combinations were more prevalent in people experiencing polytherapy with three (3.7%) or four (16.1%) antihypertensive medicines than people on dual therapy (0.7%). Inappropriate combinations occurred at a lower rate in people using fixed-dose rather than free-drug combinations for dual therapy (0 vs. 0.7%) and in those using three antihypertensives (2.4 vs. 7.3%); this was not the case for people using four or more antihypertensives (15.5 vs. 16.1%). Between 2013 and 2018, the prevalence of antihypertensive polytherapy was relatively stable (49-47%); however, the prevalence of inappropriate combinations among these patients halved (from 5.1 to 2.4%).Conclusion:Antihypertensive polytherapy in Australia is common, but the prevalence of inappropriate combinations is low and decreasing over time, suggesting strong awareness of Australian clinical guidelines. However, in 2018, approximately 49000 Australian adults experienced inappropriate polytherapy; prescribing of fixed-dose combinations in patients on dual or triple therapy may further reduce this inappropriate care, although increased vigilance treating patients with more than 3 antihypertensives is required.";https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/HJH.0000000000002408;7.2;6.6;6.7;;32084043;;;;

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is the most commonly prescribed antiretroviral drug globally. Studies show that patients receiving TDF are more prone to renal dysfunction at some point in time during treatment. Evaluation of kidney function is not routinely done in most HIV public clinics. Identification of renal dysfunction is key in resource constrained settings because managing patients with end stage renal disease is costly. Method: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at an outpatient clinic in 2018 involving patients on TDF for at least 6 months who were 18 years or older. Patients with documented kidney disease and pregnancy were excluded. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the CKD-Epi formula. Renal dysfunction was defined as any of the following; either eGFR< 60 mL/min/1.73m2,or proteinuria of 2+ on urine dipstick, glycosuria with normal blood glucose. Electrolyte abnormalities were also documented. Results: We enrolled 278 participants. One hundred sixty nine (60.8%) were females, majority 234(84.2%) were < 50 years old, 205 (73.74%) were in WHO stage 1, most participants 271(97.5%) in addition to TDF were receiving lamivudine/efavirenz.

Recent reports estimate that more than 400,000 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) develop PCP each year globally. However, the timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation for HIV-infected patients with PCP is still controversial, and the benefits and risks of early initiation of ART are not completely clear. We thus designed this study in order to determine the optimal timing for ART initiation for HIV-positive patients with moderate to severe PCP. Methods: This study will be an open-label, multi-centre, prospective randomised controlled trial. A total of 200 subjects will be randomly assigned to an early ART initiation group (14 days after PCP diagnosis) and a deferred ART initiation group (>14 days after PCP diagnosis) at a 1:1 ratio. All subjects will be followed up for 48 weeks after starting ART. The primary endpoint is incidence of disease progression (including new or relapsing opportunistic infections and death) at week 48. The secondary endpoints are the changes in CD4 counts from baseline at weeks 12, 24 and 48; the degree of virological suppression (HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL) at weeks 24 and 48; the rate of development of PCP-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome; and adverse events over 48 weeks. Discussion: We hope that the results of this study will reveal the optimal timing for initiation of ART in HIV-infected patients with moderate to severe PCP.

All rights reserved.Bempedoic acid is a once-daily, oral therapy that can significantly reduce LDL-C levels, when added to other lipid-lowering therapies in patients with primary hyperlipidemia. Bempedoic acid is a prodrug that is converted to its active moiety primarily in the liver. This active form inhibits adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, two steps upstream from HMG-CoA reductase. The reduction of cholesterol synthesis results in LDL receptor upregulation and increased clearance of LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. Bempedoic acid has been investigated in the large phase 3 clinical development program CLEAR, alone, as add-on to statins and in a fixed-dose combination with ezetimibe. Bempedoic acid was studied in approximately 4,000 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), or who are at a high risk for ASCVD, and hypercholesterolemia, who continue to have elevated levels of LDL-C despite taking maximally-tolerated statins. In all these studies, bempedoic acid reduced the LDL-C-levels significant more effective than placebo or the lipid-lowering therapy. Bempedoic acid was well tolerated, with no severe adverse advents. In addition, a cardiovascular outcomes trial was designed to assess the effects of bempedoic acid on the occurrence of major cardiovascular events in patients with - or at high risk for - cardiovascular disease (CVD), and who are only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of a statin.;None;0.2;0.1;0.2;;;;;;

It has analgesic and muscle relaxant properties and is widely available as generics. This study is conducted to investigate the relative bioavailability and bioequivalence between one fixed dose paracetamol/orphenadrine combination test preparation and one fixed dose paracetamol/orphenadrine combination reference preparation in healthy volunteers under fasted condition for marketing authorization in Malaysia. Method: This is a single-center, single-dose, open-label, randomized, 2-treatment, 2-sequence and 2-period crossover study with a washout period of 7 days. Paracetamol/Orphenadrine tablets were administered after a 10-h fast. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected at scheduled time intervals prior to and up to 72 h after dosing. Blood samples were centrifuged, and separated plasma were kept frozen (- 15 °C to - 25 °C) until analysis. Plasma concentrations of orphenadrine and paracetamol were quantified using liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer using diphenhydramine as internal standard. The pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-, AUC0-t and Cmax were determined using plasma concentration time profile for both preparations. Bioequivalence was assessed according to the ASEAN guideline acceptance criteria for bioequivalence which is the 90% confidence intervals of AUC0-, AUC0-t and Cmax ratio must be within the range of 80.00-125.00%. Results: There were 28 healthy subjects enrolled, and 27 subjects completed this trial. There were no significant differences observed between the AUC0-, AUC0-t and Cmax of both test and reference preparations in fasted condition. The 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of AUC0-t (100.92-111.27%), AUC0- (96.94-108.08%) and Cmax (100.11-112.50%) for orphenadrine (n = 25); and AUC0-t (94.29-101.83%), AUC0- (94.77-101.68%) and Cmax (87.12-101.20%) for paracetamol (n = 27) for test preparation over reference preparation were all within acceptable bioequivalence range of 80.00-125.00%.

We analysed the location, phenotype, and proliferation of GC PCs by immunohistology comparing them to PCs in the other two locations. Most PCs in GCs were strongly positive for CD38, CD138, CD27, IRF4, and intracellular (ic) IgG. They often accumulated in the basal light zone, but could also be found scattered in the entire light zone. In addition, rows of PCs occurred at the surface of the GC bordering the mantle zone, i.e., in the outer zone, and at the surface of the dark zone. The latter cells were often continuous with PCs in the extrafollicular area. The vast majority of GC PCs were negative for Ki-67. Only a few Ki-67+ plasmablasts, predominantly icIgG+ or icIgM+, were found inside GCs. In certain GCs PCs accumulated around capillaries and the adjacent perikarya of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). Newly formed PCs might migrate from the basal to the superficial part of the light zone and then back to the dark zone surface to leave the GC. This guarantees an even distribution of secreted Ig for exchange with immune complexes on FDCs. The surface of the dark zone may also be an exit site for Ki-67+CD30+ B lymphoblasts, which seed perifollicular and extrafollicular sites. We speculate that these cells tend to downmodulate CD20 and activation-induced deaminase and further up-regulate CD30 when developing into pre-plasmablasts.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00418-020-01861-1;5.0;4.5;5.8;;32172287;;;;

The large-scale systems under consideration have multiple coupling links between neighboring subsystems, and all the links are considered to have different coupling weights and delays. A distributed fault detector and controller (FDC) module is designed to guarantee the exponential mean square stability of the overall closed-loop system along with a prescribed extended dissipative control performance and H fault detection performance. The gain parameters of the distributed fault detector and controller module are determined by using the cone complementarity linearization (CCL) algorithm.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential for cardiac repolarization following GLE + PIB administration in healthy adults. Methods: This placebo- and active-controlled, randomized, single-dose, 4-period, 4-sequence crossover study enrolled 48 healthy subjects. The doses of GLE 400 mg + PIB 120 mg were selected to provide exposures comparable to those with the doses that are therapeutic in the HCV-infected population, GLE 300 mg + PIB 120 mg. The doses of GLE 600 mg + PIB 240 mg were selected to provide supratherapeutic exposures without exceeding the exposures of the GLE + PIB maximal tolerated doses. Moxifloxacin 400 mg (active control/open label) was used for confirming the sensitivity of the ECG assay in detecting QTc prolongation. Time-matched plasma concentrations and triplicate ECGs were obtained on treatment days 1 and 1. The primary end point was time-matched, placebo-corrected, baseline-adjusted Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF). Pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic analyses characterized the relationship between GLE and PIB plasma concentrations and QTcF using a linear regression model and linear mixed-effects model. Findings from categorical analyses of ECG-interval data were also summarized. Tolerability was evaluated through adverse-events monitoring, physical examination including vital sign measurements, ECGs, and laboratory tests. Findings: A total of 48 subjects (22 women [46%], 26 men [54%]), were enrolled in the study, and 47 subjects completed all 4 periods. None of the subjects had a change from baseline in QTcF interval of >30 msec or an absolute QTcF interval of >450 msec. Peak QTcF values observed at 5 h postdose (Tmax) were 2.9 msec (upper 95% confidence limit, 4.9 msec) with the therapeutic dose and 3.1 msec (upper 95% confidence limit, 5.1 msec) with the supratherapeutic dose, with both upper 95% confidence limits well below the 10-msec threshold. Assay sensitivity was confirmed by peak QTcF in the positive control (12.8 ms at 2 h postdose). No statistically significant GLE or PIB concentration-dependent effects on QTcF were observed. Headache and skin irritation from ECG electrodes were the most commonly reported AEs. No clinically significant vital sign measurements, ECG findings, or laboratory measurements were observed. There were no patterns of T- and U-wave morphologic abnormalities. Implications: The fixed-dose combination regimen of GLE/PIB does not prolong the QTc interval.

A combination of such drugs may then have an overall better effect than the individual treatments which has to be verified by clinical trials. Several statistical methods have been explored that discuss the problem of comparing a fixed-dose combination therapy to each of its components. But an extension of these approaches to multiple dose combinations can be difficult and is not yet fully investigated. In this paper, we propose two approaches by which one can provide confirmatory assurance with familywise error rate control, that the combination of two drugs at differing doses is more effective than either component doses alone. These approaches involve multiple comparisons in multilevel factorial designs where the type 1 error can be controlled first, by bootstrapping tests, and second, by considering the least favorable null configurations for a family of union intersection tests. The main advantage of the new approaches is that their implementation is simple. The implementation of these new approaches is illustrated with a real data example from a blood pressure reduction trial. Extensive simulations are also conducted to evaluate the new approaches and benchmark them with existing ones. We also present an illustration of the relationship between the different approaches. We observed that the bootstrap provided some power advantages over the other approaches with the disadvantage that there may be some error rate inflation for small sample sizes.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0962280219871969;3.4;3.6;3.9;;31549566;;;;

Permeation of an API through the skin is controlled by adjusting drug concentration, formulation composition, and patch design. A bilayer, drug-in-adhesive TDDS design may allow improved modulation of the drug release profile by facilitating varying layer thicknesses and drug spatial distribution across each layer. We hypothesized that the co-release of two fixed-dose APIs from a bilayer TDDS could be controlled by modifying spatial distribution and layer thickness while maintaining the same overall formulation composition. Franz cell diffusion studies demonstrated that three different bilayer patch designs, with different spatial distribution of drug and layer thicknesses, could modulate drug permeation and be compared with a reference single-layer monolith patch design. Compared with the monolith, decreased opioid antagonist permeation while maintaining fentanyl permeation could be achieved using a bilayer design. In addition, modulation of the drug spatial distribution and individual layer thicknesses, control of each drug’s permeation could be independently achieved. Bilayer patch performance did not change over an 8-week period in accelerated stability storage conditions. In conclusion, modifying the patch design of a bilayer TDDS achieves an individualized permeation of each API while maintaining constant patch composition.;http://link.springer.com/10.1208/s12249-020-01682-4;3.5;3.1;4.0;;32500420;165;;;

Alternative combinations of direct-acting antiviral agents against early HCV infection need to be assessed. Patients and methods: In this pilot trial, MSM with recently acquired genotype 1 or 4 HCV infection were prospectively included and received 8 weeks of oral grazoprevir 100 mg and elbasvir 50 mg in a fixed-dose combination administered once daily. The primary endpoint was sustained virological response evaluated 12 weeks after the end of treatment (EOT) (SVR12). Secondary endpoints were the virological characterization of failures, the quality of life before, during and after treatment and the rate of reinfection. Results: In a 15 month period, 30 patients were enrolled, all of whom were MSM. Of the 29 patients completing follow-up, 28 (96%, 95% CI = 82%-99%) achieved SVR12. One patient interrupted follow-up (suicide) but had undetectable plasma HCV RNA at EOT. One patient with suboptimal adherence confirmed by plasma drug monitoring relapsed and developed NS3, NS5A and NS5B resistance-associated substitutions (V36M, M28V and S556G). The most common adverse events related to study drug were diarrhoea (n = 4, 13%), insomnia (n = 2, 7%) and fatigue (n = 2, 7%), although no patient discontinued treatment. No HIV RNA breakthrough was reported in the 28 patients with HIV coinfection. At Week 48, reinfection was diagnosed in three patients. Conclusions: Our data support the use of grazoprevir/elbasvir for immediate treatment against HCV in order to reduce HCV transmission in MSM.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/7/1961/5822569;8.7;7.7;8.3;;32306039;;;;

To assess the frequency of multiple congenital thoracic anomalies at a high-volume referral center; determine prenatal ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of these multifocal congenital lung lesions that may allow prenatal detection; and determine the most common distribution or site of origin. Methods: Database searches were performed from August 2008 to May 2019 for prenatally evaluated cases that had a final postnatal surgical diagnosis of 1 congenital lung lesion or a lung lesion associated with foregut duplication cyst (FDC). Lesion location, size, echotexture, and signal characteristics were assessed on prenatal imaging and correlated with postnatal computed tomographic angiography and surgical pathology. -Results: Of 539 neonates that underwent surgery for a thoracic lesion, 35 (6.5%) had 1 thoracic abnormality. Multiple discrete lung lesions were present in 19 cases, and a lung lesion associated with an FDC was present in 16. Multifocal lung lesions were bilateral in 3 cases; unilateral, multilobar in 12; and, unilobar multisegmental in 4.

Lesion combinations were CPAM-CPAM in 10 cases, CPAM-BPS in 5, CPAM-hybrid in 2, hybrid-hybrid in 1, and hybrid-BPS in 1. Of 5 unilateral, multifocal lung lesions, multifocality was prenatally established through identification of a band of normal intervening lung or intrinsic differences in lesion imaging features. Conclusions: Although less common, multiple thoracic abnormalities can be detected prenatally.

In addition, with the advent of future digital society, data have been gradually evolving into an effective virtual asset for sharing and usage. With the nature of the sensitivity, massiveness, fragmentation, and security of multiparty data computation in the IoT environment, we propose a secure data collaboration framework (FDC) based on federated deep-learning technology. The proposed framework can realize the secure collaboration of multiparty data computation on the premise that the data do not need to be transmitted out of their private data center. This framework is empowered by public data center, private data center, and the blockchain technology. The private data center is responsible for data governance, data registration, and data management. The public data center is used for multiparty secure computation. The blockchain paradigm is responsible for ensuring secure data usage and transmissions. A real IoT scenario is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8960348/;11.0;9.4;12.6;;;8960348;;;

It usually consists of several networks that share weights. The Siamese concept is topology-agnostic and can use any neural network as its backbone. The two most popular loss functions for training these networks are the triplet and contrastive loss functions. In this paper, we propose two novel loss functions, named Fisher Discriminant Triplet (FDT) and Fisher Discriminant Contrastive (FDC). The former uses anchor-neighbor-distant triplets while the latter utilizes pairs of anchor-neighbor and anchor-distant samples. The FDT and FDC loss functions are designed based on the statistical formulation of the Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA), which is a linear subspace learning method. Our experiments on the MNIST and two challenging and publicly available histopathology datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed loss functions.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9206833/;1.7;1.6;1.6;;;9206833;;true;9781728169262

Treating KS in pregnancy must balance both the well-being of the mother with the health of the fetus, yet data and recommendations on the best treatment approach for KS during pregnancy are limited. Without effective treatment, which can be difficult to obtain in low income countries (LICs), the mother and infant are at risk for poor outcomes. A successful case report is used as teaching example, followed by a detailed review of the literature that culminates in recommendations for treating KS during pregnancy among HIV-positive women in LICs. A 31-year-old HIV-positive woman presented for care in April 2016 at 28 weeks gestation with extensive KS skin lesions, KS lymphadenopathy, and a large oropharynx KS lesion causing partial airway obstruction. She had initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) months prior and was virally suppressed, suggesting KS-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Due to the severity of KS and her third trimester status, combination chemotherapy was initiated using bleomycin, vincristine, and doxorubicin followed by maintenance therapy with paclitaxel. She showed remarkable response to the chemotherapy and had a normal vaginal delivery of a healthy baby at full term. Full clinical remission was achieved, and her baby was HIV-negative with no negative health effects of the KS or the chemotherapy. Review of the sparse existing literature demonstrates the importance, safety, and effectiveness of treating KS during pregnancy. We offer simple adaptable treatment recommendations for use in treating HIV-positive women with KS during pregnancy in LICs. Life-threatening KS can be treated using chemotherapy and ART in resource-limited settings, allowing for good outcomes in mother and infant. While monotherapy with liposomal doxorubicin or paclitaxel is preferred, these are often not available in LICs. As alternatives, bleomycin, vincristine, and doxorubicin can be safely used during the second and/or third trimesters for treating KS. Following a simple treatment approach can be an effective way to treat KS in pregnancy for pregnant women living with HIV in an LIC setting.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956462420920160;2.5;2.5;2.7;;32493141;;;;

One strategy proposes to eliminate these viral reservoirs by pharmacologically reactivating the latently infected T cells. We show here that a 4-deoxyphorbol ester derivative isolated from Euphorbia amygdaloides ssp. semiperfoliata, 4-dPE A, reactivates HIV-1 from latency and could potentially contribute to decrease the viral reservoir. 4-dPE A shows two effects in the HIV replication cycle, infection inhibition and HIV transactivation, similarly to other phorboids PKC agonists such PMA and prostratin and to other diterpene esters such SJ23B. Our data suggest 4-dPE A is non-tumorigenic, unlike the related compound PMA. As the compounds are highly similar, the lack of tumorigenicity by 4-dPE A could be due to the lack of a long side lipophilic chain that is present in PMA. 4-dPE activates HIV transcription at nanomolar concentrations, lower than the concentration needed by other latency reversing agents (LRAs) such as prostratin and similar to bryostatin. PKC/MEK activation is required for the transcriptional activity, and thus, anti-latency activity of 4-dPE A. However, CD4, CXCR4 and CCR5 receptors down-regulation effect seems to be independent of PCK/MEK, suggesting the existence of at least two different targets for 4-dPE A. Furthermore, NF-b transcription factor is involved in 4-dPE HIV reactivation, as previously shown for other PKCs agonists. We also studied the effects of 4-dPE A in combination with other LRAs. When 4-dPE A was combined with another PKC agonists such as prostratin an antagonic effect was achieved, while, when combined with an HDAC inhibitor such as vorinostat, a strong synergistic effect was obtained. Interestingly, the latency reversing effect of the combination was synergistically diminishing the EC50 value but also increasing the efficacy showed by the drugs alone. In addition, combinations of 4-dPE A with antiretroviral drugs as CCR5 antagonist, NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs, showed a consistent synergistic effect, suggesting that the combination would not interefer with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Finally, 4-dPE A induced latent HIV reactivation in CD4 + T cells of infected patients under ART at similar levels than the tumorigenic phorbol derivative PMA, showing a clear reactivation effect. In summary, we describe here the mechanism of action of a new potent deoxyphorbol derivative as a latency reversing agent candidate to decrease the size of HIV reservoirs.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006295220301659;8.4;6.2;7.5;S0006295220301659;32224142;113937;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006295220301659;;

Methods: Both mixtures were prepared by direct mixing in different proportions and investigated by visual inspection (color, texture, and odor and gel uniformity), pH and Viscosity Possible chemical interactions were studied by tracing IR peaks for each drug under study. It is a randomized, double-blind and controlled clinical pilot with parallel group it was designed to last one week after operation and performed on 160 patients aged from 18-60 years old with specified inclusion criteria. Results: All the prepared formulations were uniform under visual inspection, pH, viscosity values and the drugs had normal IR spectrum after mixing. The mean decrement in the pain severity according to (VAS ruler) seems greater in DLD group (8.66 ± 1.09) compared with LD gel group (3.92 ±1.334). After treatment for 6 days postoperatively, pain reduction is significantly greater in the group applied DLD (6.463 ± 2.39) than in the LD group (4.055 ± 3.11). AUC exhibit higher effectiveness for DLD than for LD group for 3 and 6 days postoperatively. Conclusion: The new topical combination of diltiazem gel, diclofenac gel and lidocaine gel DLD is recognized to be more effective than application of diclofenac and lidocaine LD in the 1st three post-operative days and all over the 1st week next hemorrhoidectomy.;None;0.2;0.3;0.8;;;;;;

But concurrent infections pose a diagnostic challenge owing to similar clinical features. Data suggests a high prevalence of such concurrent infections in developing countries but limited diagnostic modalities especially in resource constraint setup limits accurate diagnosis. At our centre we came across 6 newly diagnosed PTB patients among HIV infected ones had persistent shortness of breath (SOB) and hypoxia despite starting anti-tuberculous treatment (ATT). We excluded concomitant bacterial pneumonia by imaging, sputum examination and blood culture. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was estimated and hypoxia by arterial blood gas (ABG). We found all 6 patients had elevated serum LDH, hypoxia and imaging suggestive of PJP were offered sputum for Geisma stain and standard treatment for PJP in form of Bactrim-double strength and steroid. 1 patient had PJ cysts in sputum. 5 patient's classical radiologic findings in form of ground glass opacities in lower lobes along with bilateral infiltrates and 1 had honeycombing. Serum LDH was elevated all 6 subjects. 5 were newly diagnosed HIV and 4 had CD4 count below 50 cells/mm3 and 2 had below 200 cells/mm3.1 patient had developed bilateral pneumothorax as complication. 4 patients responded to treatment and 2 (33.3%) died of respiratory failure during treatment. We were able to diagnose only severe PJP cases as concurrent infection with PTB as there was no availability of broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) as well as direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) test for PJ detection. A high index of suspicion for PJP even in PTB patients with low CD4 count will guide to appropriate therapy for both infections and eventually reduces morbidity and mortality.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0019570719301982;0.5;0.8;1.0;S0019570719301982;32825873;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0019570719301982;;

The primary aims of this study were to assess the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on the risk of mortality and incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis among adults initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods: This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D3 supplementation among adults living with HIV who initiated ART and had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of less than 30 ng/mL at four large HIV care and treatment centres in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years, pregnant at the time of randomisation, or were enrolled in any other clinical trial. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either weekly oral 50 000 IU vitamin D3 supplements (cholecalciferol) for the first month of ART followed by daily 2000 IU vitamin D3 supplements or a matching weekly and daily placebo regimen. The randomisation list was computer-generated by a non-study statistician with sequence blocks of ten that were stratified by study clinic. Complete allocation concealment was ensured and patients, field team, and investigators were masked to group assignment. The trial follow-up duration was 1 year and the primary efficacy outcomes were death and incident pulmonary tuberculosis. An intention-to-treat analysis was followed for all-cause mortality; participants diagnosed with or receiving treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis at randomisation, or suspected to have tuberculosis at randomisation and who later had that diagnosis confirmed, were excluded from analyses of pulmonary tuberculosis incidence. Safety was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01798680, and is completed. Findings: Between Feb 24, 2014, and Feb 24, 2017, 6250 adults initiating ART had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D screening, 4000 of whom were enrolled in the trial and followed up for 1 year (follow-up of all participants was completed on March 7, 2018). 2001 patients were randomly assigned to the vitamin D3 supplementation group, and 1999 to the placebo group. 415 deaths were recorded: 211 in the vitamin D3 group and 204 in the placebo group. Among all randomly assigned participants, there was no overall effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on the risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1·04, 95% CI 0·85–1·25; p=0·73). There was also no difference in the overall incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis between the vitamin D3 (50 events in 1812 patients analysed) and placebo groups (64 events in 1827 patients; HR 0·78, 0·54–1·13; p=0·19). The vitamin D3 regimen did not increase the risk of hypercalcaemia (three events in the vitamin D3 group and two events in the placebo group; relative risk 1·25, 95% CI 0·43–3·66; Fisher's exact p=1·00). 101 hospital admissions were reported in the vitamin D3 group and 94 in the placebo group (incidence rate ratio 1·06, 95% CI 0·80–1·41; p=0·66). Interpretation: Additional research is needed before vitamin D3 supplementation should be considered for implementation in HIV care and treatment programmes for the prevention of pulmonary tuberculosis or mortality.

However, the characteristics of anti-HIV antibody response in the subjects who are treated during chronic HIV-1 infection (CHI) have not yet been fully investigated. Methods: Different anti-HIV antibodies were longitudinally quantified and analyzed in 81 CHI adults under ART. The factors associated with antibody decline were evaluated by binary logistic regression analysis. Results: ART led to 36.0% (27/75) and 52.1% (38/73) of the patients whose anti-HIV levels reduced by more than 75% of the baseline levels at 12 and 24 months post-ART, respectively. The reduction of anti-HIV antibodies correlated with the decline of HIV-1 viral load with correlation coefficients in the range 0.5560.848 or R2 value of 0.5760.873 (P < 0.001). However, no negative detection of anti-HIV antibody was observed at 24 months post-ART. The time from HIV-1 diagnosis to ART initiation and the baseline anti-HIV levels were the key factors associated with quick decline of anti-HIV antibodies during ART. Conclusions: ART-induced kinetics of anti-HIV antibody response was different among the subjects with AHI and CHI. Misdiagnosis of HIV-1 infection may not be a serious issue in HIV-1 chronically infected subjects under ART, and could ideally be avoided by using multiple HIV-1 antigens for screening purposes.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1386653220301566;5.7;6.0;5.9;S1386653220301566;32417676;104414;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1386653220301566;;

ADR12 to any drug among PLHIV with VL 1000 copies/mL was 86.1% (48.9%-97.6%); 67.1% (37.4%-87.5%) had HIVDR to both NNRTIs and NRTIs, and 3.8% (0.5%-25.2%) to PIs. ADR48 was 92.0% (86.8%-95.3%) to any drug; 78.1% (66.6%-86.5%) to both NNRTIs and NRTIs, and 7.3% (1.8%-25.1%) to PIs. Conclusions: The high prevalence of NNRTI pre-treatment HIVDR observed in Honduras warrants consideration of non-NNRTI-based first-line regimens for ART initiation. Programmatic improvements in HIVDR monitoring and adherence support may also be considered.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/7/1932/5821490;8.7;7.7;8.3;;32303063;;;;

Journal of the International AIDS Society published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of International AIDS SocietyIntroduction: As integrase inhibitors become available in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), they offer the potential to expand extremely limited treatment options available to children and adolescents. In LMICs, only small numbers have used raltegravir, primarily as part of third-line regimens. Using data from the IeDEA global consortium, we aimed to describe the characteristics of children on raltegravir-containing regimens and their outcomes. Methods: We included data from 1994 to 2017 from children (age <18 years), from East and Southern Africa, Asia and South America, who received cART regimens containing raltegravir for 90 days. We describe their characteristics at raltegravir start, and their immunological and virological outcomes. Results and discussion: In total, 62 children were included, with median age at raltegravir initiation of 14.3 years (IQR 11.2 to 15.8) and median CD4 count of 276 cells/µL (IQR 68 to 494). Among 40 (65%) with drug resistance testing prior to raltegravir, 71% were resistant to at least one protease inhibitor (PI), and 32% had high-level resistance to at least one drug class. Most (n = 50; 81%) received raltegravir as part of third-line cART following PI-based regimens, and were on regimens containing four or more drugs (n = 47, 76%). By database closure, median duration on raltegravir was 2.0 years (IQR 0.8 to 3.0), 1 (1.6%) patient had died, 6 (9.7%) were lost to follow-up and 21 (34%) had discontinued raltegravir. Among 15 patients reporting reasons for stopping raltegravir, six discontinued because it was no longer available. Within one year of starting raltegravir, among 53 patients with VL measures, 40 (75%) had VL < 1000 copies/mL, and among 54 with a reported CD4 count, 45 (83%) and 36 (67%) were 350 and 500 cells/µL, respectively, with median CD4 count increasing to 517.5 cells/µL (IQR 288 to 810). Conclusions: Among children in LMICs, the initial use of raltegravir has been primarily for post PI-based cART. We found good virological and immunological outcomes despite frequent prior triple-class failure and high levels of drug resistance. Both access to raltegravir and long-term adherence to regimens with large pill-burdens remain challenging. Policies which promote earlier access to new drugs and simplify daily regimens for children and adolescents in LMICs are needed.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jia2.25580;5.5;6.7;7.1;;32722897;e25580;;;

The proposed FDC is composed of a pair of coupled lines instead transmission line of a directional coupler. This coupled lines resonator increases the design parameters by which even/odd mode phase velocity can be compensated to improve the directivity and coupling level. The coupling enhancement can be explained by analyzing the even mode and odd mode circuit of the proposed coupler. A prototype of the proposed coupler is designed which provides a high directivity of 44 dB for 6 dB coupling level at 1 GHz frequency. The proposed coupler is designed, fabricated, and tested.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mmce.22224;1.8;2.0;1.9;;;e22224;;;

Objective: To explore the effectiveness and safety, in particular NP-AEs, of DTG/ABC/3TC in a cohort of HIV-1 adult infected patients. Pill burden, adherence to this STR, and the impact of switching on costs were also evaluated. Methods: This was an observational, retrospective study. The study population included antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive and treatment-experienced (TE) patients who started DTG/ABC/3TC between February 1, 2016, and October 31, 2016. Effectiveness and safety were analyzed at week 48 (W48) by intention-to-treat analysis. The Cox regression model was used to investigate predictors of DTG/ABC/3TC discontinuation. Results: A total of 253 patients were included (44 ART naïve, 209 TE). At W48, the proportion of patients with virological suppression was 72.7% (95% CI = 58.4-87.0) in ART-naive patients, 85.6% (95% CI = 80.3-90.9) in previously suppressed TE patients, and 86.4% (95% CI = 65.1-97.1) in previously not suppressed TE patients. The rate of protocol-defined virological failure was 4.3%. The incidence of AEs was higher in the subgroup of ART-naive patients (56.1% vs 39.0%), with a rate of interruptions for this reason of 13.6% and 7.6%, respectively. The incidence of NP-AEs was 20.6%, with 3.9% of patients requiring discontinuation. Patients who had switched from a raltegravir-containing regimen discontinued DTG/ABC/3TC because of AEs more frequently (relative risk = 2.83; 95% CI = 1.04-7.72; P = 0.041) in the multivariate analysis. After switching to DTG/ABC/3TC, the median pill burden was reduced from 3 to 1 and the proportion of patients with an adherence <90%, from 20.1% to 12.0%. The annual per-patient ART costs increased by €48 (0.6% increase). Conclusion and Relevance: DTG/ABC/3TC is an effective strategy as first-line and switching ART. Our data suggest a worse tolerance in ART-naive patients, although the rate of discontinuation resulting from NP-AEs was relatively low. In the short-term, the adherence was slightly improved without significant changes in costs.";http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1060028019896638;5.7;5.2;4.3;;31910643;;;;

HIV Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British HIV AssociationObjectives: Socio-economic factors and lifestyle are known to differ across geographies and populations, which may result in distinct risk profiles for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study assessed carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), a proxy for CVD, and its determinants in two groups of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in two different settings in South Africa. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted comparing data from the Ndlovu Cohort Study in the Limpopo Province (group 1) and from three clinical trials in Johannesburg (group 2). The association between demographics, conventional CVD risk factors, HIV-related factors and CIMT in groups 1 and 2 was analysed with two separate multivariable linear regression models. Results: Group 1 consisted of 826 participants (mean age 42.2 years) and mean (± standard deviation) CIMT was 0.626 ± 0.128 mm. In this group, sex, age, body mass index (BMI), cholesterol, glucose and antiretroviral therapy (ART) duration ( = 0.011 mm per 5 years; P = 0.02) were associated with higher CIMT. There were positive interactions between age and ART duration and age and cholesterol. Group 2 consisted of 382 participants (mean age 39.5 years) and mean (± standard deviation) CIMT was 0.560 ± 0.092 mm. In this group, only sex, education level, BMI and cholesterol were associated with higher CIMT, albeit with weaker associations than in group 1. Conclusions: Conventional CVD risk factors were the main drivers of CIMT. The impact of some of these risk factors appeared to increase with age. Differences in sample size, age and viral suppression might explain why an effect of ART was observed in group 1 but not in group 2.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hiv.12831;5.6;5.3;5.8;;31852030;;;;

Distal sensory peripheral neuropathy (DSPN) is a complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We estimate DSPN prevalence in 7 resource-limited settings (RLSs) for combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-naive people living with HIV (PLWH) compared with matched participants not living with HIV and in PLWH virally suppressed on 1 of 3 cART regimens. Methods. PLWH with a CD4+ count <300 cells/mm3 underwent standardized neurological examination and functional status assessments before and every 24 weeks after starting cART. Matched individuals not living with HIV underwent the same examinations once. Associations between covariates with DSPN at entry were assessed using the ?2 test, and virally suppressed PLWH were assessed using generalized estimating equations. Results. Before initiating cART, 21.3% of PLWH had DSPN compared with 8.5% of people not living with HIV (n = 2400; ?2(df = 1) = 96.5; P <.00001). PLWH with DSPN were more likely to report inability to work [?2(df = 1) = 10.6; P =.001] and depression [?2(df = 1) = 8.9; P =.003] than PLWH without DSPN. Overall prevalence of DSPN among those virally suppressed on cART decreased: 20.3%, week 48; 15.3%, week 144; and 10.3%, week 192. Incident DSPN was seen in 127 PLWH. Longitudinally, DSPN was more likely in older individuals (P <.001) and PLWH with less education (P =.03). There was no significant association between cART regimen and DSPN. Conclusions. Although the prevalence of DSPN decreased following cART initiation in PLWH, further research could identify strategies to prevent or ameliorate residual DSPN after initiating cART in RLSs.";https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/1/158/5547098;14.0;13.8;12.5;;31630166;;;;

Despite there being several potential underlying mechanisms, plasma protein displacement has been suggested. The aim of this study was to assess plasma concentrations of several antiretrovirals when administered with or without valproic acid. Methods: We performed a therapeutic drug monitoring registry analysis and identified patients concomitantly taking antiretrovirals and valproic acid and without clinical affecting conditions or interacting drugs. Results: One hundred and thirty-four patients were identified. Median (IQR) age and BMI were 49.7 years (45-56) and 23.4 kg/m2 (20.8-26.3) and 78 were male (58.2%). Despite small groups, we observed no major effect on antiretroviral exposure, even when considering highly protein-bound compounds (such as etravirine), with the exception of dolutegravir trough concentrations [median (IQR) = 132 ng/mL (62-227) in individuals on valproic acid versus 760 ng/mL (333-1407) in those not receiving valproic acid]. Conclusions: Valproic acid does not have a major effect on antiretrovirals other than dolutegravir. The mechanism of this unexpected drug-drug interaction may be the combination of protein displacement, reduced absorption and CYP3A4 induction.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/7/1969/5811612;8.7;7.7;8.3;;32211890;;;;

In view of this, a case-based questionnaire survey was conducted to analyze the clinical utility of multiple strengths of glimepiride and metformin fixed dose combination in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: The case-based questionnaire survey was conducted with 174 health care professionals across India to assess the use of glimepiride and metformin fixed dose combination according to age, duration of diabetes, body mass index (BMI), diabetes complications, concomitant medications like insulin, and statin. Results: Overall, data from 2248 patients taking multiple strengths of glimepiride and metformin fixed dose combination were analyzed. All the doses were prescribed across all the age groups and irrespective of duration of diabetes. Overall, 1429 diabetes patients had body mass index (BMI) 25 kg/m2, among which 1176 (81.6%) patients were receiving combination of glimepiride 1 or 2 mg and metformin 500 or 850 or 1000 mg. Glimepiride and metformin fixed dose combinations were among the preferred choices in various complications like neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, peripheral vascular disease, diabetic foot and cardiovascular disease. Insulin and statins were co-prescribed in 17.3% and 28.8% patients, respectively. Hypoglycemic episodes were reported in only a minority of patients, even with higher doses of glimepiride and metformin fixed dose combinations. Conclusion: Multiple strengths of glimepiride and metformin fixed dose combinations are beneficial in T2DM, irrespective of age, duration of diabetes, BMI, diabetes complications, use of concomitant medications such as insulin and statin. Glimepiride and metformin fixed dose combinations were not associated with a significant risk of hypoglycemia.;None;0.7;0.6;0.7;;32602682;;;;

Isoniazid is used as a first-line drug to treat tuberculosis infection. However, variability in isoniazid pharmacokinetics can result in hepatotoxicity or treatment failure. Determination of clinical factors affecting isoniazid pharmacokinetics and metabolic pathways in HIV co-infected patients is therefore critical. Plasma levels of isoniazid, acetyl-isoniazid, and isonicotinic acid from 63 patients co-infected with tuberculosis and HIV were analyzed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry followed by nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Patients were genotyped to determine acetylator status. Patients were either on concomitant efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy or HIV treatment naïve. Clearances of isoniazid were 1.3-fold and 2.3-fold higher in intermediate and rapid acetylators, respectively, compared with slow acetylators. Patients on concomitant efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy had 64% and 80% higher population predicted clearances of acetyl-isoniazid and isonicotinic acid, respectively, compared with patients who were HIV treatment naïve. Both sex and CD4 cell count affected the bioavailability of isoniazid.

Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.Background. Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that involve antiretrovirals (ARVs) tend to cause harm if unrecognized, especially in the context of comorbidity and polypharmacy. Methods. A linkage was established between the drug dispensing registry of Madrid and the Liverpool human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) DDI database (January 2017-June 2017). Polypharmacy was defined as the use of 5 non-HIV medications, and DDIs were classified by a traffic-light ranking for severity. Results. A total of 22 945 people living with HIV (PLWH) and 6 613 506 individuals without HIV had received medications. ARV regimens were predominantly based on integrase inhibitors (51.96%). Polypharmacy was higher in PLWH (32.94%) than individuals without HIV (22.16%; P <.001); this difference was consistently observed across all age strata except for individuals 75 years. Polypharmacy was more common in women than men in both PLWH and individuals without HIV. The prevalence of contraindicated combinations involving ARVs was 3.18%. Comedications containing corticosteroids, quetiapine, or antithrombotic agents were associated with the highest risk for red-flag DDI, and the use of raltegravir- or dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy was associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.72 (95% confidence interval,.60-.88; P =.001) for red-flag DDI. Conclusions. Polypharmacy was more frequent among PLWH across all age groups except those aged 75 years and was more common in women. The detection of contraindicated medications in PLWH suggests a likely disconnect between hospital and community prescriptions. Switching to alternative unboosted integrase regimens should be considered for patients with risk of harm from DDIs.";https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/2/353/5552008;14.0;13.8;12.5;;31428770;;;;

This study assessed the real-world effectiveness and safety of once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Tiotropium/Formoterol/Ciclesonide (TFC) (18 mcg/12 mcg/400 mcg) via dry powder inhaler (DPI) or metered dose inhaler (MDI) in patients with COPD. Patients and methods: In this 24-week, open-label, prospective, non-comparative, multicentre, real-world study, COPD patients requiring triple therapy as judged by their physician, were enrolled. The primary endpoint was mean change from baseline in pre-dose Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s (FEV1) at week 24. Pre and post-dose (30 min) FEV1, Forced Vital capacity (FVC), COPD Assessment Test (CAT), modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) score and safety were also evaluated. A post-hoc analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the triple drug combination among smoker and non-smoker COPD patients. Results: Out of the 297 patients enrolled [mean age 61 ± 10 years; 84.8% males; 55.2% smokers and post-dose FEV1 (% predicted) 39 ± 16%], 253 completed the study. Mean change in pre-dose FEV1 from baseline to week 24 increased significantly after administering the triple drug combination [580 ± 600 mL, 95% CI (510, 650 mL), p < 0.0001]. The increase in the pre-dose FEV1 was significant at all time points (p < 0.0001). Similar improvements were seen in pre-dose FVC, post-dose FEV1 and post-dose FVC across all time points. CAT scores and the proportion of patients with improved mMRC score improved at all visits. The post-hoc analysis showed that TFC significantly increased pre-dose FEV1 both among smokers [mean change 200 ± 430 mL, 95% CI (130, 270 mL), p < 0.0001] as well as non-smokers [990 ± 470 mL, 95% CI (900, 1070 mL), p < 0.0001] at week 24. This difference was significant from week 12 onwards. Mean change in pre and post-dose FEV1 and FVC was significant across all visits between the two groups. At week 24, CAT score reduced significantly from baseline (overall: -6.6 ± 6.07; smokers: -5.17 + 6.96; non-smokers: 8.06 ± 4.44; all p < 0.0001). The mean difference between the two groups was 2.88 (p < 0.0001) at week 24. TFC was well tolerated. Conclusion: In this real world, multicentre study in India, TFC significantly improved lung function, symptoms and quality of life among all patients with COPD, but the effect was more pronounced among non-smoker COPD patients.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S109455392030136X;4.9;4.9;4.3;S109455392030136X;32777289;101932;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S109455392030136X;;

Methods: Patients (aged 18 years), symptomatic (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ]-7 1.5) despite treatment with long-acting 2-agonist/inhaled corticosteroid medium- or high-dose, received IND/GLY/MF high- (150/50/160 g) or medium-dose (150/50/80 g) o.d. or SAL/FLU high-dose (50/500 g) b.i.d.+Tio 5 g o.d. for 24 weeks. The primary objective was to confirm the non-inferiority of either dose of IND/GLY/MF to SAL/FLU high dose + TIO in terms of Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ). Additional endpoints: ACQ-7, lung function, health status (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]), exacerbations, and safety after 24 weeks. Results: IND/GLY/MF high- and medium-dose met the primary endpoint, confirming non-inferiority to SAL/FLU high dose + TIO for AQLQ (least square mean treatment difference []: 0.073 and 0.038, respectively; both p < 0.001).

This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USAThe objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of hemodialysis (HD) on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of meropenem/vaborbactam, an approved beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination, and provide the rationale for the recommended timing of meropenem/vaborbactam administration relative to HD in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Population PK models were developed separately for meropenem and vaborbactam in subjects with normal renal function and different degrees of renal impairment, including those receiving HD. Simulations were performed to evaluate the exposure of meropenem and vaborbactam in ESRD patients who received a fixed dose of 0.5 g/0.5 g meropenem/vaborbactam every 12 hours as a 3-hour intravenous infusion under various drug administration schedules relative to HD. The probability of target attainment (PTA) analyses were conducted with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets of meropenem and vaborbactam. Simulations showed that HD reduces the accumulation of vaborbactam, but the exposure of vaborbactam is still above the PK/PD target regardless of whether meropenem/vaborbactam is administered predialysis or postdialysis. For meropenem, drug infusion completed right prior to initiation of HD may substantially reduce exposure leading to poor PTA results. In contrast, drug infusion completed at least 2 hours prior to initiation of HD is not predicted to result in efficacy loss based on PTA analysis. The results of simulation indicate that meropenem/vaborbactam infusion completed at least 2 hours prior to initiation of HD or administered immediately after the end of HD can avoid potential efficacy loss in ESRD patients.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcph.1595;5.4;5.4;5.2;;32149406;;;;

Methods: Prezcobix/Rezolsta is a fixed-dose combination of 800 mg of the HIV protease inhibitor darunavir (DRV) and 150 mg cobicistat, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection. There are currently no definitive data on the safety and efficacy of DRV/cobicistat for the treatment of COVID-19. The in vitro antiviral activity of darunavir against a clinical isolate from a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 was assessed. Results: DRV showed no antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 at clinically relevant concentrations (EC50 > 100 M). Remdesivir, used as a positive control, demonstrated potent antiviral activity (EC50 = 0.38 M).

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Two green analytical approaches have been developed for the analysis of antimalarial fixed dose tablets of artemether and lumefantrine for quality control. The first approach consisted of investigating the qualitative performance of a low-cost handheld near-infrared spectrometer in combination with the principal component analysis as an exploratory tool to identify trends, similarities, and differences between pharmaceutical samples, before applying the data driven soft independent modeling of class analogy (DD-SIMCA) as a one-class classifier for proper drug falsification detection with 100% of both sensitivity and specificity in the studied cases. Despite its limited spectral range and low resolution, the handheld device allowed detecting falsified drugs with no active pharmaceutical ingredient and identifying specifically a pharmaceutical tablet brand name. The second approach was the quantitative analysis based on the green and fast RP-HPLC technique using ethanol as a green organic solvent and acetic acid as a green pH modifier. The optimal separation was achieved in 7 min using a mobile phase composed of ethanol 96% and 10 mM of acetic acid pH 3.35 (63:37, v/v). The developed method was validated according to the total error approach based on an accuracy profile, was applied to the analysis of tablets, and allowed confirming falsified drugs detected by spectroscopy.;https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/25/15/3397;4.5;4.1;4.1;;32727052;3397;;;

These studies further evaluated the chosen FDC IBU/APAP 250/500 mg formulation.Materials and Methods:Two phase 3 dental pain studies enrolled healthy young patients with moderate pain after 3 third molar extractions who received single-dose FDC IBU/APAP 250/500 mg, IBU 250 mg, APAP 650 mg, or placebo evaluated over 12 hours (study 1) or multiple-dose FDC or placebo every 8 hours, evaluated over 48 hours (study 2). Time-weighted sum of pain intensity differences over 8 (SPID[11]0-8) and 24 (SPID[11]0-24) hours were primary outcomes, respectively. Time to meaningful pain relief and duration of pain relief were assessed; tolerability was evaluated by adverse events.Results:Five hundred sixty-eight patients were randomized in study 1; 123 in study 2. Study 1: SPID[11]0-8 favored FDC significantly over placebo, IBU, and APAP (P<0.001, P=0.008, and P<0.001, respectively); study 2: SPID[11]0-24 significantly favored FDC over placebo (P<0.001), with sustained efficacy during multiple dosing. Time to meaningful pain relief occurred within 1 hour; pain relief duration was >8 hours in both studies. Adverse event rates were lowest with the FDC.Discussion:FDC IBU/APAP 250/500 mg provides superior analgesic efficacy to individual monocomponents (IBU 250 mg and APAP 650 mg), a rapid onset of action, >8-hour duration of pain relief, is generally well tolerated, and may provide an additional nonopioid treatment option for acute pain.";https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/AJP.0000000000000828;5.8;5.9;5.3;;32271183;;;;

This study aimed at evaluating the influence of ART on HCV-VL and liver fibrosis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV-coinfected patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients followed at a tertiary university hospital. Results: In total, 143 patients were included. In 61 patients, ART initiation was accompanied by an increase in HCV-VL and a decrease in HIV viral load (HIV-VL), whereas ART suspension led to a decrease in HCV-VL and an increase in HIV-VL. Among the 55 HIV-suppressed patients who switched to a raltegravir (RAL)-containing regimen, median HCV-VL levels decreased significantly, while switching to a rilpivirine-containing regimen did not yield a significant reduction. Discussion: If the-Treatment of chronic hepatitis starts before ART, ART initiation should be delayed as much as possible. If ART has been started, it is advisable to wait 1 year before initiating chronic hepatitis treatment. RAL as the third agent in an ART regimen could be beneficial in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, in comparison to other antiretroviral drugs. Conclusion: The start and the suspension of ART significantly interferes with HCV-VL in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients.;https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/503631;2.6;1.9;1.9;;31775148;;;;

To determine whether differential rates of clonal proliferation or HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) pressure shape the provirus landscape, we performed an intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) and obtained 661 near-full-length provirus sequences from 8 individuals with suppressed viral loads on ART at time points 7 years apart. We observed slow decay of intact proviruses but no changes in the proportions of various types of defective proviruses. The proportion of intact proviruses in expanded clones was similar to that of defective proviruses in clones. Intact proviruses observed in clones did not have more escaped CTL epitopes than intact proviruses observed as singlets. Concordantly, total proviruses at later time points or observed in clones were not enriched in escaped or unrecognized epitopes. Three individuals with natural control of HIV-1 infection (controllers) on ART, included because controllers have strong HIV-1-specific CTL responses, had a smaller proportion of intact proviruses but a distribution of defective provirus types and escaped or unrecognized epitopes similar to that of the other individuals. This work suggests that CTL selection does not significantly check clonal proliferation of infected cells or greatly alter the provirus landscape in people on ART.;https://www.jci.org/articles/view/135953;21.2;19.0;17.0;;32191639;;;;

We sequenced plasma viral RNA from 74 adolescents and young adults (16-24 years) failing first-line ART at Newlands Clinic, Zimbabwe between October 2015 and December 2016. We evaluated first-line nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) susceptibility scores to first- A nd second-line regimens. Boosted protease inhibitor (bPI)-based ART was provided and viral load (VL) monitored for =48 weeks. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate factors associated with VS on second-line regimens, defined as VL <1,000 copies/mL (VS1,000) or <50 copies/mL (VS50). The 74 participants on first-line ART had a median [interquartile range (IQR)] age of 18 (16-21) years and 42 (57%) were female. The mean (±standard deviation) duration on ART was 5.5 (±3.06) years and the median (IQR) log10 VL was 4.26 (3.78-4.83) copies/mL. After switching to a second-line PI regimen, 88% suppressed to <1,000 copies/mL and 76% to <50 copies/mL at =48 weeks. A new NRTI was associated with increased VS50 (p = .031). These 74 adolescents and young adults failing first-line ART demonstrated high levels (97%) of DRMs, despite enhanced adherence counseling. Switching to new NRTIs in second-line improved VS. With the widespread adoption of generic dolutegravir, lamivudine and tenofovir combinations in Africa, genotyping to determine NRTI susceptibility, may be warranted.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2019.0232;3.3;3.2;3.4;;32138527;;;;

Drug-drug interactions(DDIs) will become an ever-increasing issue. However, little is known about this important issue in Chinese PLWH. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of DDIs among PLWH in China. Methods: Chinese PLWH aged 18 years were enrolled prospectively from October 2018 to April 2019 and after informed consent was obtained, they were ask to fill out a questionnaire about comorbidity and co-medications. Potential DDIs were identified using the University of Liverpool HIV Drug Interaction Checker. Results: A total of 1804 questionnaires were included. Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) that most frequently were prescribed were lamivudine (96.18%), efavirenz(64.64%) and tenofovir(60.62%). 16.96% of the participations reported current co-infection with HIV and14.69% reported NCDs. 263(14.57%) participations reported they had used co-medications in the past six months while 186(10.31%) reported they were taking co-medications. Age50 years (p < 0.001), living in developed areas(p < 0.001) and lower CD4 cell count(p = 0.045) were independently associated with the use of co-medications. Potential DDIs were identified in 54 (19.15%) persons using co-medications. Age50 [OR = 2.272(1.241–4.158)], PLWH with NCDs[OR = 2.889(1.509–5.532)] and usage of protease inhibitors[OR = 2.538(1.250–5.156)] were independently associated with the potential DDIs. Conclusion: The prevalence of the use of co-medications and potential DDIs among Chinese PLWH are low. Older age, NCDs and use of PIs were risk factors for the potential of developing DDIs. With the aging of PLWH, co-medications and DDIs in China warrants more attention.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1341321X20301276;3.2;2.9;2.8;S1341321X20301276;32354599;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1341321X20301276;;

Objective: To investigate the characteristics of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and the extent of changes in drug susceptibility among ART-experienced CRF55_01B-infected adults of Guangdong. Methods: ADR was tested for immediately in CRF55_01B-infected patients with virological failure. Demographic and epidemiological information was collected. DRMs and antiretroviral susceptibility were interpreted using the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database HIVdb program. Results: Overall, 162 (4.78%) CRF55_01B isolates were identified from 2013 to 2018. Among DRMs, M184V (43.83%) was the most frequent NRTI DRM, followed by K65R (23.46%), and V179E (98.77%) was the most frequent NNRTI DRM, followed by K103N (47.53%) and Y181C (14.81%). According to the HIVdb program, 79.01% of the CRF55_01B-infected patients carried mutations conferring low-level or higher drug resistance to any of the three classes of ART drugs. Among PI DRMs, only one mutation affording low-level resistance to nelfinavir was found (0.62%). Among NRTI DRMs, a high proportion of high-level resistance to lamivudine (58.64%) and emtricitabine (58.02%) was found. As regards NNRTIs, more than 75% of patients carried efavirenz and nevirapine DRMs. The percentages of high-level resistance were 70.99%, 63.58%, 22.22%, 17.90% and 4.32% for nevirapine, efavirenz, rilpivirine, doravirine and etravirine, respectively. Conclusions: High frequencies of DRMs and resistance were observed among CRF55_01B-infected patients failing ART in Guangdong, and interventions may be considered to minimize ecological contributions to ART.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/7/1925/5821043;8.7;7.7;8.3;;32300784;;;;

Methods: HIV/AIDS patients met the criteria were all enrolled in a 1-year cohort study, in which patients receiving HAART alone were designated as Group A, those receiving HAART in combination with SLFZC were designated as Group B, and those receiving HAART in combination with QDC were designated as Group C, 100 cases in each group. The dose of SLFZC was 1.48 g (4 capsules), 3 times daily, and QDC 1.56 g (4 capsules), 3 times daily. T cell subsets, HIV RNA and HIV-1 drug resistance were detected at enrollment and 1 year after treatment. Patients were followed up every 3 months, during which side-effects and other clinical data were recorded. Results: After 1-year treatment, the median increment in CD4 counts was 165.0, 178.0 and 145.0 cells/L for Group A, B and C, respectively. HIV RNA was undetectable in 94% of patients in Group A, 96% in Group B and 92% in Group C. There were no differences regarding the increment in CD4 counts, HIV RNA and frequency of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations. Two of the 14 suspected side-effect symptoms, i.e. fatigue and dizziness, were lower in Groups B and C than in Group A (P<0.05, respectively) Conclusions: SLFZC and QDC do not have a negative impact on immunological and virological response to HAART; however, these preparations are not as potent in reducing HAART-associated side-effects as anticipated.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11655-019-3156-x;1.9;1.9;2.2;;30941681;;;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.There are limited data from prospective controlled trials regarding optimal treatment strategies in patients with primary breast diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In this phase 2 study (NCT01448096), we examined the efficacy and safety of standard immunochemotherapy and central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis using intrathecal methotrexate (IT-MTX). Thirty-three patients with newly diagnosed primary breast DLBCL received six cycles of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) and four fixed doses of IT-MTX (12 mg). The median age was 50 years (range, 29–75), and all patients were females. According to the CNS-International Prognostic Index, most patients (n = 28) were categorized as the low-risk group. Among the 33 patients, 32 completed R-CHOP, and 31 completed IT-MTX as planned. With a median follow-up of 46.1 months (interquartile range (IQR), 31.1–66.8), the 2-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 81.3% and 93.5%, respectively. Six patients experienced treatment failures, which included the CNS in four patients (two parenchyma and two leptomeninges) and breast in two patients (one ipsilateral and one contralateral). The 2-year cumulative incidence of CNS relapse was 12.5%. Although standard R-CHOP and IT-MTX without routine radiotherapy show clinically meaningful survival outcomes, this strategy may not be optimal for reducing CNS relapse and warrants further investigation.;https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/12/8/2192;8.8;5.6;3.4;;;2192;;;

The efficacy and safety of fixed dose regimen of DOACs remains unclear in morbidly obese patient population and are currently not recommended for use in patients with a body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg/m2 or a weight of >120 kg. Objective: The goal of this study is to evaluate the use of DOACs in morbidly obese veteran population as compared to warfarin. Methods: This retrospective single center cohort study included morbidly obese patients weighing >120 kg or BMI > 40 kg/m2 who were prescribed DOACs or warfarin for AF or VTE between January 1st, 2015 to May 31st, 2018. Data was extracted from the computerized patient record system (CPRS) and the Salem Veterans Affairs Medical Center (SVAMC) data warehouse. The primary outcome was combined incidence of stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) and VTE. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, ISTH major bleed and clinically relevant non major bleed as well as primary outcome and ISTH major bleeding analyses in the subgroups of AF and VTE patients. Results: The study included 190 patients in warfarin group and 214 in DOACs group. Baseline characteristics were mostly well matched except for the follow up duration which was significantly longer in the warfarin group as compared to DOAC (p > 0.001). The annual incidence rate of primary outcome was similar between warfarin and DOACs (3.91% vs.1.61%; RR:2.436; 95% CI 0.85–8.54; p = 0.1543). Conclusion: This hypothesis generating study suggests that DOAC use may be feasible in morbidly obese patients.

A fixed-dose combination therapy (polypill) was proposed as a cost-effective strategy for CVD prevention, especially in lower-resource settings. We conducted the PolyPars trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of polypill for prevention of CVD. Methods: The PolyPars trial is a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial nested within the Pars Cohort Study. Participants were randomized to an intervention arm and a control arm. Participants in the control arm received minimal non-pharmacological care, while those in the intervention arm received polypill in addition to minimal care. The polypill comprises hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg, aspirin 81 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg, and either enalapril 5 mg or valsartan 40 mg. The primary outcome of the study is defined as the first occurrence of acute coronary syndrome (non-fatal myocardial infarction and unstable angina), fatal myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, new-onset heart failure, coronary artery revascularization procedures, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accidents (fatal or non-fatal), and hospitalization due to any of the mentioned conditions. The secondary outcomes of the study include adverse events, compliance, non-cardiovascular mortality, changes in blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, and lipids after five years of follow-up. Results: From December 2014 to December 2015, 4415 participants (91 clusters) were recruited. Of those, 2200 were in the polypill arm and 2215 in the minimal care arm. The study is ongoing. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT03459560. Conclusion: Polypill may be effective for primary prevention of CVDs in developing countries.;http://www.aimjournal.ir/Article/aim-17565;2.5;2.3;2.2;;32894967;;;;

However, the combination of multiple drugs within the same dosage form can bring many physicochemical and pharmacodynamic interactions. The manufacturing process of FDC products can be challenging, especially when it is required to achieve different drug release profiles within the same dosage form to overcome physicochemical drug interactions. Monolithic, multiple-layer, and multiparticulate systems are the most common type of FDCs. Currently, the main manufacturing techniques utilized in industrial pharmaceutical companies rely on the use of combined wet and dry granulation, hot-melt extrusion coupled with spray coating, and compression of bilayered tablets. Nowadays, personalized medicines are gaining importance in clinical settings and 3D printing is taking a highlighted role in the manufacturing of complex and personalized 3D solid dosage forms that could not be manufactured using conventional techniques. In this review, it will be discussed in detail current marketed FDC products and their application in several diseases with an especial focus on antimicrobial drugs. Current industrial conventional techniques will be compared with 3D printing manufacturing of FDCs.

Methods: The pimary objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of YM155 at escalating doses (3.6, 4.8, 6.0, and 8.0 mg/m2/days) administered every 3 weeks as continuous intravenous infusion over 168 h in combination with erlotinib at a fixed dose (150 mg, once a day). Secondary objectives were to assess the pharmacokinetics of YM155, antitumor activity, and the relationship between biomarkers and efficacy. The changes in survivin expression in biopsied tumor pre- and post-YM155 administration and serum cytokine levels were also analyzed. Results: Fifteen patients were treated. The most common YM155-related adverse event was the presence of urine microalbumin, whereas grades 3/4 toxicities were rare. One patient who received 4.8 mg/m2/days YM155 developed a dose-limiting grade 2 serum creatinine elevation. YM155 exposure in plasma showed dose proportionality across all dose ranges tested. No pharmacokinetic interaction occurred between YM155 and erlotinib. The serum cytokines IL-8, G-CSF, and MIP-1b showed decreasing trends in patients who achieved progression-free survival of  12 weeks. Durable stable disease for  24 weeks was observed in two patients. Conclusion: Up to 8.0 mg/m2/days YM155 administered every 3 weeks in combination with erlotinib exhibited a favorable safety profile and moderate clinical efficacy.

All rights reserved.Background: People with mental disorders are more vulnerable to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A part of first-line treatment for HIV, efavirenz, is routinely avoided in patients with mental illness due to the risk of potential aggravation of the mental illness. This study aimed to determine the outcomes of people living with HIV/AIDS who were mental healthcare users admitted to two public-sector psychiatric facilities and who were prescribed an efavirenz-containing regimen. Materials and Methods: A retrospective drug utilization study was conducted at two public-sector psychiatric hospitals in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. Patients aged 18 years or older living with HIV were included in the study. Follow-up reviews were conducted at four, 12 and 24 weeks. The patients were seen by doctors at the hospital and notes on progress and medication were recorded in medical records. The files were then reviewed. Results: A total of 37 patients were enrolled. However, just 26 were reviewed at 24 weeks. A total of 43.2% (n=16) were female patients and the average age of the patients was 39.38±8.76 years. At the baseline, 32.4% (n=12) patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia. A total of 81.08% (n=30) of patients experienced an improvement in psychiatric symptoms after 24 weeks. Of these, 43.3% (n=13) were on an efavirenz-containing regimen. Conclusion: Majority of the patients demonstrated an improvement in their psychiatric conditions to the extent that they were discharged into the community. This finding suggests that patients with psychiatric disorders on efavirenz can experience stabilisation of their psychiatric symptoms.;None;0.5;0.5;1.2;;;;;;

METHODS In a 52-week, phase 3, randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of triple therapy at two dose levels of inhaled glucocorticoid in patients with moderate-tovery- severe COPD and at least one exacerbation in the past year, we assigned patients in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive twice-daily inhaled doses of triple therapy (inhaled glucocorticoid [320 g or 160 g of budesonide], a LAMA [18 g of glycopyrrolate], and a LABA [9.6 g of formoterol]) or one of two dual therapies (18 g of glycopyrrolate plus 9.6 g of formoterol or 320 g of budesonide plus 9.6 g of formoterol). The primary end point was the annual rate (the estimated mean number per patient per year) of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations, as analyzed in the modified intention-to-treat population with the use of on-treatment data only. RESULTS The modified intention-to-treat population comprised 8509 patients. The annual rates of moderate or severe exacerbations were 1.08 in the 320-g-budesonide triple-therapy group (2137 patients), 1.07 in the 160-g-budesonide triple-therapy group (2121 patients), 1.42 in the glycopyrrolate-formoterol group (2120 patients), and 1.24 in the budesonide-formoterol group (2131 patients). The rate was significantly lower with 320-g-budesonide triple therapy than with glycopyrrolate- formoterol (24% lower: rate ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 0.83; P<0.001) or budesonide-formoterol (13% lower: rate ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.95; P = 0.003). Similarly, the rate was significantly lower with 160-g-budesonide triple therapy than with glycopyrrolate-formoterol (25% lower: rate ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.83; P<0.001) or budesonide-formoterol (14% lower: rate ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.95; P = 0.002). The incidence of any adverse event was similar across the treatment groups (range, 61.7 to 64.5%); the incidence of confirmed pneumonia ranged from 3.5 to 4.5% in the groups that included inhaled glucocorticoid use and was 2.3% in the glycopyrrolate-formoterol group. CONCLUSIONS Triple therapy with twice-daily budesonide (at either the 160-g or 320-g dose), glycopyrrolate, and formoterol resulted in a lower rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations than glycopyrrolate-formoterol or budesonide-formoterol.

INSTIs have proven to be efficacious in virologic suppression in combination with other antiretrovirals (ARVs); however, recent data has demonstrated a potential link between weight gain and INSTIs, causing concern for risk of developing further metabolic complications. The intent of this review was to understand the magnitude of the weight gain and whether INSTIs were the sole cause. Recent Findings: Of 71 studies conducted on this topic, 25 trials were evaluated and organized into treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced studies. While these studies were not designed homogeneously, clear patterns emerged while assessing the data. Among treatment-naïve populations, dolutegravir (DTG) generally exhibited greater levels of weight gain when compared with elvitegravir (EVG) and raltegravir (RAL). Furthermore, some studies demonstrated greater weight gain with DTG-containing groups when combined with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). Studies in treatment-experienced patients switching to an INSTI-based regimen exhibited similar patterns. DTG was once again associated with the most weight gain in this population, with weight gain also exhibited with RAL and EVG. Due to bictegravir (BIC) being a newer agent, there was limited data in both populations. Summary: This compilation of data suggests a link between the INSTI class and weight gain. However, it remains unclear whether weight gain occurs with INSTI initiation or long-term treatment. As more data supports the INSTI class causing weight gain, the cardiovascular and metabolic ramifications have yet to be investigated. Future research should study populations at greater risk for gaining weight, the occurrence of comorbidities associated with weight gain, and data on emerging integrase inhibitors.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11908-020-00727-w;3.8;4.4;5.3;;;19;;;

To address this challenge, metagenomic and metabolomic techniques, were applied, and immune factors and mucosal barrier-related proteins were determined to reveal the effects of fermented D. candidum polyphenols (FDC) on intestinal inflammation induced by oxazolone in zebrafish. The results showed that fermentation significantly changed the chemical composition of D. candidum and that FDC significantly improved the intestinal immune index. After the 21st day of FDC intervention, the abundance of Lactobacillus, Faecalibacterium, and Rummeliibacillus increased, but the abundance of the genera Shewanella, Geodermatophilus, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Mycobacterium decreased. At the same time, FDC significantly increased intestinal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). In addition, network analysis based on multi-omics indicated that FDC intake leads to changes in intestinal microbiota and intestinal metabolites, resulting in enhanced host immune function. These results indicate that FDC can improve intestinal health by regulating the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites to treat intestinal inflammation and regulate the host immune system. The present research improved our understanding of the utilization of D. candidum polyphenols and provided new evidence for the impacts of fermented D. candidum on host health.";https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01542/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;32765533;1542;;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Background: Patients admitted to obstetrics and gynaecology (OBGY) departments are at high risk of infections and subsequent antibiotic prescribing, which may contribute to antibiotic resistance (ABR). Although antibiotic surveillance is one of the cornerstones to combat ABR, it is rarely performed in low-and middle-income countries. Aim: To describe and compare antibiotic prescription patterns among the inpatients in OBGY departments of two tertiary care hospitals, one teaching (TH) and one nonteaching (NTH), in Central India. Methods: Data on patients’ demographics, diagnoses and prescribed antibiotics were collected prospectively for three years. Patients were divided into two categories-infectious and non-infectious diagnosis and were further divided into three groups: surgical, nonsurgical and possible-surgical indications. The data was coded based on the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system, and the International Classification of Disease system version-10 and Defined Daily Doses (DDDs) were calculated per 1000 patients. Results: In total, 5558 patients were included in the study, of those, 81% in the TH and 85% in the NTH received antibiotics (p < 0.001). Antibiotics were prescribed frequently to the inpatients in the nonsurgical group without any documented bacterial infection (TH-71%; NTH-75%). Prescribing of broad-spectrum, fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of antibiotics was more common in both categories in the NTH than in the TH. Overall, higher DDD/1000 patients were prescribed in the TH in both categories. Conclusions: Antibiotics were frequently prescribed to the patients with no documented infectious indications. Misprescribing of the broad-spectrum FDCs of antibiotics and unindicated prescribing of antibiotics point towards threat of ABR and needs urgent action. Antibiotics prescribed to the inpatients having nonbacterial infection indications is another point of concern that requires action. Investigation of underlying reasons for prescribing antibiotics for unindicated diagnoses and the development and implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs are recommended measures to improve antibiotic prescribing practice.";https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/9/8/464;3.8;3.3;3.0;;;464;;;

This cross-sectional study enrolled 170 HIV-1-infected individuals of three major ethnicities who attended three HIV outpatient clinics in Malaysia. Questionnaire was used to obtain sociodemographic data while CD4 count and viral load data were gathered from hospital's record. Multiple factors were assessed for their predictive effects on CD4 count recovery (500 cells/mm3) and viral load suppression (50 copies/mL) using binary logistic regression. Most of the subjects were male (149/87.6%), in the age group 30 to 39 years old (78/45.9%) and got infected via homosexual contact (82/48.2%). Indians were associated with 11 times higher chance for CD4 recovery as compared to Malays at 8 to 12 months of HAART (adjusted OR: 10.948, 95% CI: 1.873, 64.001, P =.008). Viral load suppression was positively influenced by intravenous drug use (IVDU) status (adjusted OR: 35.224, 95% CI: 1.234, 1000.489, P =.037) at 4 to 6 months of HAART. Higher pretreatment CD4 count was a positive predictor for both initial immunological and virological responses while higher pretreatment viral load was a negative predictor for virological suppression only. In conclusion, ethnicity plays a significant role in determining early immune reconstitution in Malaysia, besides pretreatment CD4 count. Further studies are needed to identify possible biological factors underlying this association.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25680;3.8;3.9;4.0;;31957025;;;;

Materials and methods We studied the association between HIV subtypes and immunologic and virologic outcomes in a longitudinal cohort of 169 patients on combination antiretroviral therapy. Participants were followed up for 5 years. Demographic data, CD4 cell count and viral loads (VL) were extracted from medical records. Whole protease gene and codon 1–300 of the reverse transcriptase gene were sequenced and analysed. Results Sixty-four percent of participants were females with a median age of 35 years. Twelve different subtypes were observed, the commonest being CRF 02_AG (55.0%) and subtypes G (23.1%). All subtypes showed steady rise in CD4 count and there was no difference in proportion who achieved CD4+ cell count rise of 100 cells/L from baseline within 12 months’ post-initiation of ART, or 350 cells/L at 60 months’ post-initiation. Median time to attaining a rise of 350 cells/L was 24 months (6–48 months). The proportion that achieved undetectable VL at month 6 and 12 post-initiation of ART were comparable across subtypes. At end of 5th year, there was no statistical difference in proportion with virologic failure. Conclusion No association between HIV subtypes and immunologic or virologic response to therapy was observed, suggesting that current first-line ART may have similar efficacy across subtype predominating in South-West Nigeria.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238027;5.7;5.4;5.2;;32841264;e0238027;;;

Few studies have assessed the immunohistological features of KFD, and most employed limited antibody panels that lacked many of the novel immunohistochemistry markers currently available. Methods and results: We used immunohistochemistry to reappraise the microanatomical distribution of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), follicular helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells, B cells, follicular dendritic cell (FDC) meshworks, and histiocytes in lymph nodes involved by KFD. The study group consisted of 138 KFD patients (89 women; 64.5%) with a median age of 27 years (range, 3–50 years). Cervical lymph nodes were most commonly involved, in 108 (78.3%) patients. The numbers of pDCs were increased, predominantly around and within apoptotic areas and the paracortex, and tapering off within xanthomatous areas. pDCs formed sizeable tight clusters, most notably around apoptotic/necrotic areas. T cells consisted mostly of CD8-positive cells with predominant expression of T-cell receptor-. There were notable increases in the numbers of CD8-positive T cells within lymphoid follicles, and their numbers correlated with alterations in FDC meshworks (P < 0.001). The number of follicular helper T cells was decreased within distorted FDC meshworks. CD21 highlighted frequent distortion of FDC meshworks, even in lymph node tissue that was distant from apoptotic/necrotic areas. Distorted FDC meshworks spanned all morphological patterns, and FDC meshwork characteristics (intact; distorted; remnant/nearly absent) correlated with morphological patterns (P < 0.01).

A fixed-dose combination (FDC) of rosuvastatin/ezetimibe is indicated as an adjunctive therapy to diet for the management of primary hypercholesterolemia in adults in numerous countries worldwide. In well-designed clinical trials evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of rosuvastatin/ezetimibe administered as either separate agents or as an FDC, rosuvastatin/ezetimibe was significantly more effective than rosuvastatin monotherapy (including at double the dose of rosuvastatin) or simvastatin/ezetimibe in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol in adults with hypercholesterolemia. Furthermore, rosuvastatin/ezetimibe enabled significantly higher proportions of patients to achieve recommended LDL-C levels than rosuvastatin monotherapy or simvastatin/ezetimibe. Rosuvastatin/ezetimibe did not significantly differ from rosuvastatin monotherapy with respect to incidences of treatment-related or serious adverse events in these short-term trials and displayed a similar safety profile to simvastatin/ezetimibe. While additional cardiovascular outcomes data and head-to-head comparisons with atorvastatin/ezetimibe would be of interest, rosuvastatin/ezetimibe is a potent and generally well-tolerated drug combination that extends the range of options available for the pharmacological management of primary hypercholesterolemia in adults.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40256-020-00421-1;5.4;4.6;4.7;;32648167;;;;

We previously demonstrated the presence of estrogen receptor alpha (ER)+CD23+ FDCs in grades 1-2 FL. The significance of FDCs as a prognostic factor in FL remains unknown. The current study aimed to compare clinicopathological features, including prognosis, between FL with and without ER+ FDCs. This study evaluated the clinicopathological significance of ER expression in 70 FL patients by immunostaining. The presence of ER mRNA on FDCs from 5 FL patients was confirmed by CD21/ER double staining (immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization). We defined patients with frequent ER expression as the ERhigh group and those with infrequent ER expression as the ERlow group. Thirty-two patients were assigned to the ERhigh group (45.7%), and 38 patients were assigned to the ERlow group (54.3%). Both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were significantly better in the ERhigh group than in the ERlow group (OS, log-rank, P =.0465; PFS, log-rank, P =.0336). Moreover, high ER expression on FDCs was an independent prognostic factor for OS in both the univariate ([hazard ratio] HR, 0.163; P =.0260) and multivariate (HR, 0.050; P =.0188) analyses and for PFS in both the univariate (HR, 0.232; P =.0213) and multivariate (HR, 0.084; P =.0243) analyses.

To the best of our knowledge, since the introduction of HBV vaccination, there have been limited data for vaccine response to HBV and its impact on early childhood HBV infections among children HIV exposed but uninfected in Botswana. Aims: To determine the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV vaccine response in 18 months old children HIV exposed but uninfected in Botswana. Methods: Stored plasma samples from 304 children at 18 months of age and 287 mothers from delivery were tested for HBsAg. Mothers with positive HBsAg had HBV DNA level tested, and their HBV genotypes were determined by amplifying a 415-base pair (bp) region of the surface gene. Plasma samples from children exposed to HIV were tested for hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) titers. Results: No children (0 of 304) were positive for HBsAg at 18 months while 5 (1.74%) of 287 HIV-positive mothers were HBsAg positive. Four of the HBsAg positive mothers were infected with genotype A1, while 1 was infected with genotype E. The median anti-HBs titer in children was 174 mIU/mL [QR: 70, 457]. Three (1.1%) of 269 children had an inadequate vaccine response (<10 mIU/mL), while 266 (98.9%) of 269 had protective immunity. However, when using the 100mIU/mL threshold, only 170 (63.2%) of 269 children had complete protection. Conclusion: No HBsAg positivity was identified in a cohort of children HIV exposed but uninfected. The absence of HBsAg positives was associated with good HBV vaccine responses and low maternal HBsAg prevalence in Botswana.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237252;5.7;5.4;5.2;;32764801;e0237252;;;

For patients with more severe symptoms, initial treatment with long acting 2-agonists and long-acting muscarinic antagonists combination therapy is recommended. Tiotropium + olodaterol fixed-dose combination (Tio + Olo FDC) is an aqueous solution of tiotropium bromide and olodaterol delivered by the RESPIMAT® Soft Mist™ inhaler for patients with moderate to very severe COPD. Methods: This single site, open-label, phase Ib clinical study assessed the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profiles of once-daily Tio + Olo FDC (5 g/5 g) after single dose and at steady state in Chinese patients with moderate to severe COPD over 3 weeks. The PK and safety profiles of Japanese and Caucasian populations from 2 independent COPD studies were provided for comparison. Results: A total of 12 Chinese patients received Tio + Olo FDC. After multiple inhaled administration of Tio + Olo FDC, tiotropium and olodaterol were rapidly absorbed and reached peak plasma concentration at about 5 and 25 min, respectively. The accumulation ratios after multiple administrations were 1.3 and 1.6 for tiotropium and olodaterol in Chinese patients. Tio + Olo FDC was well-tolerated; all AEs were mild.

This study assessed the perspective of private physicians (PPs) on adopting the core strategies of the IHCI in Bhopal district of Madhya Pradesh. A semi-structured interview was purposely applied to 30 PPs to obtain their opinions on standardized hypertension treatment protocols, patient-centered services, and easy-to-use information system in their private practices. Verbatim data were recorded and analyzed thematically. Only 11 PPs followed the state hypertension treatment protocol. Among the remaining 19 PPs, the major reasons for not adopting protocol were (1) limited availability of single component hypertension drugs, (2) preferences for fixed dose combinations (FDCs), and (3) fear of either losing patients due to a lack of immediate blood pressure control or causing drug-related adverse effects. None of the interviewed doctors had resources to provide patient-centered care and use a digital health information system. Overall, the interviewed doctors identified that free supply of hypertension treatment protocol drugs, inclusion of FDCs in treatment protocol, increasing number of staff for follow-up visits, and patient education, IT-based solutions. for patient records, employee incentives, and need for national data sharing policies are the key actions to accelerate the adoption of IHCI strategies in the private sector. This exploratory qualitative study suggests that engagement of private sector in the IHCI is feasible. Plans to expand the IHCI to the private sector should consider ensuring the wider availability of hypertension treatment protocol drugs and developing a simple user-friendly digital platform for patient monitoring.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jch.13944;4.3;3.8;4.0;;;;;;

Furthermore, the durability of viral suppression among HIV individuals taking ART is unknown. Information on incidence rates and factors associated with HIV viral load rebound and the durability of viral suppression (undetectable HIV copies in plasma) among HIV-infected individuals taking ART, will help improve the long-term management of HIV-infected individuals and explore approaches to long-term HIV remission or complete cure. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to investigate the incidence rates of viral rebound following viral suppression, factors associated with viral rebound, and the durability of viral suppression among HIV-infected individuals on ART from Kilifi, Meru, and Nakuru counties in Kenya. Methods: This was a retrospective study involving 600 HIV-infected individuals taking combination ART (cART) and enrolled in comprehensive care centers (CCCs) at Malindi Sub-county Hospital, Nakuru Level 5 Hospital, and Meru Level 5 Hospital in Kenya. The medical files were inspected and medical history records abstracted for the selected participants. Participant laboratory data including HIV viral loads, types and history of ART, and treatment history of any opportunistic infections were abstracted using an abstraction checklist. Participants were grouped into those who achieved HIV viral suppression, with viral loads lower than the detection limit (LDL) (viral suppression), and those who experienced one or more detectable viral load measurements >40 copies/ml following the initial LDL (viral rebound). Durable viral suppression was defined as all viral load values at LDL over the 2-year period (2017–2019). Univariate and multivariate Poisson regression analyses were performed to assess the rates of viral rebound, as well as to investigate factors associated with it. Results: Out of 549 HIV-positive patients, 324/549 (59%) achieved HIV viral suppression (Meru 159/194 (82%), Nakuru 21/178 (12%), and Malindi 144/177 (81%)). The overall viral rebound rate was 41%, with site-specific viral rebound of 88.2%, 18.6%, and 18.0% in Nakuru, Malindi, and Meru, respectively. There was an overall rate of first viral rebound of 3.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.9–14.4), 0.7 (95% CI 0.5–1.0), and 0.89 (95% CI 0.64–1.24) per 100 person-months in Nakuru, Malindi, and Meru, respectively. Good ART adherence (p = 0.0002), widow status (p = 0.0062), and World Health Organization (WHO) stage I (p = 0.0002) were associated with viral suppression, while poor ART adherence (p < 0.0001), WHO stage II (p = 0.0024), and duration on ART of 36 months (p = 0.0350) were associated with viral rebound. Conclusions: The rate of viral suppression in patients on cART in the CCCs fell short of the WHO target. However, the study provides proof of evidence of undetectable viral load levels for more than 2 years, a sign that the United Nation's 2030 objective of controlling the risk of HIV transmission could be achieved.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1201971220304045;5.3;5.6;5.3;S1201971220304045;32497804;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1201971220304045;;

Methods: Publically available data on health and safety inspection violations on FDC homes were merged with engagement data from a staffed family child network. Descriptive analysis, logistic regression, and latent class analysis were used. Results: Network FDC homes, compared to non-network FDC homes, were less likely to have health and safety violations in the areas of Child/Family/Staff Documentation (43.1% vs. 53.6%, p = 0.001) and Indoor Safety (36.0% vs. 42.6%, p =.041). Controlling for area median income and for decades since obtaining license, network FDC homes had fewer violations, fewer violation categories, and less variety of violation categories. Additionally, FDC homes which were not engaged with the staffed family child network but were in the city or town in which the network offered services, performed better compared to FDC homes in cities or towns without network resources. Conclusions for Practice: The better compliance among network FDC homes and among FDC homes in cities and towns where the network offers services, suggests that the network is having positive effects on health and safety quality in FDC homes. A staffed child care network may be a means to improve child care quality and may be a means of improving educational and health outcomes for children.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10995-020-02939-x;3.5;3.4;3.6;;32350728;;;;

We compared the long-term virological outcomes of two cohorts of children living in a rural setting of South Africa. The first cohort initiated treatment before one year and the second after two years of age. The aim of this study was to describe the long-term consequences of early treatment initiation in terms of viral load and drug-resistance. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at the Edendale Hospital located in a peri-urban area of KwaZulu-Natal. Children were included during their planned appointment. Drug resistance was assessed genotypically on proviral DNA. Results: From the 161 children included in this study, 93 samples were successfully genotyped. Both cohorts had comparable viral loads, but children treated early more often presented NRTI or NNRTI mutations, while there was no difference for PI mutations rates. Conclusions: Treatment was highly effective when comparing virological outcomes in both early- and late-treated cohorts. The persistence of NNRTI mutations could lead to treatment failures in children older than 3 years initiating their therapy with a NNRTI, or for those switching from a PI to NNRTI based regimen. The accumulation of NRTI mutations may lead to a functional PI monotherapy and consequently to viral escape.

Materials & methods: A total of 184 treatment-naive HIV-infected patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a lower dose (tenofovir disoproxil 200 mg, efavirenz 400 mg and lamivudine) or a standard dose regimen. Relationships between pharmacogenomics and efavirenz pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics were explored at 48 weeks. Results: There was no relationship between pharmacogenomics and adverse reactions of the central nervous system and antiretoviral efficacy. CYP2B6 516G>T, 785A>G, 18492C>T and ABCB1 3435C>T T/C were associated with higher efavirenz plasma levels in the standard but not the lower dose group. No relationship was found between pharmacogenomics and antiretoviral efficacy. Patients who were <60 kg had higher efavirenz concentration compared with those with weight 60 kg when using 600 mg efavirenz, this was not observed with 400 mg efavirenz. Conclusion: The effect of pharmacogenomics and body weight on the efavirenz concentration was significant in the 600 mg group but not in the 400 mg group.;https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/10.2217/pgs-2019-0169;3.9;4.0;3.7;;32838647;;;;

Prior studies suggest that VL suppression is influenced by antiretroviral regimen. In this study, using secondary real-life data from the Ministry of Health of Brazil, we compared VL suppression at 60–180 days after the first antiretroviral therapy (ART) prescription during pregnancy and time to undetectable VL among pregnant women under treatment with double nucleoside/nucleotide regimens combined with efavirenz, boosted lopinavir, boosted atazanavir, or raltegravir, with adjustment for potential confounders in multivariable models. A total of 18,997 pregnant women living with HIV were included in the study. Compared to regimens containing lopinavir, we found that atazanavir-, efavirenz-, and raltegravir-based regimens were superior in achieving both outcomes after adjustment for age, social vulnerability index, time under ART, baseline CD4+ cell count, and baseline HIV VL. Raltegravir-containing regimens had the highest adjusted odds/rates of VL suppression compared to patients with other regimens. Elimination of HIV MTCT is still a critical public health issue in many countries. Our findings suggest that raltegravir-based regimens were superior when compared to efavirenz-, lopinavir-, and atazanavir-based antiretroviral regimens in achieving suppression of HIV VL.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956462420932688;2.5;2.5;2.7;;32702281;;;;

All rights reserved.Objective:The current study was planned to formulate, characterize and evaluate the pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a novel 'NanoFDC' comprising hydrochlorothiazide, candesartan (CNDT) and amlodipine.Methodology:The candidate drugs were loaded in poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) by emulsion-diffusion-evaporation method. The formulations were evaluated for their size, morphology, drug loading and in-vitro release individually. Repeat dose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of the nano-fixed dose combination (FDC) was done in dexamethasone-induced animal model.Results:The entrapment efficiencies ranged from 44±2.1, 32.2±4 and 40.5±2.6% for amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide and CNDT, respectively. The nanoparticles ranged in size from 164 to 215nm. In-vitro release profile of the nanoformulation showed unto 90% release by day 7 in simulated gastric fluid and simulated intestinal fluid, respectively. In pharmacokinetic analysis a sustained-release for 7 days was observed in nano-FDC group. Once weekly oral dosing of nano-FDC of amlodipine, CNDT and hydrochlorothiazide provided adequate antihypertensive effect which was not statistically different from daily dosing of free drugs in dexamethasone-induced animal model.Conclusion:Once weekly oral dosing of nano-FDC of amlodipine, CNDT and hydrochlorothiazide provided adequate antihypertensive effect and was not statistically different from daily dosing of free drugs in dexamethasone-induced animal model. This study provides proof of concept of feasibility of once weekly dosing of a nano-FDC comprising three antihypertensive drugs, which can lead to significant improvement in patient adherence to therapy.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/HJH.0000000000002429;7.2;6.6;6.7;;32371763;;;;

Adults with International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-1/2- or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) were randomized 1:1 to receive oral cedazuridine/decitabine or IV decitabine in cycle 1, followed by crossover to the other treatment in cycle 2. All patients received oral cedazuridine/decitabine in subsequent cycles. Cedazuridine and decitabine were given initially as separate capsules in a dose-confirmation stage and then as a single fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet. Primary end points: mean decitabine systemic exposure (geometric least-squares mean [LSM]) of oral/IV 5-day area under curve from time 0 to last measurable concentration (AUClast), percentage long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) DNA demethylation for oral cedazuridine/decitabine vs IV decitabine, and clinical response. Eighty patients were randomized and treated. Oral/IV ratios of geometric LSM 5-day AUClast (80% confidence interval) were 93.5% (82.1-106.5) and 97.6% (80.5-118.3) for the dose-confirmation and FDC stages, respectively. Differences in mean % LINE-1 demethylation between oral and IV were £1%. Clinical responses were observed in 48 patients (60%), including 17 (21%) with complete response. The most common grade ‡3 adverse events regardless of causality were neutropenia (46%), thrombocytopenia (38%), and febrile neutropenia (29%).

How modes of GC B cell migration influence plasma cell development remained unclear. Through genetic deletion of the F-actin bundling protein Swiprosin-1/EF-hand domain family member 2 (EFhd2) and by two-photon microscopy, we show that EFhd2 restrains B cell speed in GCs and hapten-specific plasma cell output. Modeling the GC reaction reveals that increasing GC B cell speed promotes plasma cell generation. Lack of EFhd2 also reduces contacts of GC B cells with follicular dendritic cells in vivo. Computational modeling uncovers that both GC output and antibody affinity depend quantitatively on contacts of GC B cells with follicular dendritic cells when B cells migrate more persistently. Collectively, our data explain how GC B cells integrate speed and persistence of cell migration with B cell receptor affinity.© 2020 The AuthorsReimer et al. show that EFhd2 restricts migration of germinal center B cells and hapten-specific immunity. Selection of speedy germinal center B cells occurs earlier and they are more likely to differentiate. EFhd2 supports contact of germinal center B cells with follicular dendritic cells, enabling successful competition of rapidly migrating germinal center B cells.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211124720310159;12.6;12.3;12.6;S2211124720310159;32783949;108030;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2211124720310159;;

These factors must be considered when appraising asthma interventions and their effectiveness in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates [UAE]). Based on published studies, the most prevalent asthma treatment in these countries are fixed dose combinations (FDC) of inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta-agonist (ICS/LABA). This study is a rapid review of the literature on: (a) factors associated with asthma control in the GCC countries and (b) generalisability of ICS/LABA FDC effectiveness studies. Methods: To review local factors associated with asthma control and, generalisability of published ICS/LABA FDC studies, two rapid reviews were conducted. Review 1 targeted literature pertaining to asthma control factors in GCC countries. Eligible studies were appraised, and clustering methodology used to summarise factors. Review 2 assessed ICS/LABA FDC studies in conditions close to actual clinical practice (i.e. effectiveness studies). Eligibility was determined by reviewing study characteristics. Evaluation of studies focused on randomised controlled trials (RCTs). In both reviews, initial (January 2018) and updated (November 2019) searches were conducted in EMBASE and PubMed databases. Eligible studies were appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklists. Results: We identified 51 publications reporting factors associated with asthma control. These publications reported studies conducted in Saudi Arabia (35), Qatar (5), Kuwait (5), UAE (3), Oman (1) and multiple countries (2). The most common factors associated with asthma control were: asthma-related education (13 articles), demographics (11articles), comorbidities (11 articles) and environmental exposures (11 articles). Review 2 identified 61 articles reporting ICS/LABA FDC effectiveness studies from countries outside of the GCC. Of these, six RCTs were critically appraised. The adequacy of RCTs in informing clinical practice varied when appraised against previously published criteria. Conclusions: Asthma-related education was the most recurring factor associated with asthma control in the GCC countries. Moreover, the generalisability of ICS/LABA FDC studies to this region is variable. Hence, asthma patients in the region, particularly those on ICS/LABA FDC, will continue to require physician review and oversight. While our findings provide evidence for local treatment guidelines, further research is required in GCC countries to establish the causal pathways through which asthma-related education influence asthma control for patients on ICS/LABA FDC therapy.;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09259-3;4.4;4.3;3.9;;32770967;1211;;;

Fixel based analysis (FBA), at the cutting-edge of diffusion-weighted imaging, can account for crossing WM fibers and can provide indices of both WM micro- and macrostructure. We applied FBA to investigate WM structure between 25 (12 males, 13 females) adults with ASD and 24 (12 males, 12 females) matched controls. As the role of biological sex on the neuropathophysiology of ASD is of increasing interest, this was also explored. There were no significant differences in WM micro- or macrostructure between adults with ASD and matched healthy controls. When data were stratified by sex, females with ASD had reduced fiber density and cross-section (FDC), a combined metric comprised of micro- and macrostructural measures, in the corpus callosum, a finding not detected between the male sub-groups. We conclude that micro- and macrostructural WM aberrations are present in ASD, and may be influenced by biological sex.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnint.2020.00040/full;7.8;5.1;3.7;;;40;;;

The reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients treated for hypertension is directly related to the magnitude of blood pressure reduction. Diuretics have proven useful for the prevention of cardiovascular complications in addition to a long history of safety and efficacy. The main aim for this meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy of the combination of angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and chlorthalidone (CTLD) to the combination of ARB and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in patients with hypertension. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted through electronic databases PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, PsyInfo, Cochrane, eLIBRARY.ru, http://ClinicalTrials.gov and http://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu in July 2020 to identify studies that investigate the effect of the combination of angiotensin receptor blocker with chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide on the systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) expressed as a weighted mean difference (WMD) were our primary outcomes. The random-effects method was chosen as the primary analysis and results were presented with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Sensitivity analysis was performed and bias was assessed. Results: Our search returned 2745 titles. Of them, 51 full-text articles remained to be subjected to assessment. Comparisons of ARB/HCTZ versus ARB showed changes in BP of -6.89 (-8.09, -5.69) mmHg for systolic BP and - 3.67 (-4.15, -3.19) mmHg for diastolic BP. For the ARB/CTLD versus ARB/HCTZ comparison changes were - 6.30 (-7.30, -5.29) mmHg for systolic BP and - 3.57 (-4.17, 2.98) mmHg for diastolic BP. Conclusion: Our analysis suggests a small but significant favor for CTLD in blood pressure control when compared to HCTZ. We believe it should be considered as a valuable alternative for HCTZ and an option for fixed dose combinations with an ARB although further research is required.;https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13643-020-01457-9;4.5;5.7;3.7;;32838806;195;;;

To the best of authors’ knowledge there are no reported methods for chiral purity estimation of both drugs simultaneously from a FDC. The current study was focused on the development of a single chiral method uisng supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) for separation of stereoisomers of TDF and 3TC combination employing design of experiment (DoE) approach. Method development was planned in three steps by using different experimental designs for each step. I-optimal, Taguchi orthogonal array and face-centred central composite designs (CCD) were employed for primary parameter selection, secondary parameter screening and final method optimization, respectively. All six stereoisomers were separated in a 10 minute run on Chiralpak IA column with carbon di-oxide /methanol (containing 0.5 % v/v n-butylamine) as mobile phase at 1.5 mL/min in gradient mode. The optimized method was verified for performance through establishing specificity, precision, linearity, accuracy, limit of quantification, and solution stability. Resolution between each isomeric pair was more than 1.5. The method was found to be linear from 1.5 µg/mL to 7.5 µg/mL for 3TC and 7.5 µg/mL to 37.5 µg/mL for TDF stereoisomers. The R2 values for all the linearity curves for undesired isomers were greater than 0.995. The method proved to be rapid, reproducible and efficient to quantify stereoisomers of both drugs in a single run.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021967320305355;7.0;6.8;7.5;S0021967320305355;32709317;461257;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0021967320305355;;

FDCS in the uterine cervix has not yet been reported. Case presentation: A 49-year-old woman was referred to our department with a cervical tumor, which was histologically suspected to be undifferentiated carcinoma. She underwent hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic lymphadenectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin. The resected specimen contained high numbers of spindle cells and was immunohistochemically confirmed to be FDCS. The tumor was completely resected and recurrence was not detected at a 16-month follow-up.

The studied analytes were isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R), pyrazinamide (Z) and ethambutol (E) in fixed dose combination recommended to patients under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP, India). The analytes were extracted from the human plasma (150 µL) using the single step liquid-liquid extraction approach and were analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The method was fully validated, according to USFDA guidelines. A linear range of 0.05-10 µg mL-1, 0.1-20 µg mL-1, 0.5-100 µg mL-1 and 0.05-10 µg mL-1 for H, R, Z and E respectively was established, presenting determination coefficients above 0.99. Concerning imprecision, the CV was lower than 15% for all analytes. All tested analytes were found to be stable in the samples. Although the values obtained for recovery were above 85%, the method proved to be sensitive, since low detection limits of 0.05 µg mL-1 for H and E, 0.1 µg mL-1 for R and 0.5 µg mL-1 for Z were obtained. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy and imprecision were within CV ±15%. The use of the conventional silica column in the extraction of these compounds through a single step protein precipitation method simplifies the analytical process. In addition due to its simplicity and sensitivity, it can be applied to carry out therapeutic drug monitoring and drug level assessment in human plasma samples. The results of analyte levels are comparable to other reported methods. The method had been successfully applied for simultaneous determination of first line anti-tubercular drugs in pulmonary tubercular patients. The method requires 150 µL of patient plasma and offers low volume for injection (10 µL) and blood sample collection (3 mL) which will be an added advantage for pediatric anti-TB drug level assessment and monitoring.;http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=D0AY00889C;3.9;4.2;4.5;;;;;;

The abnormal survival of CLL B cells is explained by a plethora of supportive stimuli produced by the surrounding cells of the microenvironment, including follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). This crosstalk between malignant cells and normal cells can take place directly by cell-to-cell contact (assisted by adhesion molecules such as VLA-4 or CD100), indirectly by soluble factors (chemokines such as CXCL12, CXCL13, or CCL2) interacting with their receptors or by the exchange of material (protein, microRNAs or long non-coding RNAs) via extracellular vesicles. These different communication methods lead to different activation pathways (including BCR and NFB pathways), gene expression modifications (chemokines, antiapoptotic protein increase, prognostic biomarkers), chemotaxis, homing in lymphoid tissues and survival of leukemic cells. In addition, these interactions are bidirectional, and CLL cells can manipulate the normal surrounding stromal cells in different ways to establish a supportive microenvironment. Here, we review this complex crosstalk between CLL cells and stromal cells, focusing on the different types of interactions, activated pathways, treatment strategies to disrupt this bidirectional communication, and the prognostic impact of these induced modifications.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fonc.2020.01422/full;8.6;5.4;3.5;;;1422;;;

The methodologies for manufacturer, wholesale, and retail price establishment have been compared using nationally implemented rules. Overlapping trademarks were established retrospectively on the manufacturer and retail levels in November 2017. The average price per tablet, percentage of price deviation, and statistically significant differences were calculated. The selected countries apply external reference pricing at the manufacturer level. A wide variation in the number of referent countries was observed (from 12 to 27). Despite the use of a regressive scale for price calculation, large variations between margins and value-added tax (VAT) are established, thus leading to different final medicine prices. This study found that medicine prices were lower in RO than in other selected countries. It was caused by the fact that 15 products had the lowest manufacturer price and 14 products had the lowest retail price in RO. Results of Kruskal–Wallis test showed that there were no significant differences between prices per tablet on the manufacturer and retail levels. In the group of fixed-dose combinations, ramipril/hydrochlorothiazide, and irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide showed more than 100% deviation. The prices of cardiovascular medicines differed within the observed countries. The differences in pricing methodologies (e.g., margins, VAT) at the national level did not significantly affect retail prices, as a low manufacturer price usually leads to a low retail price.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00433/full;3.8;2.4;2.0;;;433;;;

The sorbilis variety of guarana is anciently cultivated and is used today for the industry of soft drinks, cosmetic and pharmaceutical. Transcriptome, proteome, light and electron microscopy were used to compare symptomatic and asymptomatic tissues and reveal anatomical, histological and cytological alterations resultant from the disease. Disease symptoms described here include a marked reduction in the longitudinal axis and the formation of “capsules”, named as this for the first time here, which display hard thickened external walls and contain extremely malformed floral organs and/or poorly differentiated vegetative primordia when occurring isolate in individual branching points. The aggregate of multiple “capsules” in a same branch point produces galls. The production of indol-acetic acid (IAA) in vitro by F. decemcellulare was for the first time reported and the comparative transcriptome and preliminary proteome data from symptomatic and asymptomatic tissues, support the occurrence of hormonal imbalance identified through several plant hormone-related genes and proteins differentially expressed only in symptomatic tissues. Auxin signaling mechanism, as well as auxin-responsive genes associated to cell cycling, division and proliferation also occurred differentially in infected tissues. Oversprouting and the reduction of the longitudinal axis in malformed cells and organs are related to hormonal unbalance are discussed in this paper.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12042-020-09256-1;2.3;2.6;2.7;;;;;;

Given the economic impact, French guidelines recommend using generic antiretroviral therapy when possible to decrease antiretroviral therapy costs. We aimed to study HIV-infected patients’ acceptability to switch from a brand single-tablet regimens [abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir (Triumeq®) or emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/rilpivirine (Eviplera®)] to a treatment comprising of two pills: one is a fixed-dose generic combination of 2 Nucleoside Analogs and the second tablet is the third antiretroviral. This study was a prospective observational study in a French hospital. During their followup, patients on stable single-tablet regimens were made aware of the possible cost-saving. They were questioned about their willingness and barriers accepting the substitution. Participants chose between the two regimens, either to remain on single-tablet regimens or switch to the de-simplified regimen. Six months later, a second survey was given to the patient who chose to de-simplify and HIV viral load was controlled. The study included 98 patients: 60 receiving emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/rilpivirine (Eviplera®) and 38 on abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir (Triumeq®). Forty-five patients accepted the de-simplified treatment, 37 refused and 16 were undecided and followed the decision offered by their physician. The main reason for unwillingness to switch is the number of pills (77.3%). In multivariate model analysis, male patients (p = 0.001) who have taken antiretroviral therapy for over 20 years (p = 0.04) and who retrieve their treatment in their community hospital (p = 0.03) are more likely to accept the switch.

METHODS: A 16-week, investigator-blinded study in patients with moderate psoriasis (Physician&rsquo;s Global Assessment [PGA] score of 3). Patients were randomized 1:1 to Cal/BD foam plus apremilast or vehicle foam plus apremilast for 4 weeks, followed by 8 weeks of apremilast monotherapy, and then 4 weeks of combination therapy as in the original randomization schedule. Efficacy assessments &ndash; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), PGA, body surface area (BSA), visual analog scale (VAS) for pruritus, and quality of life (QoL) &ndash; and safety were evaluated at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 12, and 16. RESULTS: 28 subjects were enrolled (mean age, 64 years; 67.9% males). Cal/BD foam plus apremilast group achieved statistically significantly greater improvement than vehicle foam plus apremilast in PASI75 (50% vs 7%; P=.003), PGA score of &ldquo;clear&rdquo; or &ldquo;almost clear&rdquo; (43% vs 7%; P=.001), and VAS score (2 vs 5; P=.0079) at week 4. BSA and QoL improvements were also observed. Most efficacy assessments worsened after withdrawing Cal/BD foam for 8 weeks but recovered after reinitiating Cal/BD foam from week 12 to week 16. Cal/BD foam plus apremilast appeared to be safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of moderate plaque psoriasis, Cal/BD foam plus apremilast provided more benefits than with apremilast alone. These improvements appeared to be lost when Cal/BD foam was withdrawn but recovered when Cal/BD foam was reinitiated.

Methods We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical data of 9 pathologically confirmed FDCS cases in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2005 to December 2018.Immunohistochemical staining of IgG and IgG4 were performed,and Epstein-Barr virus(EBV)-encoded RNA(EBER)in situ hybridization were carried out. Results Nine cases of FDCS included 4 men and 5 women aged 16-53 years [mean(38.2±9.7)years].The clinical manifestations included masses,lymph node enlargement,rash,and fever.The tumors were located in lymph node,retroperitoneal region,adrenal gland,neck,axillary region,and liver,respectively.Ultrasound showed clear boundary cystic or solid mass with maximum diameters of 1.5-15.0 cm.Microscopically,the spindle tumor cells were arranged in solid and storiform patterns with abundant and slightly stained cytoplasm,vacuolated nuclei,and small nucleoli.The mitosis was 1-3/10 high power fields,and necrosis was found in 5 cases.Immunohistochemically,the tumor cells were positive for CD21(6/9),CD35(6/9),and CD23(7/9). Conclusions FDCS is a rare malignant tumor,which is easy to be missed.The combination of CD21,CD35,and CD23 is helpful for diagnosis.Hyaline-vascular type Castleman's disease may be the precursor of FDCS,and there may be only a small number of IgG4-positive plasma cells in FDCS.Surgical resection remains the main treatment for FDCS.;None;0.5;0.4;0.4;;32895103;;;;

There are very few described cases of FDCS arising in the chest wall. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 44-year-old male patient presented with a history of right chest wall pain for 5 months. DIAGNOSES: Positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed a significant increase in F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and multiple small axillary lymph nodes without hypermetabolic lesions. Immunohistochemistry results of a core-needle biopsy indicated FDCS, which was consistent with the postoperative pathological examination. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent tumor resection with lymphadenectomy of level I axillary nodes. No metastasis in the lymph nodes was observed in the postoperative pathological examination. The patient did not accept chemotherapy or radiotherapy. OUTCOMES: After 18 months, the patient remains in good condition with no evidence of disease recurrence. LESSONS: This report highlights a rare case of a FDCS arising in the chest wall. Accurate clinical diagnosis and staging of this rare malignant sarcoma is essential for the developmnt of effective treatment strategies. Preoperative F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography scanning combined with core-needle biopsy could provide differentiation between benign and malignant tumors, as well as lymph node involvement and metastatic status.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/MD.0000000000021935;2.1;2.7;2.7;;32871936;;;;

Such exposure might have implications on cross-resistance to dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapies (ART). Case presentation: We report a 65 years old Cameroonian, previously exposed to raltegravir, and failing on third-line treatment with multi-drug resistance to darunavir/r and dolutegravir. Genotypic resistance testing (GRT) and viral tropism were performed during monitoring time points. The patient initiated ART in August 2007. At the time point of the first (29.04.2010), second (01.12.2017) and third (08.08.2019) GRT, prior ART exposure included 3TC, d4T, NVP and EFV; additionally TDF, DRV/r and RAL; and additionally ABC and DTG respectively. First GRT revealed mutations associated with resistance only to first-generation Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Second GRT revealed mutations associated with high-level resistance to all NRTIs, first generation NNRTIs, all ritonavir boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r), and all INSTI, while viral tropism (using geno2pheno) revealed a CCR5-tropic virus with a false positive rate (FPR) of 60.9% suggesting effectiveness of maraviroc (MRV). The third GRT showed high-level resistance to NRTI, NNRTI, all PI and all INSTI, with additional mutations (H221HY for NNRTI and S147G for INSTI), and a CCR5-tropic virus with a slightly reduced FPR (57.0%). Without any locally available active therapeutic option, the patient has been on a maintenance therapy with ""DRV/r (600mg x 2/day)+TDF+3TC""and patient/family-centered adherence has been reinforced. Since the first viral load (VL) measurement in 2010, the patient has had 12 VL tests with the VL ranging from 4.97 Log to 6.44 Log copies/mL and the CD4 count never exceeded 200 cells/L.

Objectives: To evaluate safety of 4 weeks’ treatment with Cal/BD foam in adolescent patients with psoriasis, and additional safety outcomes in patients with more severe disease (HPA-axis cohort). Primary objectives included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and systemic calcium levels in the overall population, and HPA-axis function, change in calcium excretion and the calcium:creatinine ratio in the HPA-axis cohort. Secondary objectives included exploratory efficacy endpoints [treatment success: change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)]. Systemic exposure to Cal/BD was also assessed. Methods: A phase II, open-label, study (NCT02387853) in patients (12 to <17 years) with at least mild psoriasis, to evaluate Cal/BD foam applied once daily for 4 weeks. Results: In patients assigned to treatment (n = 106), 32 TEAEs occurred in 22 patients (20.8%). All but two TEAEs were mild; none led to study withdrawal or death. Changes (0–4 weeks) in albumin-corrected serum calcium (overall population) and urinary calcium excretion (HPA-axis cohort) were small, transient and not considered clinically relevant. In the HPA-axis cohort, no change in urinary calcium:creatinine ratio was observed and responses to adrenocorticotropic–hormone (ACTH) challenge did not suggest disruption of the HPA-axis. Prespecified treatment success on the body and scalp was achieved by 71.8% and 75.7% of the overall population, respectively. Mean PASI decreased by 82.0% vs. baseline at Week 4. Systemic exposure to Cal/BD was minimal. Conclusions: Cal/BD foam was well tolerated in adolescent patients with body/scalp psoriasis. There was no evidence for dysregulation of the HPA-axis nor calcium homoeostasis in patients with more severe disease. Exploratory efficacy data in the overall population were encouraging.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jdv.16233;6.8;7.3;6.6;;32074665;;;;

This study addressed a novel method for inactivating Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the causative agent of WNS, using ultraviolet A (UVA) or B (UVB) radiation in combination with methoxsalen, a photosensitizer from the furanocoumarin family of compounds. Fungal spore suspensions were diluted in micromolar concentrations of methoxsalen (50–500 M), then exposed to fixed doses of UVA radiation (500–5000 mJ/cm2), followed by plating on germination media. These plates were examined for two to four weeks for evidence of spore germination or inactivation, along with resultant growth or inhibition of P. destructans colonies. Pretreatment of fungal spores with low doses of methoxsalen resulted in a UVA dose-dependent inactivation of the P. destructans spores. All doses of methoxsalen paired with 500 mJ/cm2 of UVA led to an approximate two-log10 (~99%) reduction in spore viability, and when paired with 1000 mJ/cm2, a four-log10 or greater (>99.99%) reduction in spore viability was observed. Additionally, actively growing P. destructans colonies treated directly with methoxsalen and either UVA or UVB radiation demonstrated UV dose-dependent inhibition and termination of colony growth. This novel approach of using a photosensitizer in combination with UV radiation to control fungal growth may have broad, practical application in the future.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239001;5.7;5.4;5.2;;32915896;e0239001;;;

The combination of drugs acting at different targets or mechanisms of action has been recognized as an alternative approach for achieving optimal analgesia. In this study, the analgesic effects of pregabalin (30, 60, 100, 200 mg/kg), curcumin (15, 30, 60, 100, 120 mg/kg), and 1:1 fixed-dose ratio of the pregabalin-curcumin combination were assessed using two acute nociceptive pain models, the acetic acid-induced writhing and tail-flick tests in mice. The pregabalin-curcumin combination produced a dose-dependent decrease in mean of writhes and an increase in the percentage of antinociception by the acetic acid-induced writhing test. In the tail-flick test, the combination also showed an improvement in antinociception indicated by the tail-flick latency, % antinociception, and area under the curve (AUC). Isobolographic analysis of interactions demonstrated a significant synergistic interaction effect between pregabalin and curcumin in both acute nociceptive pain models with the experimental ED50 below the predicted additive line and the combination index < 1. These findings demonstrate that the combination of pregabalin and curcumin exhibits a synergistic interaction in mouse models of acute nociceptive pain.;https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/25/18/4172;4.5;4.1;4.1;;32933086;4172;;;

These cancers, and prostate cancer, are known as BRCA-related malignancies. We evaluated the efficacy of gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GEMOX) in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with a family/personal history of these cancers. Methods: Chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with a family history of pancreatic/breast/ovarian/prostate cancer or a personal history of breast/ovarian/prostate cancer were included. Patients received fixed dose-rate gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) and oxaliplatin (100 mg/m2) every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was 1-year survival, and the threshold and expected values were set at 30 and 50%, respectively. The target sample size was determined to be 43, with a one-sided alpha value of 5% and power of 80%. A total of 45 patients were enrolled. Results: Among the first 43 enrolled patients, the 1-year survival rate was 27.9% [90% confidence interval (CI) 17.0–41.3], which did not meet the primary endpoint. Median overall survival, progression-free survival, and response rates were 7.6 months (95% CI 6.0–10.7), 4.0 months (95% CI 2.0–4.6), and 26.7% (95% CI 14.6–41.9), respectively, in all registered patients. The GEMOX regimen was generally tolerated; the most common grade three or higher adverse events were hematological toxicities. Conclusion: GEMOX did not show the expected efficacy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with a family or personal history of pancreatic/breast/ovarian/prostate cancer. Selection of GEMOX based on family/personal history is not recommended. Trial registration number: UMIN000017894.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10147-020-01721-x;4.2;4.8;4.5;;32535711;;;;

Among these, multimodal analgesic regimens stand out as a promising treatment options. Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitor/opioid receptor agonist combinations hold great potential as effective pillars in the multimodal pain management by providing adequate analgesia with fewer safety risks due to COX inhibitors’ opioid-sparing effect. Thus, these combinations, either freely or in fixed-dose formulation, offer a feasible option for the prescribing clinicians who seek to maximise therapeutic effect while simultaneously minimise adverse effects. The selection of the appropriate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and opioid agent at optimal doses is essential. It should be tailored to the patients’ analgesic necessities, and his/her gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk, and potential concurrent aspirin use. Moreover, it should allow for addiction risk and the potential opioid-induced bowel dysfunction and constipation. To ensure an optimal match between the characteristics of the patient and the properties of the chosen medication, and to guide adequate and well-tolerated treatment decisions, it is of paramount importance to expand clinicians’ knowledge of the currently available COX inhibitor/opioid receptor agonist combinations.

Such an issue is exacerbated by the continuously increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs), which results in enforcing novel approaches in the grid operations management. However, from being an issue, the increase of EVs may turn to be a solution to several power system challenges. In this context, a crucial role is played by the so-called vehicle-to-grid (V2G) mode of operation, which has the potential to provide ancillary services to the power grid, such as peak clipping, load shifting, and frequency regulation. More in detail, EVs have recently started to be effectively used for one of the most traditional frequency regulation approaches: the so-called frequency droop control (FDC). This is a primary frequency regulation, currently obtained by adjusting the active power of generators in the main grid. Because to the decommissioning of traditional power plants, EVs are thus recognized as particularly valuable solutions since they can respond to frequency deviation signals by charging or discharging their batteries. Against this background, we address frequency regulation of a power grid model including loads, traditional generators, and several EVs. The latter independently participate in the grid optimization process providing the grid with ancillary services, namely the FDC. We propose two novel control strategies for the optimal control of the batteries of EVs during the frequency regulation service. On the one hand, the control strategies ensure re-balancing the power and stabilizing the frequency of the main grid. On the other hand, the approaches are able to satisfy different types of needs of EVs during the charging process. Differently from the related literature, where the EVs perspective is generally oriented to achieve the optimal charge level, the proposed approaches aim at minimizing the degradation of battery devices. Finally, the proposed strategies are compared with other state-of-the-art V2G control approaches. The results of numerical experiments using a realistic power grid model show the effectiveness of the proposed strategies under the actual operating conditions.;https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/17/4586;3.1;3.3;3.8;;;4586;;;

Although topical therapies are frequently used to treat mild disease, they are not routinely used to treat patients with moderate-to-severe disease who have a larger proportion of their body surface area (BSA) affected ( 5% BSA). Based on well-controlled trials in adults with mild-to-severe disease, fixed-dose combination calcipotriol 50 g/g + betamethasone dipropionate 0.5 mg/g (Cal/BD) cutaneous foam has been approved (Enstilar®, LEO Pharma) in the USA and EU for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris for up to 4 weeks in adults. In this post-hoc subgroup analysis, we used pooled data from phase II/III trials to investigate the efficacy and safety of Cal/BD cutaneous foam in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Methods: Patients included in this analysis had psoriasis affecting 5–15% BSA and a physician’s global assessment (PGA)  3. Endpoints included: treatment success by PGA (rating: clear/almost clear), patient’s global assessment (PaGA) at week 4 (rating: clear/very mild) and safety. Results: A total of 340 patients in the three randomized trials met the BSA/PGA inclusion criteria, of whom 254 were treated with Cal/BD foam and 86 with vehicle foam. Treatment success by PGA and PaGA at week 4 was achieved in 143 (58.1%) and 138 (56.1%) patients receiving Cal/BD foam, respectively, versus three (3.6%) and 14 (16.7%) patients receiving vehicle foam. Sixty-six adverse events (AEs) occurred in 47 (18.5%) patients receiving Cal/BD foam and 11 AEs occurred in 11 (12.8%) patients receiving vehicle foam. Three severe AEs and 15 non-serious treatment-related AEs occurred in patients receiving Cal/BD foam. Conclusion: The results from three clinical trials analyzed together show that topical Cal/BD foam is well tolerated and efficacious for treating patients with moderate-to-severe disease. Data support Cal/BD foam as a potential topical therapy for moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

The high rates of CVD and the need for long-term treatment to decrease risk factors makes cost-effectiveness crucial for their successful long-term implementation. Objective: This study assessed cost-effectiveness studies of novel pharmacological treatments (ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [n-3 PUFAs], and the cardiovascular polypill) compared with standard care for the secondary prevention of CVD. Methods: We searched seven databases and the reference list of selected literature reviews for eligible cost-effective analyses (CEA) published between January 2009 and January 2020 that evaluated the above novel treatments versus standard care. Two independent reviewers performed the screening and evaluation in accordance with the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards statement. Cost results were adapted to 2018 US dollars (US$) to facilitate comparisons between studies. Consideration of cost-effectiveness was based on the original study criteria. Results: Thirty-two studies were included in this review, most of them adopting a healthcare perspective. Studies evaluating ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors and n-3 PUFAs assessed their addition to standard care compared with standard care alone, while studies analysing the polypill evaluated the replacement of multiple monotherapies for a fixed-dose combination. Ten studies reported on ezetimibe, fifteen evaluated PCSK9 inhibitors, five focused on n-3 PUFAs and seven on the polypill. From a healthcare perspective, ezetimibe was cost effective in 62.5% of the studies (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICERs] ranged from US$27,195 to US$204,140), n-3 PUFAs in 60% (ICERs from US$57,128 to US$139,082) and the cardiovascular polypill in 100% (ICERs from dominant to US$30,731) compared with standard care. Conversely, only 10% of the studies considered PCSK9 inhibitors cost effective compared with standard care from a healthcare perspective (ICERs ranged from US$231,119 to US$1,223,831). Additionally, ezetimibe was cost effective in 50% of the studies, PCSK9 inhibitors in 33% and the polypill in 50% of the studies adopting a societal perspective. The key model-related parameters predicting cost-effectiveness included drug cost, time horizon, and the baseline risk of cardiovascular events. Conclusions: Based on current pricing and willingness-to-pay thresholds, most CEA studies considered ezetimibe, n-3 PUFAs and the polypill to be cost effective compared with standard care but not PCSK9 inhibitors for secondary prevention of CVD.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40273-020-00936-0;6.3;6.3;6.0;;32583316;;;;

The primary objective of this phase I study was to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of metformin in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with ovarian cancer. Secondary objectives were to describe safety and pharmacokinetics. Methods In this single-center trial the RP2D of metformin in combination with carboplatin area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) 6 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks (q3w) in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer was determined using a 3 + 3 escalation rule at three fixed dose levels: 500 mg three times daily (tds), 850 mg tds and 1000 mg tds. Metformin was commenced on day 3 of cycle 1 and continued until 3 weeks after the last chemotherapy administration. The RP2D was defined as the dose level at which 0 of 3 or  1 of 6 evaluable subjects experienced a metformin-related dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Safety was assessed according to CTCAE v4.0. Plasma and serum samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses were collected during treatment cycles 1 and 2. Results Fifteen patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and an indication for neo-adjuvant (n = 5) or palliative (n = 10) treatment were included. No DLTs were observed. Three patients discontinued study treatment during cycle 1 for other reasons than DLT. Six patients were treated at the RP2D of metformin 1000 mg tds. The most frequent low-grade toxicities were anemia, hypomagnesemia and diarrhea. Grade 3 adverse events (AEs) occurred in ten patients, most common were leucopenia (n = 4), thrombocytopenia (n = 3) and increased GGT (n = 3). There were no grade 4 AEs. Metformin increased the platinum (Pt) AUC (22%, p = 0.013) and decreased the Pt clearance (-28%, p = 0.013). Metformin plasma levels were all within the therapeutic range for diabetic patients (0.1–4 mg/L). Conclusion The RP2D of metformin in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in advanced ovarian cancer is 1000 mg tds. This is higher than the RP2D reported for combination with targeted agents. A potential PK interaction of metformin with carboplatin was identified.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10637-020-00920-7;7.5;6.0;5.0;;32146550;;;;

Therefore, this study aims to determine the burden of metabolic syndrome among patients living with HIV/AIDS at referral hospitals of Northwest Ethiopia. Materials and methods: a hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted at referral hospitals of Northwest Ethiopia between February 2019 and April 2019. Using the WHO stepwise approach, sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical data were collected from 407 adult patients. Lipid profiles, fasting blood sugar, as well as anthropometric indicators, were also measured. In addition, multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was found to be 24.6% (95 CI: 20.42,28.78). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age [AOR (95% CI) 1.04 (1.003,1.074), p < 0.05]; female gender [AOR (95% CI) 9.66 (4.40, 21.22), p < 0.05]; marital status, single referent, separated [AOR (95% CI) 4.77 (1.83, 12.41), p < 0.05] and widowed [AOR (95% CI) 3.868(1.375, 10.883), p < 0.05]; monthly income (<2000 Ethiopian Birr referent) > 5000 ETB [AOR (95% CI) 3.543 (1.299, 9.664), p < 0.05]; and urban residence [AOR (95% CI) 2.118 (1.089, 4.119), p < 0.05] have shown statistically significant association with odds of metabolic syndrome. Conclusion: The burden of metabolic syndrome was notably higher. Age, gender, marital status, monthly income, residence, waist circumference, and hypertension of patients were significantly associated with metabolic syndrome.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1871402120303052;2.6;3.1;2.6;S1871402120303052;32947754;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1871402120303052;;

Using ex vivo cocultures of FL patient biopsies and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) to mimic the germinal center (n 5 42), we uncovered that PI3Kd inhibition interferes with FDC-induced genes related to angiogenesis, extracellular matrix formation, and transendothelial migration in a subset of FL samples, defining an 18-gene signature fingerprint of idelalisib sensitivity. A common hallmark of idelalisib found in all FL cases was its interference with the CD40/CD40L pathway and induced proliferation, together with the downregulation of proteins crucial for B–T-cell synapses, leading to an inefficient cross talk between FL cells and the supportive T-follicular helper cells (TFH). Moreover, idelalisib downmodulates the chemokine CCL22, hampering the recruitment of TFH and immunosupressive T-regulatory cells to the FL niche, leading to a less supportive and tolerogenic immune microenvironment. Finally, using BH3 profiling, we uncovered that FL–FDC and FL–macrophage cocultures augment tumor addiction to BCL-XL and MCL-1 or BFL-1, respectively, limiting the cytotoxic activity of the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax. Idelalisib restored FL dependence on BCL-2 and venetoclax activity. In summary, idelalisib exhibits a patient-dependent activity toward angiogenesis and lymphoma dissemination. In all FL cases, idelalisib exerts a general reshaping of the FL immune microenvironment and restores dependence on BCL-2, predisposing FL to cell death, providing a mechanistic rationale for investigating the combination of PI3Kd inhibitors and venetoclax in clinical trials.;https://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article/4/17/4217/463651/PI3K%CE%B4-inhibition-reshapes-follicular;0;1.0;4.0;;32898249;;;;

Decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor approved for the treatment of MDS and CMML, is degraded by cytidine deaminase in the gastrointestinal tract and liver, thereby limiting oral bioavailability. Cedazuridine is a proprietary, patented cytidine deaminase inhibitor that, when added to decitabine, increases oral bioavailability of the drug. In July 2020, decitabine/cedazuridine received its first approval in the USA and Canada for the treatment of MDS and CMML. In the USA, it is indicated for use in adults with MDS and CMML, including previously treated and untreated, de novo and secondary MDS with the following French–American–British subtypes (refractory anaemia, refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory anaemia with excess blasts and CMML) and intermediate-1, intermediate-2 and high-risk International Prognostic Scoring System groups. Clinical studies for AML, glioma and solid tumours are underway in several countries worldwide. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of decitabine/cedazuridine leading to this first approval for the treatment of MDS and CMML.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40265-020-01389-7;9.4;9.2;9.6;;32860582;;;;

In this study, as part of the larger HIV Organ Policy Equity pilot study, HIV-positive to HIV-positive kidney and liver transplant recipients in the USA were examined for evidence of sustained donor-derived HIV superinfection. Methods: In this multicentre, prospective, observational study, HIV-positive to HIV-positive kidney and liver transplant recipients were followed in three hospitals in the USA. Candidates with well controlled HIV infection on ART, no active opportunistic infections, and minimum CD4 T-cell counts (>100 cells per L for liver and >200 cells per L for kidney per federal guidelines) were eligible to receive a kidney or liver from deceased HIV-positive donors without active infections or neoplasm. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from donor–recipient pairs at the time of transplantation, and from recipients at several timepoints up to 3 years after transplantation. Donor samples were assessed for HIV RNA viral load, CD4 cell count, and antiretroviral drug-resistant mutations. Donor and recipient HIV proviral DNA, and viral RNA from the viraemic timepoint were sequenced using a site-directed next-generation sequencing assay for the reverse transcriptase and gp41 genes. Neighbour-joining phylogenetic trees and direct sequence comparison were used to detect the presence of HIV superinfection. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02602262. Findings: 14 HIV-positive to HIV-positive kidney and eight liver transplant recipients were followed from March, 2016, to July, 2019. 17 recipients had adequate viral sequences allowing for HIV superinfection assessment. Eight donors were suppressed (viral load <400 copies per mL), and none had multiclass drug-resistant mutations detected. None of the recipients examined had evidence of HIV superinfection. One recipient had a viraemic episode (viral load of 2 080 000 copies per mL) 3 years after transplantation as a result of non-adherence to ART. Only recipient viral sequences were detected during the viraemic episode, suggesting that the donor virus, if present, was not reactivated despite temporary withdrawal of ART. Interpretation: These findings suggest that loss of HIV suppression due to donor-derived HIV superinfection might not be a significant clinical concern in carefully monitored ART suppressed HIV-positive organ recipients.

Crushing can alter drug exposure, possibly leading to treatment failure, development of resistance or toxicity. Currently, there is no information about crushing of the fixed-dose combination tablet of elbasvir/grazoprevir; therefore, crushing of this tablet is not recommended. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the influence of crushing on the pharmacokinetics of the elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed-dose combination tablet. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, two-period, randomized, cross-over, Phase I, single-dose trial in 11 healthy adult volunteers. Subjects randomly received whole-tablet elbasvir/grazoprevir or crushed and suspended elbasvir/grazoprevir in a fasted state. Pharmacokinetic similarity criteria (90% CIs lie within 70%-143% acceptance range) were used for AUC0- and AUC0-72. RESULTS: Mean plasma concentration-time curves of elbasvir and grazoprevir showed similar pharmacokinetic profiles. The primary pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0- and AUC0-72 of elbasvir and grazoprevir after intake of a crushed tablet were on average 12%-16% higher compared with the whole tablet, but 90% CIs were all within the predefined boundaries of pharmacokinetic similarity. Crushing leads to a higher Cmax of grazoprevir (42%); no significant difference was found between treatments with regard to the Cmax of elbasvir. No serious adverse events were reported during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetic similarity could be demonstrated for a crushed and suspended tablet compared with a whole tablet, without impacting drug safety or efficacy. Crushed and suspended administration of elbasvir/grazoprevir can be used in patients with swallowing disorders.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/9/2661/5858197;8.7;7.7;8.3;;32544221;;;;

A number of individualized combination regimens can be created, including nonopioid agents such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and adjunctive agents such as gabapentin, pregabalin, and muscle relaxants. Areas covered: When such combinations have a synergistic effect, analgesic benefits may be enhanced. Many combination analgesic regimens are opioid sparing, which sometimes but not always results in reduced opioid-associated side effects. Safety concerns for all analgesics must be considered but postoperative analgesia is typically administered for a brief period (days), reducing risks that may occur with prolonged exposure. Expert opinion: Judiciously considered combination analgesic regimens can be effective postoperative analgesics that reduce opioid consumption without compromising pain control, which are important factors for patient recovery and satisfaction. The specific combinations used must be based on the patient, the type and duration of the surgical procedure, and complementary mechanisms of action of the agents used. In opioid-sparing combination analgesic regimens, the short-term use of small doses of opioids in this setting may be helpful for appropriate patients.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14737175.2020.1806058;5.5;6.0;6.2;;32749896;;;;

Recent Findings: Many people require multiple blood pressure lowering medicines to achieve target blood pressures, and initiating treatment with combination blood pressure lowering therapy is being increasingly investigated and recommended. Low-dose combinations of blood pressure lowering provide more effective blood pressure lowering, with fewer adverse events. Recent advances include listing of four dual combinations on the WHO Essential Medicines List, completion of a triple half-dose combination trial, and a pilot of quadruple quarter-dose combination, and recent cardiovascular polypill trials have included two blood pressure lowering medicines at low dose. These trials all demonstrated improvements in achieving blood pressure targets with low-dose combination therapy. Summary: Low-dose combination therapy is a promising option for initial treatment of hypertension that appears to be safe and effective. Larger trials of triple and quadruple low-dose combination therapy in multiple locations are underway and should provide stronger evidence of efficacy as well as information on the side effect profile.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11906-020-01069-7;5.3;5.5;6.0;;32852644;65;;;

Restrictions on TT recommendations have primarily been driven by higher pneumonia risk associated with regular ICS use. Evidence suggests that TT is overprescribed, which may affect economic and clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To compare health plan-paid costs, COPD exacerbations, and pneumonia diagnoses among patients newly treated with a LAMA+LABA regimen composed of tiotropium (TIO)+olodaterol (OLO) in a fixed-dose combination inhaler (TIO+OLO) or TT in a U.S. Medicare Advantage Part D insured population. METHODS: This retrospective study identified COPD patients aged 40 years who were initiating TIO+OLO or TT (index regimen) between January 1, 2014, and March 31, 2018, from a national administrative claims database. Continuous insurance coverage for 12 months pretreatment (baseline) and 30 days posttreatment (follow-up) was required. Patients were followed until the earliest of study end (May 31, 2018), discontinuation of index regimen (60-day gap in index regimen coverage), switch to a different regimen, or health plan disenrollment. Before analysis of outcomes, TIO+OLO and TT patients were 1:1 propensity score-matched on baseline demographics, comorbidities, COPD medication use, medical resource use, and costs. Cohort differences in post-match outcomes were assessed by Wald Z-test (annualized costs) and Kaplan-Meier method (time to first COPD exacerbation and pneumonia diagnosis). RESULTS: After matching, each cohort had 1,454 patients who were well balanced on baseline characteristics. Compared with TT, the TIO+OLO cohort incurred $7,041 (41.1%) lower mean COPD-related total costs ($10,094 vs. $17,135; P<0.001); cohort differences in the medical component ($3,666 lower for TIO+OLO) were driven by lower mean acute inpatient costs ($3,053 lower for TIO+OLO). Combined mean COPD plus pneumonia-related medical costs were $5,212 (39.0%) lower for TIO+OLO versus TT ($8,209 vs. $13,421; P=0.006), and total mean all-cause costs were $9,221 (30.4%) lower for TIO+OLO versus TT ($21,062 vs. $30,283; P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis found longer time to first severe COPD exacerbation (P=0.020) and first pneumonia diagnosis (P=0.002) for TIO+OLO versus TT and a lower percentage of TIO+OLO patients experiencing these events (severe COPD exacerbation: 9.0% vs. 16.1%; pneumonia: 14.5% vs. 19.3%). A secondary analysis, which expanded the TIO+OLO cohort to include any LAMA+LABA regimen, had similar findings for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: COPD patients initiating TIO+OLO incurred lower costs to health plans and experienced fewer COPD exacerbation and pneumonia events relative to TT. These findings provide important real-world economic and clinical insight into the GOLD recommendations for TIO+OLO and LAMA+LABA therapy. The study findings also indicate the continued inconsistency between the recommendations and real-world clinical practices pertaining to TT.";https://www.jmcp.org/doi/10.18553/jmcp.2020.20159;3.6;3.5;3.7;;32678719;;;;

Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 licenseBackground: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up in sub-Saharan Africa combined with weak routine virological monitoring has driven increasing HIV drug resistance. We investigated ART failure, drug resistance, and early mortality among patients with HIV admitted to hospital in Malawi. Methods: This observational cohort study was nested within the rapid urine-based screening for tuberculosis to reduce AIDS-related mortality in hospitalised patients in Africa (STAMP) trial, which recruited unselected (ie, irrespective of clinical presentation) adult (aged 18 years) patients with HIV-1 at admission to medical wards. Patients were included in our observational cohort study if they were enrolled at the Malawi site (Zomba Central Hospital) and were taking ART for at least 6 months at admission. Patients who met inclusion criteria had frozen plasma samples tested for HIV-1 viral load. Those with HIV-1 RNA of at least 1000 copies per mL had drug resistance testing by ultra-deep sequencing, with drug resistance defined as intermediate or high-level resistance using the Stanford HIVDR program. Mortality risk was calculated 56 days from enrolment. Patients were censored at death, at 56 days, or at last contact if lost to follow-up. The modelling strategy addressed the causal association between HIV multidrug resistance and mortality, excluding factors on the causal pathway (most notably, CD4 cell count, clinical signs of advanced HIV, and poor functional and nutritional status). Findings: Of 1316 patients with HIV enrolled in the STAMP trial at the Malawi site between Oct 26, 2015, and Sept 19, 2017, 786 had taken ART for at least 6 months. 252 (32%) of 786 patients had virological failure (viral load 1000 copies per mL). Mean age was 41·5 years (SD 11·4) and 528 (67%) of 786 were women. Of 237 patients with HIV drug resistance results available, 195 (82%) had resistance to lamivudine, 128 (54%) to tenofovir, and 219 (92%) to efavirenz. Resistance to at least two drugs was common (196, 83%), and this was associated with increased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1·7, 95% CI 1·2–2·4; p=0·0042). Interpretation: Interventions are urgently needed and should target ART clinic, hospital, and post-hospital care, including differentiated care focusing on patients with advanced HIV, rapid viral load testing, and routine access to drug resistance testing. Prompt diagnosis and switching to alternative ART could reduce early mortality among inpatients with HIV.

HIV Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British HIV AssociationObjectives: People with HIV (PWHIV) are likely to need therapies for comorbidities as they age. We assessed risk of drug–drug interactions (DDIs) in PWHIV. Methods: The Climate-HIV electronic recording system was used to cross-sectionally analyse records from PWHIV aged  18 years attending four UK HIV units with a current antiretroviral (ARV) prescription in February 2018. Antiretroviral and non-ARV medications were categorized by clinical significance of DDIs (University of Liverpool DDI tool). Potential DDIs were predicted using treatment guidelines for commonly recorded comorbidities. Results: Among 4630 PWHIV (44% female), 41% were  50 years old. The average number of non-ARV comedications increased from < 1 for patients aged  24 years to > 5 for patients aged  75 years; 65% were taking one or more non-ARV comedications. The median (interquartile range) number of non-ARVs was 1 (0–2) and 2 (1–5) for those aged < 50 and  50 years, respectively. Common comorbidities/concurrent health conditions occurred more frequently in patients aged  50 years vs. < 50 (53% vs. 34%). Boosted protease inhibitors were associated with the highest proportion of contraindicated comedications; dolutegravir and raltegravir had the fewest. For non-ARVs, sildenafil and quetiapine were most likely to result in DDIs. Guideline-recommended treatments for hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and tuberculosis had the highest proportions of contraindications when combined with ARV regimens, while treatments for hepatitis C, malignancy, and mental health conditions had the highest proportion of combinations potentially causing DDIs requiring dose monitoring or adjustment. Conclusions: Non-ARV use by PWHIV is high and increases with age. Treatment decisions for ageing PWHIV should consider guideline recommendations for comorbidities.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hiv.12879;5.6;5.3;5.8;;32671950;;;;

Genetic testing was performed to confirm a suspected genetic condition. Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood, and genetic variations of the interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) rs642961 (Mspl) (G>A) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFA) BamHI (rs11466297, A>C) and RsaI (rs3732248, C>T) were performed by PCR-RFLP and IRF6 gene analysis by PCR sequencing. Genotyping of DNA sequence variants in the IRF6 gene showed both parents had genotype GA, while the child had genotype GG (genotype wild type). There was no difference observed in the TGFA BamHI gene variant between the child and her mother and father that were wild-type polymorphisms (normal), while the Rsa1 polymorphisms of them were heterozygotes. A genetic variant of IRF6 might be a protective factor for NSCLP, while Rsa1 gene variant (A) allele can be considered to be the risk factor associated with NSCLP development. This case report also highlights the possible etiologic role of ART in NSCLP; therefore, early control of adverse effects of ART might be an important factor in decreasing the incidence of the congenital anomalies in HIV-infected children.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/odi.13403;4.2;4.0;3.9;;32862534;;;;

Methods: This study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled trial. In total, 50 patients with newly diagnosed T2DM were enrolled from September 2016 to December 2018. Patients were randomized into sequential treatment group (n=25) and control group (n=25). All the patients received SIIT to achieve and maintain glycemic targets (fasting or pre-meal blood glucose 4.4-6.0 mmol/L,2 h post-prandial glucose 4.4-7.8 mmol/L) for 14 days. Afterwards, metformin and pioglitazone fixed dose tablets (metformin 500 mg plus pioglitazone 15 mg per tablet) or placebo were given to the sequential treatment group or the control group respectively at a dose of 1 tablet bid for 3 months. Homeostasis model assessments and indices derived from oral glucose tolerance tests were used to evaluate -cell function [homeostasis model assessment of  cell function (HOMA-), I30 min/G30 min, AUCinsulin/AUCglucose, insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2 (ISSI-2)] and insulin sensitivity [homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), Matsuda index]. The t test or Mann-Whiteney U were used for comparison between groups,and covariance analysis was used for correction of confusions for indicators of islet function or insulin resistance. Results: In both groups,blood glucose levels were remarkably decreased while -cell function and insulin sensitivity were improved after SIIT. At 3 month, -cell indices such as I30 min/G30 min [3.2 (1.9,5.9) vs 2.1 (1.2,4.0), Z=-1.93, P=0.049], ISSI-2 [245.3 (170.5,330.0) vs 158.9 (122.2, 236.9), Z=-2.13, P=0.03] and AUCinsulin/AUCglucose (3.0±1.7 vs 1.9±0.9, F=5.17, P=0.028) and HOMA- (56.9±30.7 vs 36.0±22.5, F=5.25, P=0.037) were significantly higher in the sequential treatment group than the control group, while fasting blood glucose [(6.0±1.0) vs (6.6±1.0) mmol/L, t=-2.04, P=0.048] and glycated hemoglobin A1c [(6.2±1.1)% vs (6.5±0.4)%, t=-2.16, P=0.04] were lower in the sequential treatment group, the differences were all statistically significant. Conclusion: After SIIT, metformin plus pioglitazone as sequential therapy can persistently improve -cell function and maintain optimal blood glucose in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM.;http://journal.yiigle.com/LinkIn.do?linkin_type=DOI&DOI=10.3760/cma.j.cn115791-20200224-00096;0;0;0;;;;;;

Four accurate spectrophotometric methods utilizing ratio spectra were developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of EN and NT in combined pharmaceutical dosage form (Eneas® tablets). The first method was first derivative ratio spectrophotometric method (1DD) where the amplitudes maxima were measured at 219.2 nm and 233.4 nm for the determination of EN and NT, respectively. The second method was ratio difference spectrophotometric method where EN and NT were estimated by measuring the amplitudes difference between 213 nm and 225 nm on the ratio spectrum of EN and between 241 nm and 227 nm on the ratio spectrum of NT. The third method was ratio subtraction followed by extended ratio subtraction, EN was determined at 210 nm by subtraction of the constant values from the ratio spectrum then multiplication with the divisor (NT spectrum). An extended ratio subtraction method was then applied in order to determine NT at 235 nm by using the zero-order spectrum of EN (10 g/ml) as a divisor. The fourth method was ratio subtraction coupled with constant multiplication methods. The zero- order absorption spectrum of the laboratory prepared mixture was divided by NT (12 g/ml) spectrum, subsequently, the value of the constant was multiplied by the divisor to obtain the original spectrum of NT, followed by its subtraction from the laboratory prepared mixture to get the spectrum of EN. EN and NT were determined at 210 nm and 235 nm, respectively. Linearity was ascertained over the concentration ranges of (1–11 g/ml) for EN and (2–14 g/ml) for NT, for the first and second methods and (2–13 g/ml) for EN and (3–20 g/ml) of NT, for the third and fourth methods. Application of the methods to the determination of the cited drugs in Eneas® tablets gave satisfactory results. Methods validation confirmed their accuracy and selectivity. Statistical comparison of the results with the reported one showed no significant difference, regarding precision and accuracy.

Turen is one of the four sub-districts with the highest number of patients with HIV/AIDS in Malang District, Indonesia. The purpose of this study is to determine the sociodemographic profile, sources of infection, use of antiretrovirals and CD4 counts on HIV/AIDS outpatients in Turen Primary Health Centre (PHC). The sociodemographic data, antiretroviral use, and CD4 counts were obtained from medical records on HIV/AIDS outpatients in Turen PHC. A qualitative approach using in-depth interviews was used to explore the source of infection. Descriptive analysis was used to summarise the quantitative data, while thematic analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data derived from interviews. A total of 45 HIV/AIDS outpatient medical records were reviewed. Of those, the majority were females (57.8%), ages 26-35 years (51.1%), married (55.6%) and having income less than 2 million rupiah (73.3%). All of them used a combination of antiretroviral therapy from two classes of antiretrovirals, i.e. nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor and non-nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor; the majority were treated with fixed-dose combination of tenofovir-lamifudin-efavirenz. The CD4 counts data were obtained from 31 patients with an average number of 282 cells/mm3. The qualitative data from interviews with 15 patients revealed that the source of infection was from husband, unsafe/unprotected sex and blood donor. The high prevalence of HIV/AIDS among young married women and poor control of the disease in Indonesia warrants further considerations. The government should work together with all related stakeholders in raising awareness of HIV/AIDS, particularly among women, as well as improving treatment and support for people living with HIV/AIDS.";http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jbcpp.2019.30.issue-6/jbcpp-2019-0259/jbcpp-2019-0259.xml;2.3;2.8;3.0;;31855567;20190259;;;

Objectives: The present study assessed the analgesic efficacy of fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of ibuprofen/acetaminophen (IBU/APAP) compared with ibuprofen 400 mg and placebo. Methods: This 12-h, double-blind, proof-of-concept study compared three FDCs of IBU/APAP (200 mg/500 mg, 250 mg/500 mg, and 300 mg/500 mg) with ibuprofen 400 mg and placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe pain following third molar extraction. The primary endpoint was the time-weighted sum of pain relief and pain intensity difference scores from 0 to 8 h after dosing (SPRID[4]0–8). Time to meaningful pain relief (TMPR), duration of pain relief, and adverse events (AEs) were also assessed. Results: In total, 394 patients were randomized. All active treatments were superior to placebo for SPRID[4]0–8 (all p < 0.001) but not significantly different from ibuprofen 400 mg. Median TMPR with FDCs and ibuprofen (44.5–54.1 and 56.2 min, respectively) was faster than with placebo (> 720 min; all p < 0.001 vs. placebo). Duration of pain relief was similar with the FDCs and ibuprofen 400 mg (9.7 –11.1 h) and longer than with placebo (1.6 h; all p < 0.001). AE incidence was comparable with all treatments. Conclusion: Each IBU/APAP FDC provided analgesic efficacy comparable to that with ibuprofen 400 mg and superior to that with placebo. Each FDC provided MPR in < 1 h, duration of pain relief > 9 h, and tolerability similar to that with ibuprofen and placebo.

Dysfunction of the BBB further potentiates viral replication within the CNS, which can lead to HIV-associated neuropathology. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) significantly improves HIV patient outcomes and reduces mortality rates. However, there has been limited progress in targeting latent viral reservoirs within the CNS, which may eventually lead to rebound viremia. While ART drugs are shown to be effective in attenuating HIV replication in the periphery, the protection of the brain by the BBB offers an isolated sanctuary to harbor HIV and maintains chronic and persistent replication within the CNS. In this review, we elucidate the pathology of the BBB, its ability to potentiate viral replication, as well as current therapies and insufficiencies in treating HIV-infected individuals.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166223620301491;21.6;20.7;19.6;S0166223620301491;32682564;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0166223620301491;;

This trial assessed if patients with sustained low-level HIV-1 viremia on first-line ART benefit from a switch to second-line treatment. Methods and findings This multicenter, parallel-group, open-label, superiority, randomized controlled trial enrolled patients on first-line ART containing non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) with two consecutive VLs 100 copies/mL, with the second VL between 100-999 copies/mL, from eight clinics in Lesotho. Consenting participants were randomly assigned (1:1), stratified by facility, demographic group, and baseline VL, to either switch to second-line ART (switch group) or continued first-line ART (control group; WHO guidelines). The primary endpoint was viral suppression (<50 copies/mL) at 36 weeks. Analyses were by intention to treat, using logistic regression models, adjusted for demographic group and baseline VL. Between August 1, 2017, and August 7, 2019, 137 individuals were screened, of whom 80 were eligible and randomly assigned to switch (n = 40) or control group (n = 40). The majority of participants were female (54 [68%]) with a median age of 42 y (interquartile range [IQR] 35-51), taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine/efavirenz (49 [61%]) and on ART for a median of 5.9 y (IQR 3.3-8.6). At 36 weeks, 22/40 (55%) participants in the switch versus 10/40 (25%) in the control group achieved viral suppression (adjusted difference 29%, 95% CI 8%-50%, p = 0.009). The switch group had significantly higher probability of viral suppression across different VL thresholds (<20, <100, <200, <400, and <600 copies/mL) but not for <1,000 copies/mL. Thirty-four (85%) participants in switch group and 21 (53%) in control group experienced at least one adverse event (AE) (p = 0.002). No hospitalization or death or other serious adverse events were observed. Study limitations include a follow-up period too short to observe differences in clinical outcomes, missing values in CD4 cell counts due to national stockout of reagents during the study, and limited generalizability of findings to other than NNRTI-based first-line ART regimens. Conclusions In this study, switching to second-line ART among patients with sustained low-level HIV-1 viremia resulted in a higher proportion of participants with viral suppression. These results endorse lowering the threshold for virologic failure in future WHO guidelines.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003325;14.1;15.5;15.5;;32936795;1003325;;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In the last decade, reliable scientific evidence has emerged to support the concept that undetectable viral loads prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Undetectable equals untransmissible (U = U) is a simple message that everyone can understand. The success of this concept depends on strict adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the attainment of suppressed viral loads (VLs). To achieve U = U in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), poor adherence to ART, persistent low-level viremia, and the emergence of drug-resistant mutants are challenges that cannot be overlooked. Short of a cure for HIV, U = U can substantially reduce the burden and change the landscape of HIV epidemiology on the continent. From a public health perspective, the U = U concept will reduce stigmatization in persons living with HIV (PLWHIV) in SSA and strengthen public opinion to accept that HIV infection is not a death sentence. This will also promote ART adherence because PLWHIV will aim to achieve U = U within the shortest possible time. This article highlights challenges and barriers to achieving U = U and suggests how to promote the concept to make it beneficial and applicable in SSA. This concept, if expertly packaged by policy-makers, clinicians, health service providers, and HIV control programs, will help to stem the tide of the epidemic in SSA.;https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/17/6163;3.2;3.1;3.0;;32854292;6163;;;

DESIGN: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTS). METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review by searching PubMed, CINAHL, Global Health, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and four clinical trial databases from 1 January 1980 to 28 April 2018. We included RCTs of antenatal ART regimens in HIV-positive pregnant women, which assessed preterm birth (PTB), spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB), very preterm birth (VPTB), low birthweight (LBW), very low birthweight (VLBW), small-for-gestational-age (SGA), neonatal death (NND), and mother-to-child-transmission. We used random-effects network meta-analysis models to calculate relative risks for treatment comparisons and the hierarchy of treatments. RESULTS: Of 83 260 citations identified, 10 manuscripts were included, assessing 6285 women. Compared with zidovudine (ZDV) monotherapy, we found a higher risk of LBW after exposure to zidovudine/lamivudine/efavirenz (ZDV/3TC/EFV; relative risk 1.61; 95% CI 1.03-2.51), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine/ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (TDF/FTC/LPV/r; 1.64; 1.18-2.29), or zidovudine/lamivudine/ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (ZDV/3TC/LPV/r; 1.87; 1.58-2.20). TDF/FTC/LPV/r carried an increased risk of VLBW, compared with ZDV monotherapy (5.40; 1.08-27.08). ZDV/3TC/LPV/r posed a higher risk of PTB than ZDV monotherapy (1.43; 1.08-1.91) and a higher risk of sPTB than zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir (ZDV/3TC/ABC) (1.81; 1.21-2.71). LPV/r-containing regimens also carried the highest risks of VPTB, SGA and NND, although the limited data showed no significant differences. CONCLUSION: Of the ART regimens assessed in RCTs in pregnancy, LPV/r-containing regimens were associated with the highest risks of adverse perinatal outcomes.";https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAD.0000000000002593;8.8;7.1;7.5;;32701581;;;;

A planned 3-month analysis demonstrated the superiority of netarsudil/latanoprost FDC over its individual active components at every assessment. Herein, the 12-month efficacy and safety of netarsudil/latanoprost FDC are reported. DESIGN: Double-masked, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group trial. PARTICIPANTS: Patients had unmedicated IOP >20 to <36 mmHg in both eyes at 8:00 am and met other standard criteria for OAG or OHT. METHODS: Randomization to once-daily netarsudil 0.02%/latanoprost 0.005% FDC (n = 238), netarsudil 0.02% only (n = 243), or latanoprost 0.005% only (n = 237). Patients instilled study drug into each eye between 8:00 pm and 10:00 pm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: IOP was obtained at 8:00 am, 10:00 am, and 4:00 pm on day 1 (baseline); at weeks 2 and 6; and at months 3, 6, 9, and 12. Ocular and systemic safety were evaluated up to month 12. RESULTS: Netarsudil/latanoprost FDC maintained statistically superior IOP lowering compared to its components at every assessment for 12 months. Least squares mean diurnal IOP (± standard error) at month 12 was 16.2 ± 0.23 mmHg for netarsudil/latanoprost FDC, 17.9 ± 0.20 mmHg for netarsudil, and 17.6 ± 0.18 mmHg for latanoprost (P < 0.05 for netarsudil/latanoprost FDC versus each comparator). The safety profile of netarsudil/latanoprost FDC was consistent with its individual components. The proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE) was 82.8% (197/238) in the netarsudil/latanoprost FDC group, 78.2% (190/243) in the netarsudil group, and 54.0% (128/237) in the latanoprost group. The most common AE was conjunctival hyperemia, mostly of mild severity, with an incidence of 63.0% in the netarsudil/latanoprost FDC treatment group compared with 51.4% in the netarsudil group and 21.9% in the latanoprost group. CONCLUSIONS: Results at 12 months revealed superior efficacy for netarsudil/latanoprost FDC compared with the individual components, netarsudil and latanoprost, at every time point assessed and an ocular tolerability profile similar to that of netarsudil alone.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589419620301575;0;0;0;S2589419620301575;32768361;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2589419620301575;;

Objectives: To assess hepatorenal abnormalities in HIV-infected persons on HAART in a hospital-based mixed cohort study using concurrent and nonconcurrent data analysis. Methods: Hepatorenal function tests, urinalysis and ultrasonogaphy for liver/kidneys (when applicable) were assessed in 400 (men 185; women 215) persons aged 2-84 (mean 47.8) years on HAART. Acute liver toxicity, acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease were defined depending upon abnormal serum alanine aminotransferase, urea and creatinine levels/clearance as per standard guidelines. Results: The duration of HAART was 1 month to 9 years (mean 3.7 years) with 284 (71%) individuals being on treatment for 5years. The major HAART regimens included zidovudine + lamivudine + nevirapine in 175 (43.8%), tenofovir + lamivudine + efavirenz in 174 (43.5%) and zidovudine + lamivudine + efavirenz in 20 (5%) individuals and were associated with grade-1 hepatic dysfunction in 57 (14.3%) individuals, with men aged between 31 and 45 years on antiretroviral therapy for >5 years being mainly affected. Forty two (17.1%) of 246 individuals with anemia and 15 (9.7%) of 154 individuals without anemia showed hepatic dysfunction. None had acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease or abnormal urinalysis or ultrasonography. In contrast, the pretreatment elevated serum alanine amiotranerase in 99 (22.3%) and blood urea and/or creatinine levels in 16 (4%) individuals decreased significantly post highly active antiretroviral therapy. Conclusions: The study reflects the low frequency of regimen based highly active antiretroviral therapy-associated hepatic or nephrotoxicity despite prolonged use, especially in the absence of other risk factors. Preexisting anemia appears an important risk factor for highly active antiretroviral therapy-induced hepatotoxicity (OR 1.90, Cl 95% CI 1.02-3.57, P = 0.04). Highly active antiretroviral therapy-associated nephrotoxicity was not a significant problem.

This non-randomized dose-finding phase I–II study was designed to assess the safety and feasibility of HIPEC, following systemic chemotherapy, in patients with gastric cancer and limited peritoneal dissemination. The maximum tolerated dose of normothermic intraperitoneal docetaxel in combination with a fixed dose of intraperitoneal oxaliplatin was also explored. Methods: Patients with resectable cT3–cT4a gastric adenocarcinoma with limited peritoneal metastases and/or tumour-positive peritoneal cytology were included. An open HIPEC technique was used with 460 mg/m2 hyperthermic oxaliplatin for 30 min followed by normothermic docetaxel for 90 min in escalating doses (0, 50, 75 mg/m2). Results: Between 2014 and 2017, 37 patients were included. Of 25 patients who completed the full study protocol, four were treated at dose level 1 (0 mg/m2 docetaxel), six at dose level 2 (50 mg/m2) and four at dose level 3 (75 mg/m2). At dose level 3, two dose-limiting toxicities occurred, both associated with postoperative ileus. Thereafter, another 11 patients were treated at dose level 2, with no more dose-limiting toxicities. Based on this, the maximum tolerated dose was 50 mg/m2 intraperitoneal docetaxel. Serious adverse events were scored in 17 of 25 patients. The reoperation rate was 16 per cent (4 of 25) and the treatment-related mortality rate was 8 per cent (2 patients, both in dose level 3). Conclusion: Gastrectomy combined with cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC was feasible using 460 mg/m2 oxaliplatin and 50 mg/m2 normothermic docetaxel.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/bjs.11588;9.7;8.8;8.3;;;;;;

In this Phase I, randomised, single-centre, single-dose, two-period, crossover study (NCT03740373), 10 healthy male adults received two actuations of BGF MDI (160/7.2/4.8 g per actuation) radiolabelled with 99mTc, not exceeding 5 MBq per actuation. Immediately following each inhalation, subjects performed a 10- or 3-second breath-hold, then exhaled into an exhalation filter. The primary objective was to assess the pulmonary deposition of BGF MDI following the 10-second breath-hold. The secondary objectives were to assess deposition after the 3-second breath-hold and lung regional and extrathoracic deposition after each breath-hold length. Imaging of the lungs, stomach, head and neck was recorded by gamma scintigraphy immediately after exhalation. The mean BGF MDI emitted dose deposited in the lungs was 37.7% for the 10-second breath-hold and 34.5% for the 3-second breath-hold. Emitted dose detected in the exhalation filter was 0.4% for both breath-hold lengths. The mean normalised peripheral/central ratio was 0.65 and 0.75 for the 10- and 3-second breath-holds, respectively, while the standardised central/peripheral ratios were 1.79 and 1.40, respectively. There were no new or unexpected safety findings. In conclusion, BGF MDI was efficiently deposited in the central and the peripheral regions of the lungs, with similar regional deposition patterns following a 10- and 3-second breath-hold.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S092809872030261X;5.7;5.4;6.6;S092809872030261X;32682074;105472;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S092809872030261X;;

Azadirachta indica and Ocimum sanctum aqueous extracts were prepared based on ayurvedic principles, tested for phytochemicals, and examined for biofilm inhibiting potential on methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains alone or in fixed-dose combination. Both Azadirachta indica and Ocimum sanctum extracts were detected with alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, sugars and protein. The crude extracts maximally inhibited biofilm formation of MRSA1 at 60-70%. The concentrated extract of Azadirachta indica dose-dependently inhibited the biofilm formation of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and –resistant S. aureus strains (MRSA1 and MRSA2) with maximum inhibition of 67, 50 and 45% respectively. Likewise, Ocimum sanctum extract also exhibited maximum biofilm inhibition of 48, 35 and 45% respectively. Further, combination of the concentrated extracts of Azadirachta indica and Ocimum sanctum exhibited a very significant biofilm inhibition of > 80% in both sensitive and resistant strains. The combination of Azadirachta indica and Ocimum sanctum extracts prepared as per ayurvedic principles is effective in inhibiting biofilm formation of MSSA and MRSA. This finding may also be experimented further with pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acetanobacter baumanii for anti-biofilm activity. Also, this combination can be used as an organic disinfectant in place of synthetic sanitizers since the former can eradicate the pathogens colonized in the environmental surfaces to avoid co-infection in situations like COVID-19 pandemic.";http://www.ijpronline.com/ViewArticleDetail.aspx?ID=16724;0.2;0.3;0.8;;;;;;

We examined the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of EFV 600 mg/d during pregnancy and post partum to inform EFV dosing decisions in pregnant women. Methods: Ghanaian pregnant women with HIV infection initiating tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg/lamivudine 300 mg/EFV 600 mg fixed-dose combination tablet once daily were enrolled. Efavirenz concentrations were measured at 4 weeks of antiretroviral therapy initiation during pregnancy and 6 weeks post partum using validated LC-MS/MS assays. Efavirenz PK parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis, and within-group parameters between the 2 periods were compared. Findings: Of 25 enrolled women, 19 completed PK sampling during pregnancy and post partum. The Cmax, Cmin, AUC0–24h, and CL/F for EFV during pregnancy were similar to values at 6 weeks post partum. The pregnancy/postpartum geometric mean ratios for EFV Cmax, Cmin, AUC0–24, and CL/F were 1.10 (95% CI, 0.93–1.31), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.67–1.17), 0.84 (95% CI, 0.71–0.98), and 1.20 (95% CI, 1.02–1.40), respectively. Viral load suppression (HIV RNA <200 copies/mL) was achieved in 16 of 17 participants (94%) by the time of delivery. There was 1 maternal-to-child transmission. Implications: We found that the PK parameters of EFV 600 mg once daily during pregnancy were similar to those in the postpartum period. Our findings suggest that EFV dose adjustment during pregnancy is not necessary in our study population.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0149291820303428;5.6;5.9;5.4;S0149291820303428;32811669;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0149291820303428;;

Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Neurological AssociationObjective: To evaluate the efficacy of a fixed-dose combination of two approved drugs, Ciprofloxacin and Celecoxib, as a potential therapeutic treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Methods: Toxicity and efficacy of Ciprofloxacin and Celecoxib were tested, each alone and in distinct ratio combinations in SOD1 G93R transgenic zebrafish model for ALS. Quantification of swimming measures following stimuli, measurements of axonal projections from the spinal cord, neuromuscular junction structure and morphometric analysis of microglia cells were performed in the combination- treated vs nontreated mutant larvae. Additionally, quantifications of touch-evoked locomotor escape response were conducted in treated vs nontreated zebrafish expressing the TARDBP G348C ALS variant. Results: When administered individually, Ciprofloxacin had a mild effect and Celecoxib had no therapeutic effect. However, combined Ciprofloxacin and Celecoxib (Cipro/Celecox) treatment caused a significant increase of ~ 84% in the distance the SOD1 G93R transgenic larvae swam. Additionally, Cipro/Celecox elicited recovery of impaired motor neurons morphology and abnormal neuromuscular junction structure and preserved the ramified morphology of microglia cells in the SOD1 mutants. Furthermore, larvae expressing the TDP-43 mutation displayed evoked touch responses that were significantly longer in swim distance (110% increase) and significantly higher in maximal swim velocity (~44% increase) when treated with Cipro/Celecox combination. Interpretation: Cipro/Celecox combination improved locomotor and cellular deficits of ALS zebrafish models. These results identify this novel combination as effective, and may prove promising for the treatment of ALS.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acn3.51174;7.5;6.3;5.2;;32915525;;;;

This study sought to investigate the real-world wastage of nivolumab and assess the long-term stability of leftover nivolumab within vials to facilitate drug vial optimization (DVO). METHODS: We collected all discarded vials after preparation from 17 regional hospitals in Japan over a 6-month period preceding the adoption of a fixed dose of 240 mg per administration. The actual amount of waste was measured for each preparation. Stability assessment was performed under different storage conditions. RESULTS: A total of 2,789 100-mg vials and 4,069 20-mg vials were collected. Overall, the drug cost associated with the expenditure of nivolumab alone was $12.1 million, whereas the total cost due to drug wastage was $0.735 million (rate of wastage, 6.1%). Furthermore, the immunoglobulin G concentrations of nivolumab remaining within vials, as well as binding activity to programmed death-1 protein, did not change significantly over 4 weeks of storage at either 4°C or room temperature. CONCLUSION: Significant drug wastage occurs during sterile preparation of nivolumab according to body weight-based dosing. Although nivolumab dosing has been changed to a fixed dose in Japan, body weight-based dosing is still applied in some other countries, as well as in combination therapy with ipilimumab. Our findings regarding the long-term stability of leftover nivolumab within the vials should motivate hospitals to implement DVO for cost savings.;https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JOP.19.00813;0;0;0;;32496875;;;;

Each equipment in the semiconductor manufacturing process is often accompanied by a large amount of sensor readings, also called status variable identification (SVID). Identifying the key SVIDs accurately can make it easier for engineers to monitor the process and maintain the stability of the process and wafer productive yields. This article proposes using the random forests algorithm to analyze the importance of SVIDs of equipment sensors, automatically filters the key SVID by using {k}-means, and integrates various machine learning methods to verify the key SVIDs and identify key processing time and steps. Upon the key parameters are identified, the key processing time and steps are investigated subsequently. The ensemble models constructed on {k}-nearest neighbors ( {k} NNs) and naïve Bayes classifiers are presented for classifying wafers as normal or abnormal. Data visualization of multidimensional key SVIDs is performed by using {t}-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ( {t}-SNE) to create a graphical aid in FDC for the process engineer. An empirical study is conducted to validate the proposed data-driven framework for fault detection and diagnostic. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can detect abnormality effectively with highly imbalanced classes and also gain insightful information about the key SVIDs and corresponding key processing time and steps. Note to Practitioners-The challenges of equipment sensor data analytics in semiconductor manufacturing include building the classifier to detect wafer abnormality correctly, identification of key status variable identifications (SVIDs) and processing time and steps of abnormality, and data visualization of the abnormality in a high-dimensional feature space. This article proposes a data-driven framework for fault detection and classification (FDC) during the wafer fabrication process by incorporating several useful machine learning approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data-driven framework can supply quality fault detection performances and provide valuable information regarding the critical SVIDs and associated key processing time for fault diagnostic. The engineers can utilize the extracted fault patterns to perform a prognosis of the aging effect on process tools or modules for health management.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9066890/;7.9;9.3;10.4;;;9066890;;;

All rights reserved.Introduction: For the recently introduced single-pill combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin, real-world evidence has not been available. This observational study aims to assess real-world effectiveness of this combination, in the Indian outpatient setting of type-2 diabetes. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study design, involving patients from 4 centres across western India. Patients with type-2 diabetes and uncontrolled HbA1c, were categorized into 4 groups, including: (1) Naïve to DPP-4i or SGLT-2i; (2) Receiving DPP-4i; (3) Receiving SGLT-2i; (4) Receiving SGLT-2i and DPP-4i as individual pills. Patients were initiated on the fixed-dose combination of empagliflozin + linagliptin, and followed-up over 12-week duration. Clinical parameters of changes in glycaemia, body-weight, and blood-pressure were observed. Results: 251 patients were included in the analysis, with just over half of them being males (57%), or having pre-existing cardiovascular disease (54%). The group-wise patient distribution was approximately 47%, 18%,15%, and 20% respectively. The study represented patients across broad range of duration of type-2 diabetes, use of background antidiabetic therapies, and comorbid cardiovascular risk. The use of combination demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c, fasting and postprandial glycaemia levels across all the study groups. Reductions in body-weight and blood-pressure levels were also demonstrated. Interestingly, patients in group 4, who were switched from free drug combination to the fixed-dose combination, also demonstrated significant and meaningful improvements in HbA1c, fasting as well as postprandial glycaemia levels, suggestive of possible improvement in medication-adherence. Conclusion: This real-world evidence complements the results observed in randomized controlled trials, for meaningful effectiveness with the use of empagliflozin-linagliptin fixed dose combination in the Indian outpatient setting. More evidence may facilitate further characterization of clinical value of this promising combination.";None;0.7;0.6;0.7;;32978926;;;;

Here, we report the 96-week data for the study. Methods: This randomised, open-label, non-inferiority phase 3 trial, was done at two research sites in Johannesburg, South Africa, after participant recruitment from 11 public health clinics also in Johannesburg. Eligible participants were aged 12 years or older with HIV-1 infection, who weighed at least 40 kg, had no antiretroviral exposure in the previous 6 months, with a creatinine clearance of more than 60 mL/min (>80 mL per min in individuals aged <19 years), and a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of 500 copies per mL or higher. Individuals who were pregnant or had tuberculosis were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by study staff using a computerised randomisation system. Randomisation was stratified by age (12 and <19 years and 19 years). Participants were randomly assigned to once-daily oral fixed-dose combination tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg, and once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg; once-daily oral fixed-dose combination tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg, and once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg; or once-daily oral fixed-dose combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and efavirenz 600 mg. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants who had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of less than 50 copies per mL at week 48, which has been reported previously. Here, we report the key secondary efficacy endpoint of the proportion of participants who had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of less than 50 copies per mL at the week 96 visit, assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of any study drug, with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%. Safety data, including clinical, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and laboratory data, are also reported. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03122262. Findings: Between Jan 17, 2017, and May 14, 2018, we screened 1453 individuals, of whom 1053 were enrolled: 351 participants were randomly assigned to the tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, 351 to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, and 351 to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz group. All participants received at least one dose of study medication and were included in the primary analysis. At week 96, 276 (79%) of 351 participants in the tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, 275 (78%) of 351 participants in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, and 258 (74%) of 351 participants in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz group had achieved a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of less than 50 copies per mL. Non-inferiority was established in all three comparisons. The proportion of patients with protocol-defined virological failure at week 96 was low in all treatment groups. Participants in the tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group had fewer changes in bone density than the two other treatment groups. Mean weight gain was substantial (7·1 kg [SD 7·4] in the tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group; 4·3 kg [6·7] in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, and 2·3 kg [7·0] in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz group), and was greater among women than men. Ten (3%) of 351 participants in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz group discontinued due to treatment-related adverse events, of which liver dysfunction (n=4) and rash (n=4) were most common. Interpretation: Medium-term and long-term metabolic and clinical consequences of the considerable increase in bodyweight observed in participants given these antiretroviral regimens and the trajectory of this weight gain over time, especially among women, require further study.

Most available FDCs require twice-daily dosing to achieve optimum therapeutic effect. The objective of the PALLADIUM study was to assess the efficacy and safety of once-daily FDC of mometasone furoate plus indacaterol acetate (MF–IND) versus mometasone furoate (MF) monotherapy in patients with inadequately controlled asthma. Methods: This 52-week, double-blind, triple-dummy, parallel-group, phase 3 study recruited patients from 316 centres across 24 countries. Patients aged 12 to 75 years with a documented diagnosis of asthma for at least 1 year, percentage of predicted FEV1 of 50–85%, and an Asthma Control Questionnaire 7 score of at least 1·5 despite treatment with medium-dose or high-dose ICS or low-dose ICS plus LABA were included. A history of asthma exacerbations was not a study requirement. Participants were randomily assigned (1:1:1:1:1) via interactive response technology to receive one of the following treatments for 52 weeks: high-dose MF–IND (320 g, 150 g) or medium-dose MF–IND (160 g, 150 g) once daily via Breezhaler; high-dose MF (800 g [400 g twice daily]) or medium-dose MF (400 g once daily) via Twisthaler; or high-dose fluticasone propionate–salmeterol xinafoate (FLU–SAL; 500 g, 50 g) twice daily via Diskus. Participants received placebo via inhalation through the Breezhaler, Twisthaler, or Diskus devices in the mornings and evenings, as appropriate. The primary endpoint was improvement in trough FEV1 with high-dose and medium-dose MF–IND versus respective MF doses from baseline at 26 weeks, analysed in the full analysis set by means of a mixed model for repeated measures. High-dose MF–IND once daily was compared with high-dose FLU–SAL twice daily for non-inferiority on improving trough FEV1 at week 26 with a margin of 90 mL using mixed model for repeated measures as one of the secondary endpoints. Safety was assessed in all patients who had received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02554786, and is completed. Findings: Between Dec 29, 2015, and May 4, 2018, 2216 patients were randomly assigned (high-dose MF–IND, n=445; medium-dose MF–IND, n=439; high-dose MF, n=442; medium-dose MF, n=444; high-dose FLU–SAL, n=446), of which 1973 (89·0%) completed the study treatment and 234 (10·6%) prematurely discontinued study treatment. High-dose MF–IND (treatment difference [] 132 mL [95% CI 88 to 176]; p<0·001) and medium-dose MF–IND ( 211 mL [167 to 255]; p<0·001) showed superiority in improving trough FEV1 over corresponding MF doses from baseline at week 26. High-dose MF–IND was non-inferior to high-dose FLU–SAL in improving trough FEV1 from baseline at week 26 ( 36 mL [7 to 80]; p=0·101). Overall, the incidence of adverse events was similar across the treatment groups. Interpretation: Once-daily FDC of ICS and LABA (MFIND) significantly improved lung function over ICS monotherapy (MF) at week 26; high-dose MF–IND was non-inferior to twice-daily combination of ICS and LABA (high-dose FLU–SAL) for improvement in trough FEV1. The combination of MF–IND provides a novel once-daily dry powder option for asthma control.

All rights reserved.Aims & Objectives: The main aim of the present research work is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters as well as therapeutic efficacy of Hydrochlorothiazide along with Losartan used as a fixed dose combined drug in treatment of hypertension. Methods: This study is carried out by utilizing a typical two periods; randomized & two way complete cross over design. All the volunteers are received fixed dose and single dose product based on the randomization code in each clinical period. Then blood samples are taken and the comperative Pharmacokinetic study was carried out. Matrix effect for internal standard (Letrozole and Candesartan) and analytes (Losartan, LCA & HTCZ) were also carried out as per US-FDA guideline. Results and Discussion: Maximum plasma concentration of fixed dose combining drug (in which Losartan combined with HCTZ) was found 49±8.87 ng/ml (Cmax) at time 2.75±0.25hrs (tmax) for HCTZ and the average maximum plasma concentration of 6 volunteers was 49.87 ng/ml & Tmax 2.75hrs, AUC0-t was 227.02 ng/ml at 48 hrs and AUC0-227.67 ng/ml at infinite time & plasma half life (T1/2) of HCTZ 4.91hrs and Ket value is 0.14hr-1. The matrix effect of internal standard (letrozole) ranged between 87.32% to 89.71% and for HCTZ it was between 88.47%-89.86%. And the matrix effect of internal standard (Candesartan) ranged between 93.77%-98.28% & same was found between 95.97%-96.78% in case of Losartan and for LCA it was 95.41%-98.39%. Conclusion: From the comperative pharmacokinetic study it can be concluded that after fixed dose combined drug treatment the maximum plasma concentration of losartan and losartan carboxylic acid were too much higher than the maximum concentration of losartan and LCA after single drug containing losartan only. And fixed dose combination drug is more susceptible than single dose of Losartan for the treatment of hypertension with better therapeutic efficacy.";http://www.ijpronline.com/ViewArticleDetail.aspx?ID=16585;0.2;0.3;0.8;;;;;;

They operate over key process parameters on the basis of the metrological measurements acquired from the process and their deviations from the target setpoints. Conventionally, R2R controllers have been implemented independently of the actual equipment condition, which is obviously affecting the process stability and performance. Therefore, both equipment signals and process states shall be considered to make the R2R controllers more robust to the equipment condition drifts. In this paper, we propose a novel physics-informed framework to integrate the real-time equipment condition, based on the Fault Detection and Classification (FDC) data, into the R2R controllers. By utilizing Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN), the implicit relationship structure between metrology measurements, FDC indicators, and R2R regulators can be learned and reviewed explicitly. The structure shall be further reviewed to valid with the existing relationships and expert knowledge. Infeasible causalities on the structure will be constrained via setting up the blacklist at the structure learning stage. The proposed framework consists of the offline modeling stage, which incorporates the process, equipment variables, and the expert knowledge in the structure learning, and the online control stage, which constructs the Structured R2R controller (SRC) based on the relationship structure. As a result, the model is consistent by design with empirically known relationships and fundamental physical laws. The proposed SRC not only optimizes the operation with respect to the target control values but also considers the equipment and process states simultaneously. The effectiveness of SRC and the derivative control strategy are validated through a real dataset of a Chemical-Mechanical Polishing (CMP) process, and two simulated studies.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0957417420302487;9.5;10.2;11.0;S0957417420302487;;113424;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0957417420302487;;

The transmission lines continuously experience the number of shunt faults and its effect in the practical system rises the instability, line restoration cost and damages the load. Therefore, a robust and precise model is needed to detect and classify the faults for the rapid restoration of faulty phases. In this paper, we propose a SAT-CNN framework with time series imaging based feature extraction model for FDC of a transmission line. To ensure the noise immunity performance, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has been used to denoise the faulty voltage and current signals. The effectiveness of the proposed SAT-CNN framework is tested by varying the input signals namely voltage, current, and combined voltage and current signal, under the various sampling frequencies. The robustness of the proposed model is verified by adding the noises to the input data. Results show that the proposed model is capable to perform precise classification and detection of transmission line faults with high accuracy. A comparison between the proposed and other state-of-the-art FDC model is also studied to show the superiority of the proposed SAT-CNN model.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S037877962030242X;5.2;6.4;7.0;S037877962030242X;;106437;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S037877962030242X;;

As few as two sessions of combined MET and CBT has produced abstinence and reductions in cannabis use greater than delayed treatment controls. Despite their efficacy, outcomes in previous studies yielded abstinence rates from cannabis in the range of 20–30% at follow-ups of 6 to 12 months, and CUD remained a chronic condition for many. Additional models of providing treatment “as needed” (PRN), rather than as a single fixed-dose, are necessary to meet the different needs of adults with CUD and reengage those who do not respond to treatment initially or who relapse later. In the current study, 87 adults who met DSM-IV criteria for cannabis dependence were randomly assigned to receive either a fixed-dose of nine sessions of MET/CBT or to a PRN condition that provided a smaller initial dose of treatment, but allowed repeated access to treatment for 28 months. Cannabis use and associated problems were assessed every six months throughout a 34-month period. More than one-third of participants in the PRN condition accessed additional treatment episodes, but the total number of treatment sessions that participants utilized was comparable across conditions. Both treatments yielded significant reductions in cannabis use and associated problems at each follow-up. Contrary to hypotheses, the PRN condition did not yield better outcomes at the longer-term follow-ups. The fixed-dose condition produced greater rates of abstinence at the first follow-up, but otherwise there were no between group differences in outcomes. Future studies should test active approaches to reengaging participants with treatment when initial outcomes are less than optimal.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0740547220303445;4.8;4.7;5.0;S0740547220303445;32811637;108088;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0740547220303445;;

This strategy is based on coupling factors as numerical values or ratios as spectrum form with the recorded signals leading to induced mathematical filtration of the drug of interest and complete elimination of the interfering one in the combination without prior physical separation. The calculated factors were factor of equality in induced dual wavelength (IDW) or absorptivity factor in induced concentration subtraction method (ICS) while absorptivity ratio spectrum for induced amplitude modulation method (IAM). The calibration curves displayed linearity within 1.0–16.0 g/mL for ALO and 2.0–22.0 g/mL for PIO with good correlation coefficients. The induced methods specificity was also assured through the assaying different synthetic mixtures prepared to contain the two drugs in ratios approaching the ratio actually found in the marketed dosage form.

This study sought to identify ophthalmic medicines granted United Kingdom MA and consider trends in licence approvals. Methods: This retrospective study reviewed published lists of products granted MA by the UK Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency between January 2001 and December 2018, inclusive. Eye drops and medicinal products intended for ophthalmic use were identified. All regulatory data sources consulted are in the public domain. Data analyses were descriptive. Results: A total of 295 MAs were issued for ophthalmic products between 2001 and 2018, inclusive. Of these 229 (78%) were for single-active substances and 66 (22%) fixed-dose combination (FDC). Approvals for products with single-active substance included ocular hypotensives (115; 50%), antibiotics (48; 22%), allergy medicines (30; 13%), lubricants (18; 8%) and anti-inflammatories (11; 5%). Approvals for FDCs were predominantly ocular hypotensives (56; 85%), with timolol combined with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (27; 48%) and prostaglandin analogues (26; 46%) accounting for the majority of glaucoma FDCs. Other FDCs were approved for antibiotic/inflammatory (5; 7.5%), pupillary mydriasis (2; 3%), allergy (2; 3%) and ocular surface lubrication (1; 1.5%) products. A median of 16 licences were approved per year (range 7 [2005] to 35 [2011]). Conclusions: The majority of MAs granted were for single-agent products, particularly ocular hypotensives and antibiotic preparations. Most products were generic versions of well-established active substances. A trend for increased approvals for FDCs is evident, particularly for the treatment of raised IOP.";http://www.nature.com/articles/s41433-019-0758-7;3.7;3.6;4.3;;31900439;;;;

Direct central nervous system involvement by the virus usually manifests as HIV encephalitis, HIV leucoencephalopathy, vacuolar leucoencephalopathy or vacuolar myelopathy. Indirect involvement is usually associated with neurotropic opportunistic infections which include tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis and viral encephalitis such as herpes simplex, varicella-zoster, cytomegalovirus and Human polyomavirus 2. We report a case of transverse myelitis in a recently diagnosed HIV patient who was otherwise asymptomatic initially and developed paraparesis after 1 month of initiation of antiretroviral therapy. After ruling out opportunistic infections and other causes of compressive and non-compressive myelopathy, development of transverse myelitis was attributed to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in view of baseline low CD4 count and their improvement after HAART initiation. Prompt treatment with corticosteroids successfully reversed the symptoms.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13365-020-00879-4;5.0;4.6;4.7;;32671811;;;;

Its expression could be controlled during inflammatory process of gingiva; however, responsible mechanism for gingival overgrowth and involvement of FDC-SP in clinical condition is still unclear. We hypothesized that JE-specific genes are associated with the initiation of drug-induced gingival enlargement (DIGE) called gingival overgrowth, and investigated the changes of JE-specific gene’s expression and their localization in overgrown gingiva from the patients. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the FDC-SP localization was spread in overgrown gingival tissues. FDC-SP mRNA levels in GE1 and Ca9-22 cells were increased by time-dependent nifedipine treatments, similar to other JE-specific genes, such as Amelotin (Amtn) and Laminin3 subunit (Lam3), whereas type 4 collagen (Col4) mRNA levels were decreased. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that FDC-SP, AMTN, and Lam3 protein levels were increased in GE1 and Ca9-22 cells. Transient transfection analyses were performed using luciferase constructs including various lengths of human FDC-SP gene promoter, nifedipine increased luciferase activities of -345 and -948FDC-SP constructs.

HIV Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British HIV AssociationObjectives: Although outcomes of antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials, experiences from subpopulations defined by age, CD4 count or viral load (VL) in heterogeneous real-world settings are limited. Methods: The study design was an international multicohort collaboration. Logistic regression was used to compare virological and immunological outcomes at 12 ± 3 months after starting ART with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), contemporary nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or boosted protease inhibitor (PI/b) with two nucleos(t)ides after 1 January 2012. The composite treatment outcome (cTO) defined success as VL ' 200 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL with no regimen change and no AIDS/death events. Immunological success was defined as a CD4 count ' 750 cells/L or a 33% increase where the baseline CD4 count was  500 cells/L. Poisson regression compared clinical failures (AIDS/death  14 days after starting ART). Interactions between ART class and age, CD4 count, and VL were determined for each endpoint. Results: Of 5198 ART-naïve persons in the International Cohort Consortium of Infectious Diseases (RESPOND), 45.4% started INSTIs, 26.0% PI/b and 28.7% NNRTIs; 880 (17.4%) were aged ' 50 years, 2539 (49.4%) had CD4 counts ' 350 cells/L and 1891 (36.8%) had VL ' 100 000 copies/mL. Differences in virological and immunological success and clinical failure among ART classes were similar across age groups ( 40, 40–50 and ' 50 years), CD4 count categories ( 350 vs. ' 350 cells/L) and VL categories at ART initiation ( 100 000 vs. ' 100 000 copies/mL), with all investigated interactions being nonsignificant (P ' 0.05). Conclusions: Differences among ART classes in virological, immunological and clinical outcomes in ART-naïve participants were consistent irrespective of age, immune suppression or VL at ART initiation. While confounding by indication cannot be excluded, this provides reassuring evidence that such subpopulations will equally benefit from contemporary ART.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hiv.12888;5.6;5.3;5.8;;32588958;;;;

The majority (60%) of cases arise primarily in cervical, abdominal or axillar lymph nodes, but extra nodal origin from secondary lymphatic tissue like the tonsils, Waldeyer's ring or MALT is also common (40%). The current report presents a characteristic course of a cervical FDC-Sarcoma, with its challenges in establishing the initial diagnosis and the struggle for therapeutic options. The FDC-Sarcoma presented recurrently for four times. Three different university hospitals in Germany were involved in the patients' treatment. Due to the patients' refusal, no adju-vant therapy was applied. In the end, a neck dissection was performed. The patient was closely followed up and has been recurrence-free for 10 years. This case suggests operative resection in combination with a neck dissection as a curative therapy for FDC-Sarcoma of the head and neck.;http://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2020.2093;0;0;0.2;;;23;;;

All rights reserved.Background: Various studies have reported an association between vitamin D and CD4 levels. On the other hand, there are studies reporting the use of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs which will reduce vitamin D level. This study aimed to analyze the correlation of initial vitamin D level with changes of CD4 cells count after 3 months of ARV therapy in HIV naïve adult patients. Methods: This was a cohort study of HIV naïve patients who had never received ARV therapy. All study subjects were examined for 25(OH)D levels and CD4 cell count from serum blood before and after receiving ARV therapy for 3 months. Results: Among 24 subjects, 67% were male, with median age of 30 years, and 71% were at stage 1 HIV. There were no significant differences in levels of 25(OH)D after 3 months of ARV therapy (p = 0.275) with mean initial 25(OH)D levels of 20.48±3.18 ng/ml and after 3 months of ARV therapy of 19.78±4.47 ng/ml. A significant moderate correlation was found between initial 25(OH)D level and changes in CD4 cells count (r = 0.407, p = 0.048). Conclusions: Initial 25(OH)D level is associated with CD4 cells count changes after 3 months of ARV therapy in HIV naïve adult patients.;None;0.2;0.3;0.8;;;;;;

A total of 261 HIV-1-positive plasma samples, confirmed by the Suzhou CDC, were collected and evaluated to detect HIV-1 drug resistance genotypes using an in-house method. The pol gene fragment was amplified, and its nucleic acid sequence was determined by Sanger sequencing. Drug resistance mutations were then analyzed using the Stanford University HIV resistance database (https://hivdb.stanford.edu). A total of 216 pol gene fragments were amplified and sequenced with 16.7% (36/216) of sequences revealing these mutations. The drug resistance rates of protease, nucleoside reverse transcriptase, and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) were 4/36 (11.1%), 2/36 (5.6%), and 30/36 (83.3%), respectively. Five surveillance drug resistance mutations were found in 36 sequences, of which, three were found among specimens of men who have sex with men. Potential low-level resistance accounted for 33% of amino acid mutations associated with NNRTIs. Two of the mutations, M230L and L100I, which confer a high level of resistance efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP) used as NNRTIs for first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART), were detected in this study. Therefore, when HIV-1 patients in Suzhou are administered fist-line ART, much attention should be paid to the status of these mutations that cause resistance to EVP, EFV, and NVP.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11262-020-01774-0;3.0;3.1;3.4;;32500372;;;;

HIV Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British HIV AssociationObjectives: As per National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) estimates, there are 2.1 million people living with HIV (PWH) in India, of whom 1.2 million are on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study explored the use of a single-tablet regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg + lamivudine 300 mg + efavirenz 400 mg (TLE400 STR) as a first-line switch strategy in PWH in Pune, India. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in private sector ART clinics in three tertiary-level hospitals in Pune, India. PWH > 12 years of age (n = 502) who initiated first-line ART (predominantly TLE600 STR), completed  6 months of follow-up and achieved virological suppression [plasma viral load (VL) < 1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL] were identified and switched to TLE400 STR. The virological and immunological efficacy of TLE400 STR at 6 and 12 months of follow-up were noted. Grade 3/4 adverse events (especially efavirenz-related neuropsychiatric adverse events) leading to regimen discontinuation were also noted. Results: Of 502 PWH who switched to TLE400 STR, complete virological suppression (VL < 20 copies/mL) was maintained in more than 97% of patients at follow-up. TLE400 STR was successful in maintaining CD4 counts within the range observed at the start of the regimen. Grade 3/4 adverse events leading to TLE400 STR discontinuation were seen in 11 (2.2%) patients. Virological failure (VL > 1000 copies/mL) and treatment regimen failure were seen in six (1.2%) and 49 (9.8%) subjects, respectively. Conclusions: TLE400 STR exhibits excellent efficacy and safety as a switch strategy and should be introduced in the Indian National ART Program, especially for PWH who are virologically suppressed on TLE600 STR.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hiv.12912;5.6;5.3;5.8;;33021066;;;;

At 8 weeks, office SBP changes were –16.5 ± 15.5 mmHg (p < 0.001) with amlodipine/valsartan 5/80 mg FDC and –6.9 ± 11.4 mmHg (p = 0.012) with valsartan 160 mg monotherapy while corresponding changes in office DBP were –9.8 ± 7.7 mmHg (p < 0.001) and –2.5 ± 6.6 mmHg (p = 0.095), respectively. The between-group differences were –9.6 mmHg (95% CI, -18.1 to -1.1; p = 0.028) for SBP and –7.3 mmHg (95% CI, -11.8 to -2.8; p = 0.002) for DBP. Furthermore, reductions in both 24-hour SBP (–9.2 mmHg; 95% CI, -16.4 to -2.1; p = 0.013) and DBP (–4.6 mmHg; 95% CI, -9.2 to -0.1; p = 0.048) were consistently greater with amlodipine/valsartan 5/80 mg FDC than with valsartan 160 mg. Overall, 27 and 23 adverse events occurred in the amlodipine/valsartan 5/80 mg FDC group and in the valsartan 160 mg monotherapy group, respectively. The majority were mild and were not related to study medications. There were no significant differences in safety between two treatments. Conclusion: Efficacy of amlodipine/valsartan 5/80 mg FDC was superior to that of valsartan 160 mg monotherapy while both treatments were well-tolerated.";https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000386;2.5;2.8;2.9;;33009241;;;;

However, the clinical outcomes of fixed-dose combination (FDC) versus free-equivalent combination (FEC) of amlodipine and atorvastatin in the treatment of concurrent hypertension and dyslipidemia remain unknown. In this study, we included patients with newly diagnosed hypertension and dyslipidemia, without previously established cardiovascular disease, and treated with either FDC or FEC of amlodipine and atorvastatin were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan and follow-up for 5 years. By using 1:1 propensity score matching, a total of 1756 patients were enrolled in this study.

Although the all-cause mortality did not differ (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.59), the FEC group developed increased MI, stroke, and coronary revascularization (hazard ratio, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.07 to 7.68; hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.41 to 2.74; and hazard ratio, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.26 to 4.69, respectively). Furthermore, as an unexpected result, a higher risk to develop new-onset diabetes mellitus was observed with FEC regimens (hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.6 to 3.0).

High blood pressure (BP) is the leading global risk factor for all-cause preventable morbidity and mortality. Globally, only about 14% of patients achieve BP control to systolic BP <140 mm Hg and diastolic BP <90 mm Hg. Most patients (>60%) require two or more drugs to achieve BP control, yet poor adherence to therapy is a major barrier to achieving this control. Fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of BP-lowering drugs are one means to improve BP control through greater adherence and efficacy, with favorable safety and cost profiles. The authors present a review of the supporting data from a successful application to the World Health Organization (WHO) for the inclusion of FDCs of two BP-lowering drugs on the 21st WHO Essential Medicines List.

Treatment for TB includes isoniazid and rifampicin, with fixed-dose combination (FDC) recommended for improved patient compliance. Similarly, orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) are an increasingly popular dosage form that aid compliance since they do not require swallowing. In this study ODTs of isoniazid and rifampicin, either as discrete or FDC doses, were formulated and bioequivalence between single and combination doses compared using in vitro and in silico approaches. Dissolution profiles were compared using FDA advised difference (f1) and similarity (f2) testing in biorelevant media. Rifampicin release from FDCs decreased by approximately 15% in fed-state media (failed f1 and f2), which was attributed to enhanced rifampicin degradation in the presence of isoniazid at lower pH. Apparent permeability (Papp) values derived from Caco-2 transport studies were included alongside dissolution results into a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, to simulate in vivo bioavailability in healthy subjects. Models showed no difference in bioavailability between formulations or dosing (fasted or fed) state, despite the failures in dissolution-based bioequivalence testing, highlighting shortcomings in f1 and f2 assessment and the strength of PBPK models.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022354920303828;5.3;6.1;5.5;S0022354920303828;32710905;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0022354920303828;;

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 167 HIV-infected patients whose continuously highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) strategy was lamivudine +tenofovir+ efavirenz, of which 75 were HIV/HBV co-infected patients and 92 were HIV mono-infected patients. The biochemical examination results and demographic characteristics of all patients before HAART were collected, and routine blood test results (including platelet count) and immune cell count (including CD4 cells count) after all time points of HAART were obtained. All patients were observed until 72 months. CD4 cells count of 350 or 500 cells/l 72 months after HAART served as the boundary for judging the immune reconstruction effect. Results: The basic characteristics of HIV/HBV co-infected patients and HIV mono-infected patients were matched. All patients had a good viral response (HIV RNA <20 copies/ml, HBV DNA < 100 copies/mL) and immune response during HAART. The platelets with poor immune recovery in HIV/HBV co-infected patients were also maintained at an apparent lower level than that in patients with good immune recovery. However, this phenomenon was not found in HIV mono-infected patients. The platelet level at many time points after HAART therapy in HIV/HBV co-infected patients can predict the effect of immune recovery at 72 months after HAART. Conclusion: The platelet counts of HIV/HBV co-infected patients were correlated with CD4 counts during the follow-up of HAART. These results suggest that the mechanisms associated with thrombocytopenia may be involved in the regulation of immune recovery after treatment in HIV/HBV co-infected patients.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567134820303117;5.2;4.9;5.0;S1567134820303117;32736042;104480;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1567134820303117;;

Most previous studies were based on voxel-averaged, non-fibre-specific diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures, such as fractional anisotropy. In contrast, the novel diffusion MRI analysis framework, fixel-based analysis (FBA), enables whole-brain analysis of microstructural and macrostructural properties of individual fibre populations at a sub-voxel level. We applied FBA to investigate the long-term implications of VP birth and associated perinatal risk factors on fibre development in childhood and adolescence. Methods: Diffusion images were acquired for a cohort of VP (born <30 weeks’ gestation) and full-term (FT, 37 weeks’ gestation) children at two timepoints: mean (SD) 7.6 (0.2) years (n = 138 VP and 32 FT children) and 13.3 (0.4) years (n = 130 VP and 45 FT children). 103 VP and 21 FT children had images at both ages for longitudinal analysis. At every fixel (individual fibre population within an image voxel) across the white matter, we compared FBA metrics (fibre density (FD), cross-section (FC) and a combination of these properties (FDC)) between VP and FT groups cross-sectionally at each timepoint, and longitudinally between timepoints. We also examined associations between known perinatal risk factors and FBA metrics in the VP group. Results: Compared with FT children, VP children had lower FD, FC and FDC throughout the white matter, particularly in the corpus callosum, tapetum, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, fornix and cingulum at ages 7 and 13 years, as well as the corticospinal tract and anterior limb of the internal capsule at age 13 years. VP children also had slower FDC development in the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract between ages 7 and 13 years compared with FT children. Within VP children, earlier gestational age at birth, lower birth weight z-score, and neonatal brain abnormalities were associated with lower FD, FC and FDC throughout the white matter at both ages. Conclusions: VP birth and concomitant perinatal risk factors are associated with fibre tract-specific alterations to axonal development in childhood and adolescence.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811920305541;11.5;9.8;10.2;S1053811920305541;32585342;117068;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1053811920305541;;

A calibrated ionization cell in combination with precise simulation of the radiation environment in the reactor was used to accurately determine the dose received by the sensors. The agreement between sets of samples irradiated in different irradiation channels, hence dose rates, and different readout schemes was found to be very good. The dependence of the threshold voltage on the received dose was characterized over the entire range of doses.

Here, we explore dissolution, solubility, and supersaturation of various drug combinations in amorphous formulations. The effect of chemical structural similarity on combination behavior was investigated by using structurally related compounds of both drugs. The effect of polymer type on solution behavior was also evaluated using chemically diverse polymers. Indapamide (IPM) concentration decreased when combined with felodipine (FDN) or its analogues, which occurred even when the IPM solution was undersaturated. The extent of solubility decrease of FDN was less than that of IPM from the dissolution of an equimolar formulation of the drugs. No significant solubility decrease was observed for FDN at low contents of IPM which was also observed for other dihydropyridines, whereas FDN decreases at high contents of IPM. This was explained by the complex nature of the colloidal precipitates of the combinations which impacts the chemical potential of the drugs in solution at different levels. The maximum achievable concentration of FDN and IPM during dissolution of the polyvinylpyrrolidone-based amorphous solid dispersion was higher than the value measured with the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate-based formulation. This emphasizes the significance of molecular properties and chemical diversity of drugs and polymers on solution chemistry and solubility profiles. These findings may apply to drugs administered as a single dosage form or in separate dosage forms and hence need to be well controlled to assure effective treatments and patient safety.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.0c00835;8.2;7.4;7.5;;32870692;;;;

Some of the early research on TB treatment indicated drug resistance as one of the key challenges in fighting this disease. The discovery that administering two or more drugs simultaneously could lead to much more effective treatment, with reduced drug resistance and shorter periods of chemotherapy, was, therefore, a very significant breakthrough in TB drug research. Pursuant to this discovery, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended TB treatment employing fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) containing first line anti-TB drugs; rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, streptomycin and ethambutol. Regardless, certain challenges associated with FDCs remain and these include chemical instability and reduced bioavailability of rifampicin. Therefore, some research effort has been directed towards finding ways to deal with these challenges. One such effort involves the use of pharmaceutical co-crystals of the active pharmaceutical ingredients. Consequently, several pharmaceutical co-crystals of isoniazid and pyrazinamide have been reported. This paper aims at reviewing the multicomponent crystal structures of two first-line anti-TB drugs; isoniazid and pyrazinamide. The review will first set out a brief history of the disease, milestones in TB chemotherapy and the challenges associated with current treatment regimens. This will then be followed by a brief introduction to pharmaceutical co-crystals and how they can improve the physical and chemical properties of the active pharmaceutical ingredients. Secondly, multicomponent crystals of the two active pharmaceutical ingredients will be analysed by manual inspection for common supramolecular synthons between the drug molecules as well as between drug molecules and co-formers. Lastly; stability, solubility and dissolution experiments carried out on the pharmaceutical co-crystals of pyrazinamide and isoniazid will be analysed to gain insights into progress made with regards to improving stability and solubility of the active pharmaceutical ingredients.";http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=D0RA06478E;5.5;6.5;6.5;;;;;;

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1206 patients using efavirenz, tenofovir and lamivudine in multiple-tablet regimen who switched to the STR containing the same active ingredients in a southeast metropolis in Brazil. We measured adherence using the proportion of days covered (PDC95%) and evaluated this outcome before and after the switch using paired non-parametric statistics. Additionally, we used group-based trajectory modeling to identify adherence patterns to cART for each period and evaluate the migration behavior of patients between the trajectory groups. We observed a 14% increase in the proportion of adherent patients after switching to STR and a 6.2% increase in the proportion of patients with CD4 count'500 cells/l (p ' 0.001), without changes in viral load outcomes. We identified four adherence trajectories in each period. Most patients (60%, n = 722) migrated towards a group with better adherence trajectory or remained in the trajectory group with the highest probability of adherence after the switch. Our findings suggest that the implementation of the STR had a positive impact on adherence and CD4 count.

Methods: Single-centre, observational study in 82 adult outpatients with LBP due to disc herniation (4 Numerical Rating scale, NRS) who received either oral TRAM/DKP (n = 44) or intramuscular DIC/THIO (n = 38), both given every 12 h for 5 days. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in pain intensity (PI) at pre-specified post-dose time points (t day1, t day3, t day7) and compared between the two treatments. Additional endpoints, all evaluated at day 7, included: the sum of PI difference (SPID), percentage of responders in terms of PI reduction versus baseline and change from baseline in Douleur Neuropathique (DN4) score.

New inhalers have been developed to improve these determinants of treatment effectiveness. We assessed treatment adherence, satisfaction, and ease of use of DuoResp® Spiromax® among SPRINT study participants. Methods: The Phase IV SPRINT study was conducted in 10 European countries. Asthma and COPD patients were receiving a fixed-dose combination of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting 2-agonist (LABA), delivered via various inhalers including DuoResp Spiromax. DuoResp Spiromax users self-assessed adherence using the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8®), and ease of use and satisfaction using 10-point scales, during a single physician’s office visit. Results: Of 1661 (asthma: n = 1101; COPD: n = 560) SPRINT study participants, 342 (asthma: n = 235; COPD: n = 107) received DuoResp Spiromax prior to inclusion. Overall, 72.5% of DuoResp Spiromax users reported medium or high adherence (MMAS-8 score 6). Mean (standard deviation [SD]) satisfaction score for DuoResp Spiromax was 8.9 (1.6).

We aimed to report the non-inferior efficacy of dolutegravir compared with efavirenz 400 mg at week 96. Methods: We did a multicentre, randomised, open label, phase 3 trial in in three hospitals in Yaoundé, Cameroon, in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral-naive adults with an HIV RNA viral load of greater than 1000 copies per mL to compare dolutegravir 50 mg with efavirenz 400 mg (reference treatment), both combined with lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. The primary endpoint was the proportion with a viral load of less than 50 copies per mL at week 48 (10% non-inferiority margin). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02777229 and is ongoing. Findings: Between July, 2016, and August, 2019, of 820 patients assessed, 613 were randomly assigned to receive at least one dose of study medication, with 310 in the dolutegravir group and 303 in the efavirenz 400 mg group. At week 96 in the intention-to-treat analysis, 229 (74%) of 310 patients receiving dolutegravir and 219 (72%) of 303 patients receiving efavirenz, achieved plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL (difference 1·6%, 95% CI 5·4 to 8·6; p=0.66). Viral load suppression was reached significantly more rapidly in the dolutegravir group (p<0·001). Virological failure (>1000 copies per mL) was observed in 27 patients (eight in the dolutegravir group, among which, three women switched to efavirenz 600 mg because of the dolutegravir teratogeneicity signal, and 19 in the efavirenz 400 mg group). No acquired resistance mutations to dolutegravir were observed against 17 mutations to efavirenz with or without mutations to lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate among the 19 efavirenz 400 mg participants with virological failure. Weight gain was greater in the dolutegravir group (median weight gain, 5·0 kg in the dolutegravir group and 3·0 kg in the efavirenz 400 mg group, p<0·001, and incidence of obesity, 22% in the dolutegravir group and 16% in the efavirenz 400 mg group, p=0·043). The incidence of new WHO HIV-related stage 3 and 4 events was similar in each group (12 [4%] in each group). The two groups had similar rates of serious adverse events (28 [9%] of 310 in the dolutegravir group and 21 [7%] of 303 in the efavirenz 400 mg group). 18 deaths were observed during the 96-week follow-up (eight in the dolutegravir group and ten in the efavirenz 400 mg group). Interpretation: The non-inferior efficacy of the dolutegravir-based regimen and non-emergence of dolutegravir resistance at 96 weeks supports its use as a first-line regimen for antiretroviral-naive adults with HIV-1 infection. Viral load suppression was reached more quickly in the dolutegravir group and weight gain was significantly higher.

Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology (NFOG)Introduction: Emergency cesarean sections (EMCS) are associated with subsequent preterm birth, particularly at full dilation (FDCS), which is a cause of both second trimester miscarriages and early, recurrent spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB). The optimal management for these women in subsequent pregnancies is currently unknown. This study aims to assess efficacy of transvaginal cervical cerclage (TVC) in prevention of preterm birth among women who have had an EMCS followed by a subsequent late miscarriage or sPTB. Material and methods: A historical cohort study was performed assessing outcomes of women attending the Preterm Surveillance Clinic at St Thomas’ Hospital, London, who received TVC, with a history of EMCS (pregnancy A) followed by a sPTB/late miscarriage (pregnancy B) and a subsequent pregnancy (pregnancy C). A historical reference group managed in the same clinic was identified comprising women with any risk factor for sPTB, who required TVC. Incidence of delivery >24 to <30 weeks’ gestation was compared with relative risk and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup analysis was carried out assessing women who had a previous FDCS. Results: 209 women with a previous EMCS during labor (50 with FDCS), followed by sPTB/late miscarriage were identified. 178 progressed beyond 24 weeks; of these, 56 received TVC and formed the study group. 905 high-risk women were identified; of these, 154 received TVC and formed the reference group. Despite TVC treatment, 17/56 (30%) of the study group delivered <30 weeks’ gestation compared with 5/154 (3%) of the reference group (RR 9.4, 95% CI 3.6-24.2, P <.001). In the subset of 17 women in the study group with a previous FDCS, followed by sPTB/late miscarriage, 6/17 (35%) delivered <30 weeks’ gestation, significantly higher than the reference group (P <.001) but similar to EMCS at less than full dilation (35% vs 28%, P =.596). Overall, 33/72 (46%) women receiving cerclage with prior EMCS had either a mid-trimester loss or delivery <30 weeks. Conclusions: Transvaginal cervical cerclage appears less effective in preventing preterm birth among pregnant women who have had an EMCS followed by a sPTB/late miscarriage compared with other high-risk women. The lack of efficacy in the subgroup with an FDCS was similar.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aogs.13972;4.4;4.6;4.9;;32777082;;;;

With the ongoing efforts to improve indoor air quality (IAQ) through intervention of clean cooking options it is imperative to assess these interventions in real world conditions before large scale rollouts. The present study is an attempt to assess the impact of three clean cooking solutions - induction stove (IS), forced draft cookstove (FDC) and a traditional cookstove with hood (TCH) in rural area of Solan, Himachal Pradesh in India. Using a cross-sectional study design mean 24 h kitchen area concentration of PM2.5 and PM1, carbon monoxide (CO) along with cooking time black carbon (BC) were measured. A significant (p<0.05) reduction of >70% in mean 24 h and cooking time concentrations of all the pollutants was observed in all three clean cooking interventions compared to the traditional cookstove. However, in case of IS the reduction in mean 24 h PM2.5 and PM1 concentrations were 72% and 74% respectively which were much lower than nearly 100% reduction in CO and BC. Low cost interventions such as TCH were also found to improve IAQ significantly. However, higher BC fraction in PM in FDC indicated a scope for technological improvement in design of such stoves and a need for integrating BC as a stove performance indicator was also realized. Additionally, a comparative analysis using IAQ data from related studies highlighted the role of kitchen geometry and ambient air quality in causing variation in IAQ. So, for large scale community programs and initiatives that aim to mitigate HAP it is important to have multi-pronged approach that takes into cognizance factors other than cookstove which impact IAQ.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352186420313845;2.2;3.3;4.3;S2352186420313845;;101084;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2352186420313845;;

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at term equivalent age (TEA) can probe tissue microstructure and morphology, and demonstrates potential in the early prediction of outcomes. In this study, we use the recently introduced fixel-based analysis method for diffusion MRI to investigate the association between microstructure and morphology at TEA, and motor and cognitive development at 1 and 2 years corrected age (CA). Eighty infants born <31 weeks’ gestation successfully underwent diffusion MRI (3T; 64 directions; b = 2000s/mm2) at term equivalent age, and had neurodevelopmental follow-up using the Bayley-III motor and cognitive assessments at 1 year (n = 78) and/or 2 years (n = 76) CA. Diffusion MRI data were processed using constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) and aligned to a study-specific fibre orientation distribution template, yielding measures of fibre density (FD), fibre-bundle cross-section (FC), and fibre density and bundle cross-section (FDC). The association between FD, FC, and FDC at TEA, and motor and cognitive composite scores at 1 and 2 years CA, and change in composite scores from 1 to 2 years, was assessed using whole-brain fixel-based analysis. Additionally, the association between diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics (fractional anisotropy FA, mean diffusivity MD, axial diffusivity AD, radial diffusivity RD) and outcomes was investigated. Motor function at 1 and 2 years CA was associated with CSD-based measures of the bilateral corticospinal tracts and corpus callosum. Cognitive function was associated with CSD-based measures of the midbody (1-year outcomes only) and splenium of the corpus callosum, as well as the bilateral corticospinal tracts. The change in motor/cognitive outcomes from 1 to 2 years was associated with CSD-based measures of the splenium of the corpus callosum. Analysis of DTI-based measures showed overall less extensive associations. Post-hoc analysis showed that associations were weaker for 2-year outcomes than they were for 1-year outcomes. Infants with better neurodevelopmental outcomes demonstrated higher FD, FC, and FDC at TEA, indicating better information transfer capacity which may be related to increased number of neurons, increased myelination, thicker bundles, and/or combinations thereof. The fibre bundles identified here may serve as the basis for future studies investigating the predictive ability of these metrics.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811920306492;11.5;9.8;10.2;S1053811920306492;32663645;117163;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1053811920306492;;

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of combined treatment of losartan with ramipril on hypertension, myocardial infarction and vascular remodeling in disease animal models. Methods: In 8-telemetered spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs) orally treated with various doses of drugs or vehicle by cross-over protocol, systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were measured. The infarct size was measured in rats subjected to 30 min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) followed by 150 min reperfusion in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) rats injected drugs or vehicle once through femoral vein 15 min before inducing ischemia. The neointima formation and DNA synthesis in intima and media layer of the blood vessels were measured in cuff-induced vascular injury mice orally treated with drugs for 2 weeks. Results: As compared with single treatment, the combination therapy of both drugs significantly decreased SBP and MAP without significant reflex tachycardia. The combined treatment of both drugs significantly increased the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in coronary arterial tissues including area at occlusion. The combination therapy significantly decreased the thickness of vascular media layer and the number of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in both intima and media. Conclusion: The present data suggest that the combination therapy with fixed doses of losartan and ramipril may exert greater BP-lowering effects with protection against myocardial infarction and vascular remodeling.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40005-020-00478-9;2.5;3.9;6.5;;;;;;

To achieve that, prototype Al2O3:C and Al2O3:C,Mg OSL films produced by Landauer (Glenwood, IL, USA) were characterized using a MRIdian system (ViewRay Inc., Mountain View, California, USA). The system was initially equipped with three 60Co heads on a ring gantry combined with a 0.35 T split-magnet MRI system and later upgraded with a 6 MV Flattening Filter-Free (FFF) linear accelerator, with a fixed dose rate of 600 MU/min. The dosimetric properties of the film material (Al2O3:C) in the magnetic field were first tested by irradiating samples of 7 mm in diameter read using a Risø TL/OSL automated reader for high precision. OSL films (Al2O3:C and Al2O3:C,Mg) were then tested at different doses and for two different intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment plans, for which the gamma analysis was performed using the 2D dose information obtained by readout of the films using a laser-scanning OSL reader. The results using the “point-dosimeter” samples showed deviations <4% with the delivered dose and variations within the same package of <4% (standard deviation of the data). The gamma analysis for IMRT plans showed pass rates >95% with a 3% - 3 mm criteria (>84% with a 2% - 2 mm criteria), with the failure typically happening in the edges of the film, not in the central high dose region. The results did not show any clear influence of the magnetic field and demonstrate the feasibility of Al2O3:C and Al2O3:C,Mg OSL dosimeters for 2D dosimetry in MRgRT.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1350448720302171;2.4;2.6;2.9;S1350448720302171;;106439;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1350448720302171;;

Yet despite the many unique characteristics and promising advantages of EV beams, such as transverse momentum and quantized orbital angular momentum, there remains a limited understanding of their fundamental interactions with matter at the atomic scale. Collisions between EV projectiles and atomic targets can provide some insight into these interactions and we present here fully differential cross sections (FDCS) for ionization of excited state atomic hydrogen targets using EV projectiles. We show that the projectile's transverse momentum causes the ionized electron angular distributions to be altered compared to non-vortex projectiles and that the ionized electron's ejection angle can be controlled by adjustment of the vortex opening angle, a feature unique to vortex projectiles. Additionally, an inherent uncertainty in the projectile's momentum transfer leads to a broadening of the classical binary peak, making signatures of the target electron density more readily observable. FDCS for aligned 2p targets exhibit structures can be used to determine the alignment.;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6455/abb3ac;3.6;3.7;3.9;;;205205;;;

Objectives: To examine associations between pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and adverse birth outcomes, and if they differ by HIV status. Methods: We followed HIV-uninfected and -infected pregnant women initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) from first antenatal visit through delivery. HIV-infected women initiated ART (tenofovir-emtricitabine/lamivudine-efavirenz) in pregnancy. Estimated pre-pregnancy BMI (kg/m2) was categorised as underweight (<18.5), normal (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9), and obese (30.0). We used modified Poisson regression to estimate risk ratios (RR) for associations between pre-pregnancy BMI and adverse birth outcomes and explored modification by HIV status. Results: Among 1116 women (53% HIV-infected), 44% of HIV-uninfected women and 36% of HIV-infected women were classified as obese; 4% of women were underweight. Overall, 12% of infants were delivered preterm (<37 weeks), 10% small for gestational age (SGA, <10th percentile), and 9% large for gestational age (LGA, >90th percentile). Compared to HIV-uninfected women, HIV-infected women on ART had less LGA (5% vs 13%) but more SGA (12% vs 8%), and a similar proportion of preterm (13% vs 11%) infants. Pre-pregnancy BMI was not associated with preterm birth. Among HIV-uninfected women, obesity modestly increased the risk of LGA (RR 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82, 2.19), and underweight modestly elevated the risk of SGA (RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.79, 3.46). These associations were attenuated among HIV-infected women (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.44, 2.64 for LGA, and RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.49, 3.64 for SGA). Conclusions: In this urban African setting of high HIV prevalence, pre-pregnancy obesity was common and did not vary by HIV status. In HIV-uninfected women, obesity increased the risk of LGA and being underweight the risk of SGA, compared with among HIV-uninfected women.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ppe.12688;4.6;4.5;5.1;;32490582;;;;

The nucleoside analogue 2’-fluoro-2’-deoxycytidine (2’-FdC) has been reported to have broad antiviral activity. Here, we report that 2’-FdC significantly inhibits murine norovirus replication in macrophages. This effect was partially reversed by exogenous supplementation of cytidine triphosphate. The combination of 2’-FdC with mycophenolic acid, ribavirin or favipiravir (T705) exerts synergistic antiviral effects.

It is classified as conventional and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-positive inflammatory FDC sarcoma according to the 2019 World Health Organization classification of digestive system tumours; the latter is rarer. So in view of the rarity and difficulty in diagnosis, the aim of the manuscript is to share our experience of diagnosing EBV-positive inflammatory FDC sarcoma. Methods and results: Here, we describe the clinicopathological features, gross description, histomorphology, immunophenotype, EBV-encoded mRNA (EBER) in-situ hybridisation, gene rearrangement and clinical follow-up of two patients with EBV-positive inflammatory FDC sarcoma in the colon, and review the relevant literature. The tumours were found in two males, aged 53 and 48 years, respectively, with a tumour diameter between 10 and 45 mm. Both cases occurred in the colon and presented as pedunculated colonic masses. Microscopically, scanty atypical ovoid to spindle neoplastic cells were mixed in a background of florid lymphoplasmacytic infiltration. The nuclei of these atypical cells showed vesicular chromatin and small, distinct nucleoli. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the atypical stromal cells were positive for CD21, CD23, CD35, and D2-40. EBER in-situ hybridisation also gave positive results in two cases. There was a mean follow-up of 9 months (range, 7–11 months). Conclusion: EBV-positive inflammatory FDC sarcoma is an extremely rare tumour with a distinct morphology and phenotype. Therefore, it is very important to recognise it particularly for correct diagnosis and prevention of misdiagnosis and mistreatment.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/his.14169;6.0;5.8;6.3;;32506505;;;;

It has been proposed that the first step in anaerobic microbial degradation of recalcitrant aromatic compounds is a UbiD-mediated carboxylation. In this study, we use the UbiD enzyme ferulic acid decarboxylase (Fdc) in combination with a carboxylic acid reductase to create aromatic degradation-inspired cascade reactions, leading to efficient functionalization of styrene through CO2 fixation. We reveal that rational structure-guided laboratory evolution can expand the substrate scope of Fdc, resulting in activity on a range of mono- and bicyclic aromatic compounds through a single mutation. Selected variants demonstrated 150-fold improvement in the conversion of coumarillic acid to benzofuran + CO2 and unlocked reactivity towards naphthoic acid. Our data demonstrate that UbiD-mediated C–H activation is a versatile tool for the transformation of aryl/alkene compounds and CO2 into commodity chemicals.

Clopidogrel + ASA in a fixed-dose combination (FDC) provides a pharmaceutical option to enhance adherence to the coadministration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Herein, we evaluate the bioequivalence of enteric ASA and clopidogrel in an FDC compared with simultaneous administration of the individual formulations. Methods: This study is a randomized, single-center, open-label, three-sequence, three-period, two-treatment, crossover study conducted in healthy Chinese male and female subjects under fed conditions. Subjects were randomized to receive, in each period, a single dose of (1) a combination tablet containing 75-mg clopidogrel and 100-mg enteric ASA (test formulation) or (2) coadministration of one 75-mg clopidogrel tablet and one 100-mg enteric-coated ASA tablet (reference formulations) under fed conditions. Plasma samples were analyzed for ASA, salicylic acid, clopidogrel, and the clopidogrel metabolite SR26334. For ASA, the reference-scaled average bioequivalence (RSABE) analysis was conducted for Cmax of ASA because within-subject standard deviation (SDW) was  0.294 for log-transformed Cmax. Results: The point estimate (test/reference geometric mean ratio) was between 0.80 and 1.25, and the upper one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the scaled average bioequivalence metric was  0 (-0.08). AUC of ASA as SDW was < 0.294 for log-transformed AUClast and AUC. Estimates of 90% CIs for log-transformed AUClast and AUC ratios were within the bioequivalence range of 0.80 to 1.25 (0.98–1.08 and 1.00–1.10, respectively). For clopidogrel, the 90% CIs for the ratios comparing log-transformed Cmax, AUClast, and AUC ratios of clopidogrel following administration of test versus reference formulation were calculated using the ABE method and were well within the acceptable range of 0.80 to 1.25 (1.02–1.12, 0.92–0.99, and 0.92–0.98, respectively). Conclusion: FDC of ASA and clopidogrel was bioequivalent to the simultaneous administration of the individual formulations in healthy Chinese subjects under fed conditions.

However, real-world data on the effectiveness of gliclazide in India is unavailable. Objective: To provide real-world evidence regarding the effectiveness of gliclazide or gliclazide + metformin fixed-dose combination or separate medications, used either as monotherapy or as the latest add-on to other antihyperglycemic agents in reducing glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in Indian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: Electronic medical record data of adult patients who were diagnosed with T2DM who were newly initiated on or had been prescribed gliclazide or gliclazide + metformin combination for < 30 days as monotherapy or as add-on therapy to other antihyperglycemic agents, and had HbA1c  6.5% were retrospectively analyzed. Mean change in HbA1c from baseline was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were assessment of dosages and formulations of gliclazide or gliclazide + metformin prescribed in the HbA1c spectrum and antihyperglycemic agents to which gliclazide or gliclazide + metformin was added as an adjunct. Readings were obtained before initiating gliclazide or gliclazide + metformin and after at least 90 days of treatment with gliclazide or gliclazide + metformin. Results: Included patients (n = 498) were categorized into gliclazide only (n = 66), gliclazide + metformin only (n = 179), gliclazide add-on (n = 169), and gliclazide + metformin add-on (n = 84) groups. Mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) change in HbA1c among patients with baseline HbA1c > 7% was  0.8% ( 1.26,  0.34) in gliclazide only group;  1.6% ( 1.89,  1.31; p < 0.001) in gliclazide + metformin group;  1.2% ( 1.50,  0.90; p < 0.001) in add-on gliclazide group; and  1.4% ( 1.75,  1.05; p < 0.001) in add-on gliclazide + metformin group. Gliclazide once daily was the most prescribed regimen in the gliclazide only group (72.7%), with 60 mg being the most prescribed modified-release dose (62.5%). Gliclazide + metformin twice daily was the most prescribed regimen in the gliclazide + metformin group (69.3%) with 80 mg + 500 mg being the most prescribed immediate-release dose (62.9%). Gliclazide and gliclazide + metformin were most added as an adjunct to existing prescriptions of biguanides (83.4%) or insulin (64.3%), respectively. Conclusion: Gliclazide or gliclazide + metformin prescribed as mono- or add-on therapy during routine clinical practice effectively reduced HbA1c in Indian patients with T2DM, thus validating the use of gliclazide and gliclazide + metformin for managing T2DM in India.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40801-020-00206-7;0;2.3;3.3;;;;;;

Topical delivery of antibacterial combinations to the lung could dramatically enhance antibacterial activities and provide a means to overcome bacterial resistance development. The aim of the study was to investigate the potential of new inhalable dry powder combinations consisting of a fixed dose of aztreonam (Azt) and tobramycin (Tob) using a spray drying process, against antibiotic resistant Gram-negative respiratory pathogens. The interactions of Azt with Tob on resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii were determined by calculating factional inhibitory concentration indices (FICI). A fixed concentration ratio of Azt and Tob that exhibited a synergistic antimicrobial effect was selected and formulated into inhalable dry powders by co-spray drying with and without L-leucine. The obtained dry powders were characterized with respect to the morphology, particle size distribution, solid state, moisture sorption behaviour, and in vitro dissolution. Storage stability, aerosol performance, and in vitro antibacterial activity were also evaluated. Inhalable dry powders consisting of Azt, Tob and L-leucine could be readily obtained via the spray drying process with a fine particle fraction of above 40% as determined using a next generation impactor. The co-spray drying process resulted in amorphous Azt/Tob dry powders with or without the addition of L-leucine as indicated by X-ray powder diffraction. The dissolution rates of the co-spray dried Azt/Tob dry powders were decreased, and the storage stability was improved with an increase in the proportion of L-leucine in the formulations. The inclusion of L-leucine did not affect the minimum inhibitory concentration and the co-spray dried powders reserved the synergistic antibacterial effects and exhibited enhanced antibacterial activities as compared to the individual antibiotic used alone on multidrug-resistant (Azt and Tob resistant) P. aeruginosa 25756 and A. baumannii K31. This study demonstrates that inhalable Azt/Tob dry powders using L-leucine as a moisture protector as well as a dispersing agent can be readily prepared by the spray drying process. This new inhalable fixed dose combinational dry powders may represent an alternative treatment against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative respiratory pathogens.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378517320308620;6.6;7.2;7.6;S0378517320308620;32927003;119877;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0378517320308620;;

International Journal of Clinical Practice Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdIntroduction: Combination therapy with an alpha blocker (AB) plus an antimuscarinic (AM) is recommended for men with moderate-to-severe mixed lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) when monotherapy is not effective in relieving storage symptoms. This study compared treatment persistence and adherence with an AB plus AM fixed-dose combination (FDC) vs an AB plus AM free-dose combination in men with LUTS in Spain. Methods: Retrospective study using the Spanish IQVIA Cegedim Electronic Medical Records database. Men prescribed AB plus AM combination therapy were included in an FDC or free-dose combination cohort based on their index treatment. Treatment persistence was the time from index date to first discontinuation of 1 of the two index drugs over 12 months. Adherence was measured using the fixed medication possession ratio (MPR). Results: Of 3114 patients identified, 999 were included (FDC, n = 790; free-dose combination, n = 209). Median (95% CI) persistence was longer in the FDC (125 [109-151] days) than in the free-dose combination (31 [31-36] days) cohort (hazard ratio [HR], 2.9; 95% CI, 2.4-3.4; P <.0001). The 12-month persistence rates were 31.1% (FDC cohort) and 8.9% (free-dose cohort). The mean (SD) fixed MPR was higher in the FDC cohort (48.8 [37.2]) compared with the free-dose cohort (23.1 [28.4]); more patients in the FDC cohort (34.2%) than in the free-dose cohort (10.0%) were adherent (MPR  80%). The probability of treatment persistence and adherence increased with age (>80 vs <65 years, persistence HR, 0.7 [95% CI, 0.5-0.9]; MPR difference, 12.5), polypharmacy (persistence HR, 0.7 [95% CI, 0.6-0.9]; MPR difference, 10.7) and previous use of AB (persistence HR, 0.8 [95% CI, 0.7-1.0]; MPR difference, 5.7) or AB/AM combinations (persistence HR, 0.7 [95% CI, 0.5-0.9]; MPR difference, 11.1). Conclusions: Treatment with an AB/AM FDC is associated with better persistence and adherence vs a free-dose combination in men with LUTS in Spain.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijcp.13616;4.6;4.4;4.3;;32681522;e13616;;;

In this study, we assess the influence of TLR7 and TLR8 gene polymorphisms on HIV-1 susceptibility, AIDS development, and treatment outcomes. The TLR7 and TLR8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped through real-time PCR in 222 patients living with HIV-1 and 141 healthy controls. Frequencies of the TLR7-IVS2-151 G/A and TLR7-IVS1 + 1817 G/T genotypes and alleles were not significantly increased in patients with HIV-1 infection compared to healthy controls both in males and females. Whereas, males carrying TLR8 Met allele were twice susceptible to HIV-1 infection compared to subjects with A allele (OR = 2.04, 95 % CI 1.103.76; p = 0.021). Interestingly, for TLR8-129 G/C, both males and females carrying G allele and GG genotype, respectively were significantly associated with HIV-1 infection (p < 0.0001). Moreover, the TLR7 IVS1 + 1817 G/T and the TLR8 rs3764880 were associated with protection to progress the AIDS stage in male and female, respectively (p < 0.05). Males carrying TLR7 IVS2-151-A allele showed a significant increased level of HIV-1 viral load pre-treatment, in comparison with individuals carrying the G allele (p-value = 0.036). Additionally, males carrying TLR8 Met allele showed statistically higher HIV viral load at baseline (p-value = 0.04) and after treatment (p-value = 0.013). Regarding CD4 + T cell counts, no significant association was found with TLR7 and TLR8 SNPs before and after antiretroviral treatment. This data demonstrates that TLR8 polymorphisms could affect HIV-1 infection. Moreover, an association between TLR7 IVS2-151-A and TLR8 Met alleles and plasma HIV viral load level was found.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165247820303783;5.0;4.5;5.1;S0165247820303783;32888973;;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0165247820303783;;

The specific release of both types of granules was shown in vitro through their dissolution profiles, which indicated that potassium citrate was released within the first 2–3 h and potassium bicarbonate up to 10–12 h after administration. The long-lasting coverage of ADV7103 was confirmed through a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-period study, measuring its effect on urine pH in healthy adults (n = 16) at doses of alkalising agent ranging between 0.98 and 2.88 meq/kg/day. A significant increase of urine pH with a positive dose–response in healthy adult subjects was shown. Urine pH above 7 was maintained during 24 h with a dosing equivalent to 1.44 meq/kg twice a day, while urine pH was below 6 most of the time with placebo. The effect observed was non-saturating within the range of doses evaluated and the formulation presented a good safety profile.

We aimed to measure alterations in microbial translocation, monocyte activation, gut immune recovery, and intestinal epithelial cell damage in HAART treated individuals. Methods: A prospective, single-arm, longitudinal, cohort study was conducted among antiretroviral naïve HIV-1 infected Thai participants. All participants were in chronic stage of HIV-1 infection before starting HAART. Data and samples were collected prior to initiation of HAART and then after 24 and 48 weeks of HAART. Plasma biomarkers for microbial translocation (16S rDNA and LBP), monocyte activation (sCD14) and intestinal epithelial cell damage (I-FABP) were evaluated. We measured circulating gut-homing CD4+ T cells and circulating gut-homing Th17 cells to assess recoveries of gut immunity and gut immunity to microbial pathogens. Results: The kinetic studies showed no reduction in the levels of plasma 16S rDNA, sCD14 or I-FABP, significant decrease of plasma LBP level, and slow but significant increases in the frequencies of circulating gut-homing CD4+ T cells and circulating gut-homing Th17 cells during 48 weeks of HAART. Dividing participants into low and high microbial translocation (low and high MT) groups at baseline, both groups showed persistent plasma levels of 16S rDNA, sCD14 and I-FABP, and significantly decreased plasma level of LBP. The low MT group had significantly increased frequencies of circulating gut-homing CD4+ T cells and circulating gut-homing Th17 cells during 48 weeks of HAART but this was not observed in the high MT group. Conclusions: We demonstrated persistent high microbial translocation, monocyte activation and intestinal epithelial cell damage with slow gut immune recovery during successful short-term HAART. Additionally, gut immune recovery was apparently limited by high microbial translocation. Our findings emphasize the adverse impact of high microbial translocation on gut immune recovery and the necessity of establishing a novel therapeutic intervention to inhibit microbial translocation.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1043466620302738;5.8;6.1;5.0;S1043466620302738;32861144;155257;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1043466620302738;;

We develop a mathematical framework to illustrate the connection between copulas and prior FDC-based approaches. The performance of copula methods is compared to several other streamflow estimation methods using a decade of daily streamflow data from 74 sites located within two river basins in the southeast United States with different climate characteristics and physiographic properties. We show that copula approaches: (1) outperform other methods in the limiting case of perfect information with regard to the rank-based correlation structure and FDCs across the gaging network; (2) provide a hedge against poor performance when donor information becomes sparser and less informative; (3) outperform other methods when used for partially gaged sites with several years of available data; and (4) remain a competitive albeit nondominating method for ungaged sites and partially gaged sites with limited data when realistic error is introduced in the estimation of FDCs and correlations across the gaging network.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019WR025138;7.2;7.4;6.8;;;;;;

The silicon carbide (SiC)/epoxy resin composites with nonlinear conductivities have great potential applications in high temperature superconducting equipment. In this article, SiC/epoxy resin composites with different filler loading are fabricated, and the nonlinear conductivities are measured at cryogenic temperature. The results indicate that when the filler loading is higher than 17.32 vol%, the composites present field-dependent nonlinear conductivity (FDC) properties. The nonlinear conductivity shows an increasing trend with filler loading increasing or temperature rising. Besides, the temperature-dependent nonlinear conductivity (TDC) is proposed, the mechanism of which can be attributed to the following. With the decrease of temperature, the amplitude of carrier thermal vibration decreases, which make the carriers harder to cross the Schottky barrier in the SiC-epoxy interface and the Poole-Frenkel barrier in epoxy matrix. On the other hand, the carrier-freeze-out effect significantly weakens the impurity ionization in SiC fillers at lower temperature, leading to a decrease of ionized carriers in SiC. The studies herein make a recommendation that the SiC/epoxy composites with a filler content of 29.52 vol% have a larger field-dependent nonlinear coefficient and lower temperature dependence, and play a more effective role in reducing the nonuniformities of electric field distribution in the current leads of HTS dc cable.;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9133316/;2.7;2.9;3.3;;;9133316;;;

FDCS can thus occur in lymph nodes as well as non-lymphoid organs. Intraabdominal FDCS is even rarer. Our aim was to describe the clinical and morphological features of intra-abdominal FDCSs diagnosed in our practice and to review published literature on FDCSs including intra-abdominal FDCSs. Methods: All cases of FDCSs diagnosed between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2019 were included in the study. Slides of the cases were reviewed and clinical follow up was obtained. Results: A total of 18 cases of intraabdominal FDCS were diagnosed during the study period. Age range was 17 to 55 years. Mean and median ages were 28 and 29 years respectively. Of the 18 patients, 11 were male and 7 were females. Colon was involved in 9 cases and appendix in 2 cases. 9 cases were received as resection specimens while 9 cases were received as slides and blocks for second opinion. Tumor size ranged from 2.7 to 26 cm. Average tumor size in these 9 cases was 8.2 cm and in 6 of these 9 cases, tumor size was greater than 6 cm in largest dimension. Grossly, tumors were nodular or polypoid and had a fleshy, grey white, homogeneous cut surface. Histologically, all 18 cases showed proliferation of plump to spindle shaped cells arranged in a fascicular or storiform pattern. Tumor cells had mild to moderately pleomorphic spindle to ovoid vesicular nuclei with fine chromatin and inconspicuous to variably conspicuous nucleoli, and moderate amount of pale eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic activity was usually brisk. CD21 and CD23 were positive in all 18 cases. Resection margins were negative in all 9 resection specimens. Lymph nodes positive for metastases were seen in 4 cases. Follow up was available in 13 cases. Recurrence was seen in 6 patients, out of which 3 patients died of disease 15, 17- and 24-months following resection. 1 patient with appendiceal FDCS was free of disease almost 12 years after surgery but recently developed recurrence and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. 6 patients were alive and well at the time of follow-up 5 to 68 months after resection. None of them had developed recurrence or metastases at the time of follow up. 8 of the 13 patients received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy post-surgical resection. Conclusion: Colon was involved in 9 of our 18 cases. Lymph nodes were positive for metastases in 4 out of 9 resection specimens. All cases were diagnosed based on morphology supported by positivity for immunohistochemical stains CD21 and CD23. Histological factors associated with aggressive behavior were seen in 14 cases. Majority of patients had an aggressive clinical course.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1092913420301386;2.8;2.8;2.5;S1092913420301386;;151595;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1092913420301386;;

In Peru, genotypic resistance testing is not routinely performed before ART initiation, and estimated PDR prevalence prior to 2012 ranged from 1.0% to 4.7%. We aimed to update estimates of PDR prevalence in men who have sex with men (cis-MSM) and transgender women (TW). Methods: We obtained HIV sequences from three studies of ART-naïve cisgender-MSM and TW (n = 470) in Lima, Peru from 2013 to 2017, almost two-thirds of whom had acute or recent infections. Sanger sequences of HIV pol were interrogated for surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRM) using the Stanford Calibrated Population Resistance (CPR) tool and scored for resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) with the HIVdb programme. We calculated binomial proportions and 95% confidence intervals. 2 and exact or trend tests were used to examine predictors of PDR. Results: Seventy-seven (16.4%) individuals had PDR (95% CI: 13.2 to 20.0); most resistance was likely TDR since 63% were incident infections. SDRM were present in 9.8% (7.3 to 12.9). Resistance to any NRTI was present in <1% of individuals, while efavirenz resistance was present in 10% (6.9% to 12.4%). TW were not statistically more likely than cis-MSM to have PDR (11.4% vs. 9.1%, p = 0.54). Age, incident versus prevalent infection, or residence district did not predict PDR. Prevalence of SDRM increased from 3% in 2013 to 21% 2017 within incident infections (p = 0.04), but not when including prevalent infections. Conclusions: Prevalence of NNRTI resistance in three studies of ART-naïve MSM and TW in Lima, Peru reaches 10%. Because our study reports PDR in a population in which most acquired HIV recently, the overall prevalence of PDR, including previously treated persons, is likely underestimated. These results underscore the need for a nationally representative survey of PDR in Peru and consideration of non-NNRTI anchored first-line ART options. This study also represents the first evaluation of PDR in cis-MSM versus TW in South America, and demonstrates that, although TW are at higher risk of acquiring HIV, they are at similar risk of acquiring a virus with resistance mutations.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jia2.25411;5.5;6.7;7.1;;31773888;e25411;;;

Furthermore, we aimed to explore the potential of FBA measures as biomarkers of glaucomatous ON degeneration. Methods: DWI scans were obtained from 15 glaucoma patients and 15 controls. ONs were tracked and segmented into their three anatomical segments; intraorbital (IO), intracanalicular (ICAN) and intracranial (ICRAN). For each segment, FBA measures were computed, which included fiber density (FD; a measure of axonal density), fiber-bundle cross-section (FC; an estimate of morphological changes), and fiber density and cross-section (FDC). Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness and visual field mean deviation (VFMD) were assessed for glaucoma patients. ANCOVA was used to compare FBA values between the two groups, and Spearman's correlation analysis was used to test the correlation between FBA measures and pRNFL thickness and VFMD. Results: All glaucomatous ON segments showed a significant loss of FD and FDC compared to the controls, while a loss of FC was found in the IO and ICRAN segments only. FD and FDC values of the IO and ICAN segments of glaucomatous ONs showed significant correlations with pRNFL thickness and VFMD. Conclusions: Glaucomatous ONs exhibit lower FD and FC compared to controls, indicating axonal loss and gross atrophy. The correlation between FBA measures of glaucomatous ONs and established clinical tests of glaucoma demonstrates the potential of FBA measures as biomarkers of glaucomatous ON degeneration.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0720048X20305453;4.8;4.8;4.8;S0720048X20305453;;109356;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0720048X20305453;;

This therapy is commonly done by using fixed doses, potentially resulting in supraphysiologic levels of triiodothyronine (T3). A good understanding of the LT3 pharmacokinetics (PK) is necessary to design combination treatment schemes that are able to maintain serum T3 levels within the reference range, but data on the PK of LT3 are conflicting. Here, we present a study designed to characterize the PK of LT3 in patients devoid of endogenous thyroid hormone production, and not receiving LT4 therapy. Methods: We performed an open-label, PK study in patients undergoing thyroid hormone withdrawal in preparation for nuclear medicine procedures for the evaluation and treatment of follicular-derived TC. LT3 was substituted for LT4 at a 1:3 mcg/mcg dosage ratio thrice daily for at least 30 days. PK of the last LT3 dose while at steady state and terminal elimination was assessed over 11 days. Thereafter, a PK study was performed following the nuclear medicine procedure in patients who volunteered for a second study. Results: Fourteen patients age 48.5 ± 16.0 years completed the last dose study and five completed the second PK study. PK analysis indicates a time to maximum serum concentration of 1.8 ± 0.32 hours and two distinct phases of linear elimination, with a fast distribution phase and slow elimination phases with half-lives of 2.3 ± 0.11 hours and 22.9 ± 7.7 hours, supporting a two-compartment model. PK modeling predicts that a twice-daily administration of low-dose LT3 (0.07 mcg/kg twice daily) in combination with LT4 can predictably increase the serum T3 concentration without significant peaks above the reference range. Conclusions: The PK of LT3 is well described by a two-compartment model that assumes elimination only from the sampling compartment, with a rapid distribution phase and a slow elimination phase. This information will contribute to design therapeutic strategies for LT3/LT4 combination therapies directed to maintain stable T3 serum levels.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/thy.2019.0101;10.5;12.2;13.2;;31364488;;;;
