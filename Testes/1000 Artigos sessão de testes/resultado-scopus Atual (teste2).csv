Here we show an approach to eradicate HIV infections by selective elimination of host cells harboring replication-competent HIV (SECH), which includes viral reactivation, induction of cell death, inhibition of autophagy and the blocking of new infections. Viral reactivation triggers cell death specifically in HIV-1-infected T cells, which is promoted by agents that induce apoptosis and inhibit autophagy. SECH treatments can clear HIV-1 in >50% mice reconstituted with a human immune system, as demonstrated by the lack of viral rebound after withdrawal of treatments, and by adoptive transfer of treated lymphocytes into uninfected humanized mice. Moreover, SECH clears HIV-1 in blood samples from HIV-1-infected patients. Our results suggest a strategy to eradicate HIV infections by selectively eliminating host cells capable of producing HIV.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17753-w;18.5;18.1;18.1;;;;;

In these derivatives, four TGGGAGT tracts have been joined together by exploiting 3-3 and 5-5 inversion of polarity sites formed by canonical phosphodiester bonds or a glycerol-based linker. Circular dichroism data suggest that all oligodeoxynucleotides fold in monomolecular G-quadruplex structures characterized by a parallel strand orientation and three side loops connecting 3- or 5-ends. The derivative bearing two lipophilic groups, namely HT353LGly, inhibited virus entry into the host cell, with anti-HIV-1 activity in the low nanomolar range; the other derivatives, albeit sharing the same base sequence and similar topology, were inactive. These results highlight that monomolecular Hotoda's aptamers with inversion of polarity sites represent a successful alternative strategy that merges the easiness of synthesis with the maintenance of remarkable activity. They also indicate that two lipophilic groups are necessary and sufficient for biological activity.

Another Artemisia species, Artemisia campestris subsp. glutinosa (Besser) Batt., field wormwood, has been traditionally used as medicinal plant in the Mediterranean region. Aim of the study: The aim of this study is to investigate the anti–HIV activity of field wormwood, to identify the compounds responsible for this activity and their structure and mechanism of action. Materials and methods: Antiviral activity of isolated compounds and extracts was evaluated in HIV–1 infections of lymphoblastoid cells. We also evaluated the mechanism of action of isolated compounds. Viral entry was studied comparing the inhibitory effect of isolated compounds on wild type HIV–1 and VSV pseudotyped HIV–1. To assess the viral transcriptional effect, plasmids encoding luciferase reporter genes under the control of the whole genome of HIV–1 or NF–B or Sp1 transcription factors were transfected in the presence of the compounds under evaluation. Finally, antioxidant activity was assessed by quantitation of reduced and total glutathione in treated cell cultures. Results: Ethanolic and aqueous extracts of Artemisia campestris subsp. glutinosa (Besser) Batt. subsp. glutinosa displayed anti–HIV activity in vitro, although ethanolic extract was more powerful (IC50 14.62 g/mL). Bio–guided ethanolic extract fractionation leads to the isolation and characterization of two terpenes, damsin and canrenone, and four flavonoids, 6, 2, 4–trimethoxyflavone, acerosin, cardamonin and xanthomicrol. All the isolated compounds inhibited HIV–1 replication in vitro with IC50 values between the middle nanomolar and the low micromolar range. Their anti–HIV mechanism of action is due to the bloking of viral entry and/or transcription inhibition, without correlation with the antioxidant activity, through interference with the cellular transcription factors NF–B and Sp1, which are targets that are not currently reached by antiretroviral therapy. Conclusion: We describe here the anti–HIV activity of field wormwood, Artemisia campestris subsp. glutinosa (Besser) Batt., and the isolation and study of the mechanism of action of two terpenes and four flavonoids, responsible, at least in part, for its activity, through the inhibition of two different cellular targets affecting the HIV replication cycle. The activity of these compounds in cellular targets could explain why plant extracts can be used in the treatment of different diseases. Besides, the presence of several compounds with dual and different mechanisms of action could prove useful in the treatment of HIV–1 infection, since it could aid to overcome drug resistances and simplify drug therapy. This work is a further step in understanding the anti–infectious activity of wormwood species and their use in treating infectious diseases.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378874120330452;6.3;6.5;6.3;03788741;S0378874120330452;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0378874120330452;;

In recent years, different methodologies developed to visualize genome topology and spatial relationships between genes have gained much attention as instruments to decode the relationship between chromatin structure and function. In addition to chromosome conformation capture–based techniques, highly multiplexed forms of FISH combined with high-throughput and super-resolution microscopy are used to map and spatially define contact frequencies between different genomic regions. All these approaches have strongly contributed to our knowledge of how the human genome is packed in the cell nucleus. In this chapter, we describe detailed step-by-step protocols for 3D immuno-DNA FISH detection of genes and Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) provirus in primary CD4+ T cells from healthy donors, or cells infected in vitro with the virus. Our multicolor 3D-FISH technique allows, by using up to three fluorophores, visualization of spatial positioning of loci inside a 3D cell nucleus.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-0716-0664-3_14;1.7;1.6;1.8;10643745;;;;

To further promote their use, we attempted to enhance vector infectivity by targeting the dimerization and packaging properties of the RNA transfer vector based on the premise that these two processes are tightly linked. We rationally designed mutant vectors to favor the dimeric conformation, potentially enhancing genome packaging. Initial assessments using standard assays generated outputs of variable reproducibility, sometimes with conflicting results. Therefore, we developed a novel competitive qRT-PCR assay in a co-transfection setting to measure the relative packaging efficiencies of wild-type and mutant transfer vectors. Here we report the effect of the dimerization-stabilizing mutations on infectious and physical titers of lentiviral vectors together with their packaging efficiency, measured using our novel assay. Enhancing dimerization did not automatically lead to better vector RNA packaging, suggesting that, for vector functionality, sufficient flexibility of the RNA to adopt different conformations is more important than the dimerization capacity. Our novel competitive qPCR assay enables a more stringent analysis of RNA packaging efficiency, allowing a much more precise understanding of the links between RNA structure, packaging, and infectious titers that will be invaluable for future vector development. To optimize lentiviral vectors by enhancing genome packaging, Vamva et al. developed a competitive qRT-PCR assay to enable quantification of lentiviral RNA packaging with unprecedented accuracy. This assay has wide application in the gene therapy field for validation and quantitative titration of vectors for use in investigative and therapeutic studies.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2329050120301959;4.5;5.0;6.2;;S2329050120301959;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2329050120301959;;

However, KLH is a multi-subunit particle derived from a natural source, and its manufacture as a clinical product remains a challenge. Here we report the preclinical development of recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment (rTTHC) linked to FP8 (FP8-rTTHC) as a suitable FP-conjugate vaccine immunogen. We assessed 16 conjugates, made by coupling the 4 most prevalent FP8 sequences with 4 carrier proteins: the aforementioned KLH and rTTHC; the H. influenzae protein D (HiD); and the cross-reactive material from diphtheria toxin (CRM197). While each of the 16 FP8-carrier conjugates could elicit HIV-1-neutralizing responses, rTTHC conjugates induced higher FP-directed responses overall. A Sulfo-SIAB linker yielded superior results over an SM(PEG)2 linker but combinations of carriers, conjugation ratio of peptide to carrier, or choice of adjuvant (Adjuplex or Alum) did not significantly impact elicited FP-directed neutralizing responses in mice.

Based on cross-sectional data collected from June 2008 to May 2013, we assessed changes in HIV prevalence, risk factors for HIV, provision of PMTCT antiretroviral treatment (ART), and the association between HIV infection, birth outcomes and maternal characteristics at the Simão Mendes National Hospital, Guinea-Bissau’s largest maternity ward. Among 24,107 women, the HIV prevalence was 3.3% for HIV-1, 0.8% for HIV-2 and 0.9% for HIV-1/2. A significant decline in HIV-1, HIV-2, and HIV-1/2 prevalence was observed over time. HIV infection was associated with age and ethnicity. A total of 85% of HIV-infected women received ART as part of PMTCT, yet overall treatment coverage during labour and delivery declined significantly for both mothers and infants. Twenty-two percent of infants did not receive treatment, and 67% of HIV-2-infected mothers and 77% of their infants received ineffective non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors for PMTCT.

The conformational dynamics of the flap region of the protease is critical for the ligand binding mechanism, as well as for the catalytic activity. The monoclonal antibody F11.2.32 raised against HIV-1 protease inhibits its activity on binding. We have studied the conformational dynamics of protease in its free, inhibitor ritonavir and antibody bound forms using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that upon Ab binding to the epitope region (residues 36–46) of protease, the overall flexibility of the protease is decreased including the flap region and the active site, which is similar to the decrease in flexibility observed by inhibitor binding to the protease. This suggests an allosteric mechanism to inhibit protease activity. Further, the protease mutants G40E and G40R are known to have decreased activity and were also subjected to MD simulations. We find that the loss of flexibility in the mutants is similar to that observed in the protease bound to the Ab/inhibitor. These insights highlight the role played by dynamics in the function of the protease and how control of flexibility through Ab binding and site specific mutations can inhibit protease activity.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62423-y;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

However, our understanding of how different vaccine types elicit durable antibody responses is lacking. To assess the impact of vaccine type on antibody responses, we measured IgG isotypes against four consensus HIV antigens from 2 weeks to 10 years post HIV-1 vaccination and used mixed effects models to estimate half-life of responses in four human clinical trials. Compared to protein-boosted regimens, half-lives of gp120-specific antibodies were longer but peak magnitudes were lower in Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-boosted regimens. Furthermore, gp120-specific B cell transcriptomics from MVA-boosted and protein-boosted vaccines revealed a distinct signature at a peak (2 weeks after last vaccination) including CD19, CD40, and FCRL2-5 activation along with increased B cell receptor signaling. Additional analysis revealed contributions of RIG-I-like receptor pathway and genes such as SMAD5 and IL-32 to antibody durability. Thus, this study provides novel insights into vaccine induced antibody durability and B-cell receptor signaling.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69007-w;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

However, the source of the proliferation of HIV-infected cells remains unclear. Here, we analyze the TCR repertoire of single HIV-infected cells harboring translation-competent proviruses in longitudinal samples from eight individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART). When compared to uninfected cells, the TCR repertoire of reservoir cells is heavily biased: expanded clonotypes are present in all individuals, account for the majority of reservoir cells and are often maintained over time on ART. Infected T cell clones are detected at low frequencies in the long-lived central memory compartment and overrepresented in the most differentiated memory subsets. Our results indicate that clonal expansions highly contribute to the persistence of the HIV reservoir and suggest that reservoir cells displaying a differentiated phenotype are the progeny of infected central memory cells undergoing antigen-driven clonal expansion during ART.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17898-8;18.5;18.1;18.1;;;;;

However, the origin and nature of the rebound virus has remained unclear. Recent studies have suggested that rebound virus does not originate directly from individual latent proviruses but rather from recombination events involving multiple proviruses. Here we evaluate the origin of rebound virus in 16 ART-suppressed, chronically SIV-infected rhesus monkeys following ART discontinuation. We sequence viral RNA and viral DNA in these animals prior to ART initiation, during ART suppression, and following viral rebound, and we compare rebound viral RNA after ART discontinuation with near full-length viral DNA from peripheral blood and lymph node mononuclear cells (PBMC and LNMC) during ART suppression. Sequences of initial rebound viruses closely match viral DNA sequences in PBMC and LNMC during ART suppression. Recombinant viruses are rare in the initial rebound virus populations but arise quickly within 2–4 weeks after viral rebound. These data suggest that intact proviral DNA in PBMC and LNMC during ART suppression is likely the direct origin of viral rebound in chronically SIV-infected rhesus monkeys following ART discontinuation.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19254-2;18.5;18.1;18.1;;;;;

Several GWAS studies have reported that genetic heterogeneity of individuals leads to differential HIV susceptibility. Proxy SNPs that are in Linkage Disequilibrium to the GWAS SNPs could be important targets in HIV pathogenesis and need to be analyzed further for their potential regulatory role. Current study thus aimed to identify novel proxy SNPs that may play a critical role in HIV susceptibility and disease progression. 372 SNPs, associated with HIV-1/AIDS pathogenesis, were retrieved via GWAS catalogue. 1854 proxy SNPs, in Linkage Disequilibrium (r2 = 0.8) to the GWAS reported SNPs, were identified using the SNAP web tool. Regulatory functions of aforementioned 1854 polymorphic sites (GWAS SNPs and their proxy SNPs) were acquired from RegulomeDB. 178 of the proxy SNPs showed evidence of strong regulatory potential returning a score of 3. Among these regulatory SNPs, 22 had already been reported for their association with HIV/AIDS while 156 SNPs showed novel association. Three of these novel SNPs (g.rs6457282T>C, g.rs17064977C>T and g.rs3130350G>T) were validated using sequence specific PCR (SSP-PCR) on HIV-infected patients.

Males and females differ in their patterns of Meth use, associated behaviors, and responses, but the underlying mechanisms and impact of HIV infection are unclear. Transgenic mice with inducible HIV-1 Tat protein in the brain (iTat) replicate many neurological aspects of HIV infection in humans. We previously showed that Tat induction enhances the Meth sensitization response associated with perturbation of the dopaminergic system, in male iTat mice. Here, we used the iTat mouse model to investigate sex differences in individual and interactive effects of Tat and Meth challenge on locomotor sensitization, brain expression of dopamine receptors (DRDs) and regulatory adenosine receptors (ADORAs). Because Meth administration increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we also determined whether the effects of Meth could be rescued by concomitant treatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). After Meth sensitization and a 7-day abstinence period, groups of Tat+ and Tat-male and female mice were challenged with Meth in combination with NAC. We confirmed that Tat expression and Meth challenge suppressed DRD mRNA and protein in males and females’ brains, and showed that females were particularly susceptible to the effects of Meth on D1-like and D2-like DRD subtypes and ADORAs. The expression of these markers differed strikingly between males and females, and between females in different phases of the estrous cycle, in a Tat -dependent manner. NAC attenuated Meth-induced locomotor sensitization and preserved DRD expression in all groups except for Tat + females. These data identify complex interactions between sex, Meth use, and HIV infection on addiction responses, with potential implications for the treatment of male and female Meth users in the context of HIV, especially those with cognitive disorders.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0028390820303130;9.3;7.6;8.3;00283908;S0028390820303130;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0028390820303130;;

However, attempts to elicit similar oligomannose-specific bnAbs by immunizing with oligomannosidic glycoconjugates have only been modestly successful so far. A common assumption is that eliciting oligomannose-specific bnAbs is hindered by B cell tolerance, resulting from the presented oligomannosides being sensed as self molecules. Here, we present data, along with existing scientific evidence, supporting an additional, or perhaps alternate, explanation: serum mannosidase trimming of the presented oligomannosides in vivo. Mannosidase trimming lessens the likelihood of eliciting antibodies with capacity to bind full-sized oligomannose, which typifies the binding mode of existing bnAbs to the oligomannose patch. The rapidity of the observed trimming suggests the need for immunization strategies and/or synthetic glycosides that readily avoid or resist mannosidase trimming upon immunization and can overcome possible tolerance restrictions.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64500-8;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

Therefore, it is urgent to find new HIV inhibitors and targets. Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3 family members (APOBEC3) are important host restriction factors that inhibit HIV-1 replication by their cytidine deaminase activity. HIV-1 viral infectivity factor (Vif) promotes proteasomal degradation of APOBEC3 proteins by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in which core-binding factor  (CBF) is a necessary molecular chaperone. Interrupting the interaction between Vif and CBF can release APOBEC3 proteins to inhibit HIV-1 replication and may be useful for developing new drug targets for HIV-1. In this study, we identified a potent small molecule inhibitor CBF/Vif-3 (CV-3) of HIV-1 replication by employing structure-based virtual screening using the crystal structure of Vif and CBF (PDB: 4N9F) and validated CV-3's antiviral activity. We found that CV-3 specifically inhibited HIV-1 replication (IC50 = 8.16 µm; 50% cytotoxic concentration >100 µm) in nonpermissive lymphocytes. Furthermore, CV-3 treatment rescued APOBEC3 family members (human APOBEC3G (hA3G), hA3C, and hA3F) in the presence of Vif and enabled hA3G packaging into HIV-1 virions, which resulted in Gly-to-Ala hypermutations in viral genomes. Finally, we used FRET to demonstrate that CV-3 inhibited the interaction between Vif and CBF by simultaneously forming hydrogen bonds with residues Gln-67, Ile-102, and Arg-131 of CBF. These findings demonstrate that CV-3 can effectively inhibit HIV-1 by blocking the interaction between Vif and CBF and that this interaction can serve as a new target for developing HIV-1 inhibitors.";http://www.jbc.org/lookup/doi/10.1074/jbc.RA120.013404;8.2;7.7;7.4;;;;;

All Rights Reserved.Synonymous genome recoding has been widely used to study different aspects of virus biology. Codon usage affects the temporal regulation of viral gene expression. In this study, we performed synonymous codon mutagenesis to investigate whether codon usage affected HIV-1 Env protein expression and virus viability. We replaced the codons AGG, GAG, CCU, ACU, CUC, and GGG of the HIV-1 env gene with the synonymous codons CGU, GAA, CCG, ACG, UUA, and GGA, respectively. We found that recoding the Env protein gp120 coding region (excluding the Rev response element [RRE]) did not significantly affect virus replication capacity, even though we introduced 15 new CpG dinucleotides. In contrast, changing a single codon (AGG to CGU) located in the gp41 coding region (HXB2 env position 2125 to 2127), which was included in the intronic splicing silencer (ISS), completely abolished virus replication and Env expression. Computational analyses of this mutant revealed a severe disruption in the ISS RNA secondary structure. A variant that restored ISS secondary RNA structure also reestablished Env production and virus viability. Interestingly, this codon variant prevented both virus replication and Env translation in a eukaryotic expression system. These findings suggested that disrupting mRNA splicing was not the only means of inhibiting translation. Our findings indicated that synonymous gp120 recoding was not always deleterious to HIV-1 replication. Importantly¸ we found that disrupting an external ISS loop strongly affected HIV-1 replication and Env translation. IMPORTANCE Synonymous substitutions can influence virus phenotype, replication capacity, and virulence. In this study, we explored how synonymous codon mutations impacted HIV-1 Env protein expression and virus replication capacity. We changed a single codon, AGG to CGU, which was located in the gp41 coding region (env nucleotide residues 2125 to 2127) and was included in the HIV-1 intronic splicing silencer. This change completely abolished virus replication and Env expression. We also found that changing codon usage in the gp120 region by including an increased number of CpG dinucleotides did not significantly affect Env expression or virus viability. Our findings showed that synonymous recoding was useful for altering viral phenotype and exploring virus biology.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/21/e01108-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

There are no algorithms currently that can directly determine genotype and quasispecies population using short HTS reads generated from long genome sequences without additional software. To establish a robust subpopulation, subtype, and recombination analysis workflow, we amplified the HIV-1 3'-half genome from plasma samples of 65 HIV-1-infected individuals and sequenced the entire amplicon (4,500 bp) by HTS. With direct analysis of raw reads using HIVE-hexahedron, we showed that 48% of samples harbored 2 to 13 subpopulations. We identified various subtypes (17 A1s, 4 Bs, 27 Cs, 6 CRF02_AGs, and 11 unique recombinant forms) and defined recombinant breakpoints of 10 recombinants. These results were validated with viral genome sequences generated by single genome sequencing (SGS) or the analysis of consensus sequence of the HTS reads. The HIVE-hexahedron workflow is more sensitive and accurate than just evaluating the consensus sequence and also more cost-effective than SGS.IMPORTANCE The highly recombinogenic nature of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) leads to recombination and emergence of quasispecies. It is important to reliably identify subpopulations to understand the complexity of a viral population for drug resistance surveillance and vaccine development. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) provides improved resolution over Sanger sequencing for the analysis of heterogeneous viral subpopulations. However, current methods of analysis of HTS reads are unable to fully address accurate population reconstruction. Hence, there is a dire need for a more sensitive, accurate, user-friendly, and cost-effective method to analyze viral quasispecies. For this purpose, we have improved the HIVE-hexahedron algorithm that we previously developed with in silico short sequences to analyze raw HTS short reads. The significance of this study is that our standalone algorithm enables a streamlined analysis of quasispecies, subtype, and recombination patterns from long HIV-1 genome regions without the need of additional sequence analysis tools. Distinct viral populations and recombination patterns identified by HIVE-hexahedron are further validated by comparison with sequences obtained by single genome sequencing (SGS).;https://msphere.asm.org/content/5/5/e00551-20;2.4;4.0;5.9;;;;;

However, there is scarce data about the evolutionary history of HHV-8 particularly in multiethnic Latin American populations. Objectives: The aims of this study were to characterize the genetic diversity and the phylogeography of HHV-8 in two distant geographic regions of Argentina, and to establish potential associations with pathogenic conditions and the genetic ancestry of the population. Study design: A total of 101 HIV-1 infected subjects, 93 Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) patients and 411 blood donors were recruited in the metropolitan (MET) and north-western regions of Argentina (NWA). HHV-8 DNA was detected by ORF-26 PCR in whole blood, saliva and FFPE tissues. Then, ORF-26 and ORF-K1 were analyzed for subtype assignment. Mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome haplogroups, as well as autosomal ancestry markers were evaluated in samples in which subtypes could be assigned. Phylogeographic analysis was performed in the ORF-K1 sequences from this study combined with 388 GenBank sequences. Results: HHV-8 was detected in 50.7%, 59.2% and 8% of samples from HIV-1 infected subjects, KS patients and blood donors, respectively. ORF-K1 phylogenetic analyses showed that subtypes A (A1-A5), B1, C (C1-C3) and F were present in 46.9%, 6.25%, 43.75% and 3.1% of cases, respectively. Analyses of ORF-26 fragment revealed that 81.95% of strains were subtypes A/C followed by J, B2, R, and K. The prevalence of subtype J was more commonly observed among KS patients when compared to the other groups. Among KS patients, subtype A/C was more commonly detected in MET whereas subtype J was the most frequent in NWA. Subtypes A/C was significantly associated with Native American maternal haplogroups (p = 0.004), whereas subtype J was related to non-Native American haplogroups (p < 0.0001). Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and Latin America were the most probable locations from where HHV-8 was introduced to Argentina. Conclusions: These results give evidence of the geographic circulation of HHV-8 in Argentina, suggest the association of ORF-26 subtype J with KS development and provide new insights about its relationship with ancient and modern human migrations and identify the possible origins of this virus in Argentina.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567134820303543;5.2;4.9;5.0;15671348;S1567134820303543;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1567134820303543;;

All rights reserved.The viral protein Gag selects full-length HIV-1 RNA from a large pool of mRNAs as virion genome during virus assembly. Currently, the precise mechanism that mediates the genome selection is not understood. Previous studies have identified several sites in the 5= untranslated region (5= UTR) of HIV-1 RNA that are bound by nucleocapsid (NC) protein, which is derived from Gag during virus maturation. However, whether these NC binding sites direct HIV-1 RNA genome packaging has not been fully investigated. In this report, we examined the roles of single-stranded exposed guanosines at NC binding sites in RNA genome packaging using stable cell lines expressing competing wild-type and mutant HIV-1 RNAs. Mutant RNA packaging efficiencies were determined by comparing their prevalences in cytoplasmic RNA and in virion RNA. We observed that multiple NC binding sites affected RNA packaging; of the sites tested, those located within stem-loop 1 of the 5= UTR had the most significant effects. These sites were previously reported as the primary NC binding sites by using a chemical probe reverse-footprinting assay and as the major Gag binding sites by using an in vitro assay. Of the mutants tested in this report, substituting 3 to 4 guanosines resulted in <2-fold defects in packaging. However, when mutations at different NC binding sites were combined, severe defects were observed. Furthermore, combining the mutations resulted in synergistic defects in RNA packaging, suggesting redundancy in Gag-RNA interactions and a requirement for multiple Gag binding on viral RNA during HIV-1 genome encapsidation. IMPORTANCE HIV-1 must package its RNA genome during virus assembly to generate infectious viruses. To better understand how HIV-1 packages its RNA genome, we examined the roles of RNA elements identified as binding sites for NC, a Gag-derived RNA-binding protein. Our results demonstrate that binding sites within stem-loop 1 of the 5= untranslated region play important roles in genome packaging. Although mutating one or two NC-binding sites caused only mild defects in packaging, mutating multiple sites resulted in severe defects in genome encapsidation, indicating that unpaired guanosines act synergistically to promote packaging. Our results suggest that Gag-RNA interactions occur at multiple RNA sites during genome packaging; furthermore, there are functionally redundant binding sites in viral RNA.";https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/21/e00439-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

We characterized geographic proximity by transmission risk and urban-rural characteristics among people with closely related HIV strains suggestive of potential transmission relationships. METHODS: We analyzed US National HIV Surveillance System data of people diagnosed between 2010 and 2016 with a reported HIV-1 partial polymerase nucleotide sequence. We used HIV TRAnsmission Cluster Engine (HIV-TRACE) to identify sequences linked at a genetic distance of 0.5%. For each linked person, we assessed median distances between counties of residence at diagnosis by transmission category and urban-rural classification, weighting observations to account for persons with multiple linked sequences. RESULTS: There were 24,743 persons with viral sequence linkages to at least one other person included in this analysis. Overall, half (50.9%) of persons with linked viral sequences resided in different counties, and the median distance from persons with linked viruses was 11 km/7 miles [interquartile range (IQR), 0-145 km/90 miles]. Median distances were highest for men who have sex with men (MSM: 14 km/9 miles; IQR, 0-179 km/111 miles) and MSM who inject drugs, and median distances increased with increasing rurality (large central metro: 0 km/miles; IQR, 0-83 km/52 miles; nonmetro: 103 km/64 miles; IQR, 40 km/25 miles-316 km/196 miles).

The TLR7 and TLR8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped through real-time PCR in 222 patients living with HIV-1 and 141 healthy controls. Frequencies of the TLR7-IVS2-151 G/A and TLR7-IVS1 + 1817 G/T genotypes and alleles were not significantly increased in patients with HIV-1 infection compared to healthy controls both in males and females.

Wepresent a reselection strategy to evaluate the impact of several modifications on preexisting aptamer pools. RNA aptamer libraries with affinity to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) were retranscribed with 2'-F, 2'-OMe, or 2'-NH2 pyrimidines and subjected to three additional selection cycles. RT inhibition was observed for representative aptamers from several structural families identified by high-throughput sequencing when transcribed with their corresponding modifications. Thus, reselection identified specialized subsets of aptamers that tolerated chemical modifications fromunmodified preenriched libraries. Inhibition was the strongest with the 2'-F-pyrimidine (2'-FY) RNAs, as compared to inhibition by the 2'-OMeY and 2'-NH2Y RNAs. Unexpectedly, a diverse panel of retroviral RTs were strongly inhibited by all 2'-FY-modified transcripts, including sequences that do not inhibit those RTs as unmodified RNA. The magnitude of promiscuous RT inhibition was proportional to mole fraction 2'-FY in the transcript. RT binding affinity by 2'-FY transcripts was more sensitive to salt concentration than binding by unmodified transcripts, indicating that interaction with retroviral RTs is more ionic in character for 2'-FY RNA than for unmodified 2'-OH RNA. These surprising features of 2'-FY-modified RNA may have general implications for applied aptamer technologies.;http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/lookup/doi/10.1261/rna.077008.120;7.6;6.9;7.1;13558382;;;;

Resistance profiles are not well defined among individuals on failing second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). METHODS: Resistance genotypes were performed during screening for enrollment into a trial of third-line ART (AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 5288). Prior exposure to both nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-NRTIs and confirmed virologic failure on a protease inhibitor-containing regimen were required. Associations of drug resistance with sex, age, treatment history, plasma HIV RNA, nadir CD4+T-cell count, HIV subtype, and country were investigated. RESULTS: Plasma HIV genotypes were analyzed for 653 screened candidates; most had resistance (508 of 653; 78%) to 1 or more drugs. Genotypes from 133 (20%) showed resistance to at least 1 drug in a drug class, from 206 (32%) showed resistance to at least 1 drug in 2 drug classes, and from 169 (26%) showed resistance to at least 1 drug in all 3 commonly available drug classes. Susceptibility to at least 1 second-line regimen was preserved in 59%, as were susceptibility to etravirine (78%) and darunavir/ritonavir (97%). Susceptibility to a second-line regimen was significantly higher among women, younger individuals, those with higher nadir CD4+ T-cell counts, and those who had received lopinavir/ritonavir, but was lower among prior nevirapine recipients. CONCLUSIONS: Highly divergent HIV drug resistance profiles were observed among candidates screened for third-line ART in LMIC, ranging from no resistance to resistance to 3 drug classes. These findings underscore the need for access to resistance testing and newer antiretrovirals for the optimal management of third-line ART in LMIC.";https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/7/e170/5625392;14.0;13.8;12.5;;;;;

The GagPol viral polyprotein precursor associates with mitochondrial lysyl-tRNA synthetase (mLysRS) in a complex with tRNALys, an essential step to initiate reverse transcription in the virions. The C-terminal integrase moiety of GagPol is essential for its association with mLysRS. We show that integrases from HIV-1 and HIV-2 bind mLysRS with the same efficiency. In this work, we have undertaken to probe the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of the complex of integrase with mLysRS. We first established that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of integrase is the major interacting domain with mLysRS. Using the pBpa-photo crosslinking approach, inter-protein cross-links were observed involving amino acid residues located at the surface of the catalytic domain of mLysRS and of the CTD of integrase. In parallel, using molecular docking simulation, a single structural model of complex was found to outscore other alternative conformations. Consistent with crosslinking experiments, this structural model was further probed experimentally. Five compensatory mutations in the two partners were successfully designed which supports the validity of the model. The complex highlights that binding of integrase could stabilize the tRNALys:mLysRS interaction.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/10/1202;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

Since 2007, five INSTIs have been introduced: raltegravir, elvitegravir, dolutegravir, bictegravir, and cabotegravir. The INSTIs have favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, which contribute to both their effectiveness and their ease of use. With the exception of cabotegravir, each INSTI is US Food and Drug Administration approved for treatment-naïve individuals initiating antiretroviral therapy. All of the INSTIs, except raltegravir, are approved for antiretroviral treatment simplification for virologically suppressed patients without INSTI resistance. Data also support the use of dolutegravir and raltegravir in individuals with antiretroviral resistance as part of an optimized antiretroviral regimen. INSTIs are generally well tolerated by people living with HIV compared with older classes of antiretrovirals, but emerging data suggest that some INSTIs contribute to weight gain. Due to their efficacy, safety, and ease of use, HIV treatment guidelines recommend oral INSTIs as preferred components of antiretroviral therapy for individuals initiating therapy. The newest INSTI, cabotegravir, represents an alternative to oral administration of life-long antiretroviral therapy with the availability of a long-acting injectable formulation. This review summarizes the current use of INSTIs in adults living with HIV, highlighting the similarities and differences within the class related to pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety, dosing, and administration that contribute to their role in modern antiretroviral therapy.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40265-020-01379-9;9.4;9.2;9.6;00126667;;;;

Viroporins like HIV-1 Vpu, Alphavirus 6 K, Influenza M2, HCV p7, and Picornavirus 2B, form discrete aqueous passageways which mediate ion and small molecule transport in infected cells. The alterations in host membrane structures induced by viroporins is essential for key steps in the virus life cycle like entry, replication and egress. Any disruption in viroporin functionality severely compromises viral pathogenesis. The envelope (E) protein encoded by coronaviruses is a viroporin with ion channel activity and has been shown to be crucial for the assembly and pathophysiology of coronaviruses. We used a combination of virtual database screening, molecular docking, all-atom molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA analysis to test four FDA approved drugs - Tretinoin, Mefenamic Acid, Ondansetron and Artemether - as potential inhibitors of ion channels formed by SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Interaction and binding energy analysis showed that electrostatic interactions and polar solvation energy were the major driving forces for binding of the drugs, with Tretinoin being the most promising inhibitor. Tretinoin bound within the lumen of the channel formed by E protein, which is lined by hydrophobic residues like Phe, Val and Ala, indicating its potential for blocking the channel and inhibiting the viroporin functionality of E. In control simulations, tretinoin demonstrated a lower binding energy with a known target as compared to SARS-CoV-2 E protein. This work thus highlights the possibility of exploring Tretinoin as a potential SARS-CoV-2 E protein ion channel blocker and virus assembly inhibitor, which could be an important therapeutic strategy in the treatment for coronaviruses.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010482520303942;3.9;4.4;5.4;00104825;S0010482520303942;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0010482520303942;;

Different KDMs have distinct oncogenic functions based on their cellular localization, stimulating cancer cell proliferation, reducing the expression of tumor suppressors, and/or promoting the development of drug resistance. JIB-04 is a small molecule that pan-selectively inhibits KDMs, showing maximal inhibitory activity against KDM5A, and as secondary targets, KDM4D/4B/4A/6B/4C. Recently, it was found that JIB-04 also potently and selectively blocks HIV-1 Tat expression, transactivation, and virus replication in T cell lines via the inhibition of a new target, serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2. Pharmacokinetic characterization and an analytical method for the quantification of JIB-04 are necessary for the further development of this small molecule. Herein, a sensitive, specific, fast and reliable UHPLC-MS/MS method for the quantification of JIB-04 in rat plasma samples was developed and fully validated using a SCIEX 6500+ triple QUAD LC–MS system equipped with an ExionLC UHPLC unit. The chromatographic separation was achieved on a reverse phase ACE Excel 2 Super C18 column with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min under gradient elution. The calibration curves were linear (r2 > 0.999) over concentrations from 0.5 to 1000 ng/mL. The accuracy (RE%) was between -7.4% and 3.7%, and the precision (CV%) was 10.2% or less. The stability data showed that no significant degradation occurred under the experimental conditions. This method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of JIB-04 in rat plasma after intravenous and oral administration and the oral bioavailability of JIB-04 was found to be 44.4%.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0731708520314734;5.5;5.1;5.5;07317085;S0731708520314734;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0731708520314734;;

Few studies have examined integration in lymphoid tissue, where HIV predominantly persists before and after antiretroviral treatment (ART). Of particular interest is whether integration site distributions differ between infection stages with paired blood and tissue comparisons. Here, we profiled HIV integration site distributions in sorted memory, tissue-resident, and/or follicular helper CD4+ T cell subsets from paired blood and lymphoid tissue samples from acute, chronic, and ART-treated individuals. We observed minor differences in the frequency of nonintronic and nondistal intergenic sites, varying with tissue and residency phenotypes during ART. Genomic and epigenetic annotations were generally similar. Clonal expansion of cells marked by identical integration sites was detected, with increased detection in chronic and ART-treated individuals. However, overlap between or within CD4+ T cell subsets or tissue compartments was only observed in 8 unique sites of the 3540 sites studied. Together, these findings suggest that shared integration sites between blood and tissue may, depending on the tissue site, be the exception rather than the rule and indicate that additional studies are necessary to fully understand the heterogeneity of tissue-sequestered HIV reservoirs.;https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/139783;0;2.6;5.8;;;;;

Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 licenseDetection of viral DNA by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a first line of defence leading to the production of type I interferon (IFN). As HIV-1 replication is not a strong inducer of IFN, we hypothesised that an intact capsid physically cloaks viral DNA from cGAS. To test this, we generated defective viral particles by treatment with HIV-1 protease inhibitors or by genetic manipulation of gag. These viruses had defective Gag cleavage, reduced infectivity and diminished capacity to saturate TRIM5. Importantly, unlike wild-type HIV-1, infection with cleavage defective HIV-1 triggered an IFN response in THP-1 cells that was dependent on viral DNA and cGAS. An IFN response was also observed in primary human macrophages infected with cleavage defective viruses. Infection in the presence of the capsid destabilising small molecule PF-74 also induced a cGAS-dependent IFN response. These data demonstrate a protective role for capsid and suggest that antiviral activity of capsid- and protease-targeting antivirals may benefit from enhanced innate and adaptive immunity in vivo.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.15252/embj.2019103958;15.0;15.5;16.4;02614189;;;;

Although PF74 confers mechanistically distinct antiviral phenotypes by competing against host factors for CA binding, it suffers from prohibitively low metabolic stability. Therefore, there has been increasing interest in designing novel sub-chemotypes of PF74 with similar binding mode and improved metabolic stability. We report herein our efforts to explore the inter-domain interacting indole moiety for designing novel CA-targeting small molecules. Our design includes simple substitution on the indole ring, and more importantly, novel sub-chemotypes with the indole moiety replaced with a few less electron-rich rings. All 56 novel analogs were synthesized and evaluated for antiviral activity, cytotoxicity, and impact on CA hexamer stability. Selected analogs were tested for metabolic stability in liver microsomes. Molecular modeling was performed to verify compound binding to the PF74 site. In the end, 5-hydroxyindole analogs (8,9 and 12) showed improved potency (up to 20-fold) over PF74. Of the novel sub-chemotypes, - and -naphthyl analogs (33 and 27) exhibited sub micromolar antiviral potencies comparable to that of PF74. Interestingly, although only moderately inhibiting HIV-1 (single-digit micromolar EC50s), analogs of the 2-indolone sub-chemotype consistently lowered the melting point (Tm) of CA hexamers, some with improved metabolic stability over PF74.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0223523420305985;7.7;7.7;8.3;02235234;S0223523420305985;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0223523420305985;;

Moreover, the noncytotoxic CD8+ T cell antiviral response is a primary mediator of natural HIV control such as that seen in HIV elite controllers and long-term nonprogressors that does not require combined antiretroviral therapy. In this study, we investigated the biological factors contributing to the noncytotoxic control of HIV replication mediated by primary human CD8+ T cells. We report that canonical Wnt signaling inhibits HIV transcription in an MHC-independent, noncytotoxic manner and that mediators of this pathway correlate with HIV controller clinical status. We show that CD8+ T cells express all 19 Wnts and CD8+ T cell–conditioned medium (CM) induced canonical Wnt signaling in infected recipient cells while simultaneously inhibiting HIV transcription. Antagonizing canonical Wnt activity in CD8+ T cell CM resulted in increased HIV transcription in infected cells. Further, Wnt2b expression was upregulated in HIV controllers versus viremic patients, and in vitro depletion of Wnt2b and/or Wnt9b from CD8+ CM reversed HIV inhibitory activity. Finally, plasma concentration of Dkk-1, an antagonist of canonical Wnt signaling, was higher in viremic patients with lower CD4 counts. This study demonstrates that canonical Wnt signaling inhibits HIV and significantly correlates with HIV controller status.

All Rights Reserved.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vif recruits a cellular ubiquitin ligase complex to degrade antiviral APOBEC3 enzymes (APOBEC3C-H) and PP2A phosphatase regulators (PPP2R5A to PPP2R5E). While APOBEC3 antagonism is the canonical function of HIV-1 Vif, this viral accessory protein is also known to trigger G2/M cell cycle arrest. Vif initiates G2/M arrest by degrading multiple PPP2R5 family members, an activity prevalent among diverse HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolates. Here, computational protein-protein docking was used to delineate a Vif/CBF-/PPP2R5 complex in which Vif is predicted to bind the same PPP2R5 surface as physiologic phosphatase targets. This model was tested using targeted mutagenesis of amino acid residues within or adjacent to the putative interface to show loss or retention, respectively, of Vif-induced PPP2R5 degradation activity. Additionally, expression of a peptide that mimics cellular targets of PPP2R5s robustly inhibited Vif-mediated degradation of PPP2R5A but not APOBEC3G. Moreover, live-cell imaging studies examining Vif-mediated degradation of PPP2R5A and APOBEC3G within the same cell revealed that PPP2R5A degradation kinetics are comparable to those of APOBEC3G with a half-life of roughly 6 h postinfection, demonstrating that Vif can concurrently mediate the degradation of distinct cellular substrates. Finally, experiments with a panel of patient-derived Vif isolates indicated that PPP2R5A degradation activity is common in patient-derived isolates. Taken together, these results support a model in which PPP2R5 degradation and global changes in the cellular phosphoproteome are likely to be advantageous for viral pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE A critical function of HIV-1 Vif is to counteract the family of APOBEC3 innate immune proteins. It is also widely accepted that Vif induces G2/M cell cycle arrest in several different cell types. Recently, it has been shown that Vif degrades multiple PPP2R5 phosphoregulators to induce the G2/M arrest phenotype. Here, computational approaches are used to test a structural model of the Vif/PPP2R5 complex. In addition, imaging studies are used to show that Vif degrades these PPP2R5 substrates in roughly the same time frame as APOBEC3 degradation and that this activity is prevalent in patient-derived Vif isolates. These studies are important by further defining PPP2R5 proteins as a bona fide substrate of HIV-1 Vif.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/21/e00631-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

We have previously shown that activation of the noncanonical NF-B pathway using an inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP), AZD5582, reverses HIV/simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) latency. Here, we combined AZD5582 with bispecific HIVxCD3 DART molecules to determine the impact of this approach on persistence. Rhesus macaques (RMs) (n = 13) were infected with simian/human immunodeficiency virus SHIV.C.CH505.375H.dCT, and triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) was initiated after 16 weeks. After 42 weeks of ART, 8 RMs received a cocktail of 3 HIVxCD3 DART molecules having human A32, 7B2, or PGT145 anti-HIV-1 envelope (Env) specificities paired with a human anti-CD3 specificity that is rhesus cross-reactive. The remaining 5 ART-suppressed RMs served as controls. For 10 weeks, a DART molecule cocktail was administered weekly (each molecule at 1 mg/kg of body weight), followed 2 days later by AZD5582 (0.1 mg/kg). DART molecule serum concentrations were well above those considered adequate for redirected killing activity against Env-expressing target cells but began to decline after 3 to 6 weekly doses, coincident with the development of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) against each of the DART molecules. The combination of AZD5582 and the DART molecule cocktail did not increase on-ART viremia or cell-associated SHIV RNA in CD4+ T cells and did not reduce the viral reservoir size in animals on ART. The lack of latency reversal in the model used in this study may be related to low pre-ART viral loads (median, <105 copies/ml) and low preintervention reservoir sizes (median, <102 SHIV DNA copies/million blood CD4+ T cells). Future studies to assess the efficacy of Env-targeting DART molecules or other clearance agents to reduce viral reservoirs after latency reversal may be more suited to models that better minimize immunogenicity and have a greater viral burden. IMPORTANCE The most significant barrier to an HIV-1 cure is the existence of the latently infected viral reservoir that gives rise to rebound viremia upon cessation of ART. Here, we tested a novel combination approach of latency reversal with AZD5582 and clearance with bispecific HIVxCD3 DART molecules in SHIV.C.CH505-infected, ART-suppressed rhesus macaques. We demonstrate that the DART molecules were not capable of clearing infected cells in vivo, attributed to the lack of quantifiable latency reversal in this model with low levels of persistent SHIV DNA prior to intervention as well as DART molecule immunogenicity.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/21/e00793-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

These proteins rearrange to form infectious virus particles. In this study, the solution structure and dynamics of a monomeric mutated domain encompassing the C-terminal of capsid, the spacer peptide SP1 and the nucleocapsid from Gag was characterized by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance in the presence of maturation inhibitor EP39, a more hydro-soluble derivative of BVM. We show that the binding of EP39 decreases the dynamics of CA-SP1 junction, especially the QVT motif in SP1, and perturbs the natural coil-helix equilibrium on both sides of the SP1 domain by stabilizing the transient alpha helical structure. Our results provide new insight into the structure and dynamics of the SP1 domain and how HIV-1 maturation inhibitors interfere with this domain. They offer additional clues for the development of new second generation inhibitors targeting HIV-1 maturation.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0223523420306061;7.7;7.7;8.3;02235234;S0223523420306061;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0223523420306061;;

We assessed patterns of recently acquired HIV infection in US blood donors, including before and after the implementation of the 12-month deferral for men who have sex with men (MSM). Study Design and Methods: A large convenience sample of donations from donors testing HIV-1 nucleic acid testing (NAT) and serology-reactive were further tested with the Sedia HIV-1 Limiting Antigen enzyme immunoassay. Samples were analyzed across available demographic and donation data to provide an assessment of recently acquired HIV infection in US blood donors from 2010 to 2018. Results: Overall, 317 of 1154 (27.5%; 95% confidence interval, 24.9%-30.1%) donations from HIV NAT and serology-reactive donors had recently acquired HIV infection. There was no evidence of change in the percentages of recent HIV infection by year over the study period, either in all donors or in male donors, including after the MSM policy change. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, donors aged 24 years or younger were over 2.7 times more likely and repeat donors 2.2 times more likely to have recently acquired HIV infection compared to donors aged 55 years or older and first-time donors, respectively. Conclusion: Patterns of recently acquired HIV infection varied by demographics but not over time.

Recent research suggests that risk scores for women aged 18-45 may not predict risk well among young women aged 18-24. We evaluated the predictive performance of age-specific risk scores compared with the existing non-age-specific VOICE risk score, developed for women aged 18-45. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the Evidence for Contraceptive Options and HIV Outcomes Trial to develop and internally validate HIV-1 risk scores for women aged 18-24 and 25-35 in South Africa. Candidate predictors included baseline demographic, clinical, behavioral, and contextual characteristics readily available in clinical settings. The VOICE risk score was applied to women aged 18-35. We evaluated predictive performance of each risk score by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: Predictive performance of all risk scores was moderate, with AUC (95% confidence interval) of 0.64 (0.60 to 0.67) among women aged 18-24, 0.68 (0.62 to 0.73) among those aged 25-35, and 0.61 (0.58 to 0.65) for the VOICE risk score applied to women aged 18-35; The AUC was similar in internal validation. Among women aged 18-24, HIV-1 incidence was high even at low risk scores, at 3.9 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval: 3.2 to 4.7).

However, the impact of pre-existing Mtb infection on subsequent HIV infection has not been fully explored. We hypothesized that Mtb infection creates an immunological environment that influences the course of HIV infection, and we investigated whether pre-existing Mtb infection impacts the susceptibility of CD4+ T cells to HIV-1 infection. METHODS: Plasma and blood CD4+ T cells isolated from HIV-negative individuals across the Mtb infection spectrum and non-Mtb-infected control individuals were analyzed for inflammation markers and T-cell phenotypes. CD4+ T cells were infected with HIV-1 in vitro and were monitored for viral replication. RESULTS: We observed differences in proinflammatory cytokines and the relative proportion of memory T-cell subsets depending on Mtb infection status. CD4+ T cells derived from individuals with latent Mtb infection supported more efficient HIV-1 transcription, release, and replication. Enhanced HIV-1 replication correlated with higher percentages of CD4+ TEM and TTD cells. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existing Mtb infection creates an immunological environment that reflects Mtb infection status and influences the susceptibility of CD4+ T cells to HIV-1 replication. These findings provide cellular and molecular insights into how pre-existing Mtb infection influences HIV-1 pathogenesis.;https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/222/9/1550/5838261;10.4;9.2;9.0;;;;;

The Box-Behnken design was utilized to optimize three high-risk factors, namely, Efa amount, sonication time for primary emulsion, and sonication time for aqueous nanodispersion obtained from preliminary studies. Lyophilized Efa-Enf Co-loaded PLN using trehalose elicited spherical morphology, drug amorphization on incorporation, and absence of drug-excipient interaction. In vitro release studies revealed an sustained release of both the drugs from PLN with the differential release profile. Efa-Enf Co-loaded PLN exhibited low hemolytic, platelet and leukocyte aggregation as well as low cytotoxicity in Jurkat E6.1 T-cells and U937 macrophage cells. Circular dichroism spectra confirmed the presence of an -helix form of Enf after encapsulation in PLN.

However, subcutaneous administration caused non-uniform biodistribution after 3 days, eliciting a long-acting slow release from the injection site depot until day 5 in the infection-spread site (lymph nodes and FRT), reservoir sites (liver and spleen) and the difficult-to-access site (brain).

We conducted a cross-sectional study of risk factors for non-uptake of VL testing in rural Uganda. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of uptake of VL testing among randomly selected people with HIV (PWH) receiving anti-retroviral treatment (ART) for at least 6 months at all eight primary health centers in Gomba district, rural Uganda. Socio-demographic and clinical data were extracted from medical records for the period January to December 2017. VL testing was routinely performed 6 months after ART initiation and 12 months thereafter for PWH stable on ART. We used descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with non-uptake of VL testing (the primary outcome). Results: Of 414 PWH, 60% were female, and the median age was 40 years (interquartile range [IQR] 31-48). Most (62.3%) had been on ART > 2 years, and the median duration of treatment was 34 months (IQR 14-55). Thirty three percent did not receive VL testing: 36% of women and 30% of men. Shorter duration of ART (2 years) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.38; 95% CI:1.37-4.12; p = 0.002), younger age 16-30 years (AOR 2.74; 95% CI:1.44-5.24; p = 0.002) and 31-45 years (AOR 1.92; 95% CI 1.12-3.27; p = 0.017), and receipt of ART at Health Center IV (AOR 2.85; 95% CI: 1.78-4.56; p < 0.001) were significantly associated with non-uptake of VL testing. Conclusions: One-in-Three PWH on ART missed VL testing in rural Uganda. Strategies to improve coverage of VL testing, such as VL focal persons to flag missed tests, patient education and demand creation for VL testing are needed, particularly for recent ART initiates and younger persons on treatment, in order to attain the third Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 95-95-95 target-virologic suppression for 95% of PWH on ART.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05461-1;4.5;4.3;4.1;;;;;

The current therapeutic interventions for AIDS have limited efficacy because they are unable to clear HIV infections and the continuous occurrence of resistant HIV strains. Therefore, the exploitation of new drugs to prevent the spread of AIDS remains a high priority. In this study, the effects of icariin and its metabolite anhydroicaritin on SIV/HIV replication were investigated. In CEM × 174 cells and PBMC cells, both icariin and anhydroicaritin can significantly inhibit HIV-1 or SIVmac251 replication. Furthermore, molecular docking studies revealed that icariin and anhydroicaritin can act on both HIV reverse transcriptase and protease but could not bind to integrase. Reverse transcriptase and protease inhibition biological assays showed that both icariin and anhydroicaritin could significantly inhibit only HIV reverse transcriptase. In summary, the two compounds can significantly inhibit HIV/SIV in vitro and their targets may be mainly involved with HIV reverse transcriptase.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014299920304192;5.7;5.9;5.5;00142999;S0014299920304192;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0014299920304192;;

There was a negative impact of self-reported lipodystrophy on body image, where female was more critical, although it was significant for male (p = 0.014). BMI revealed excess weight in female (p = 0.058). Hip waist ratio was shown to be a better parameter than abdominal perimeter when measuring fat in central region of male and lipohypertrophy was characterized in both sexes. There was lipoatrophy in upper and lower limbs for individuals of the (G1) and the male of this group presented hypertriglyceridemia, (p = 0.012). There was a difference in sex, pattern of self–perceived morphologic alterations and feeling in relation to body image when associated with self–reported lipodystrophy, ART use, anthropometric and lipemic profile.";https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540121.2019.1687832;3.8;3.5;3.8;09540121;;;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Interferons play a critical role in the innate immune response against a variety of pathogens, such as HIV1. Recent studies have shown that long noncoding genes are part of a reciprocal feedforward/feedback relationship with interferon expression. They presumably contribute to the cell type specificity of the interferon response, such as the phenotypic and functional transition of macrophages throughout the immune response. However, no comprehensive understanding exists today about the IFN–lncRNA interplay in macrophages, also a sanctuary for latent HIV1. Therefore, we completed a polyA+ RNAseq analysis on monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) treated with members of all three types of IFNs (IFN, IFN, IFN- or IFN) and on macrophages infected with HIV1, revealing an extensive noncoding IFN and/or HIV1 response. Moreover, coexpression correlation with mRNAs was used to identify important (long) noncoding hub genes within IFN or HIV1associated gene clusters. This study identified and prioritized IFN related hub lncRNAs for further functional validation.;https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/20/7741;5.1;5.2;5.3;16616596;;;;

Furthermore, the effects of Tat have been addressed in numerous studies to investigate the molecular events associated with neuronal cells survival and death. Here, we discovered that exposure of rat primary neurons to Tat resulted in the up-regulation of an uncharacterized long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), LOC102549805 (lncRNA-U1). Our observations showed that increased expression of lncRNA-U1 in neurons disrupts bioenergetic pathways by dysregulating homeostasis of Ca2+, mitigating mitochondrial oxygen reduction, and decreasing ATP production, all of which point mitochondrial impairment in neurons via the Tat-mediated lncRNA-U1 induction. These changes were associated with imbalances in autophagy and apoptosis pathways. Additionally, this study showed the ability of Tat to modulate expression of the neuropeptide B/W receptor 1 (NPBWR1) gene via up-regulation of lncRNA-U1. Collectively, our results identified Tat-mediated lncRNA-U1 upregulation resulting in disruption of neuronal homeostasis.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-020-03033-4;9.4;6.8;8.0;;;;;

Vpu downmodulates CD4 in infected cells, and it targets the newly synthesized CD4 molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum. The aim of this study was to identify the level of genetic changes in the Vpu gene from HIV-1-infected North Indian individuals and determine the functional relevance with respect to the CD4 downregulation potential of this protein. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the Vpu gene was polymerase chain reaction amplified with specific primers followed by cloning, sequencing, and sequence analyses using bioinformatic tools for predicting HIV-1 subtypes, recombination events, conservation of domains, and phosphorylation sites. Among all Vpu variants, three of the variants having serine substitution (serine-52 and serine-56 conversion to isoleucine; S52I and S56I) had lost their functional -TrcP binding motif. However, the specific determinants for CD4 (V20, W22, S23) and BST-2 (A11, A15, I17, and A19) binding remained highly conserved. The data obtained with Vpu mutants recommend that the serine residue substitutions in cytoplasmic domain distress the CD4 downregulation activity of Vpu. These events are likely to have implications for viral pathogenesis and vaccine formulations.";https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/biores.2020.0023;4.2;5.0;5.2;;;;;

DESIGN: Collection of dried blood spots from mother-infant pairs during routine HIV-1 screens in Lusaka, Zambia from 2015 to 2018. METHODS: DNA was extracted from the dried blood spots, the HIV-1 pol region was amplified, and the purified proviral DNA was sequenced using Sanger sequencing. Drug resistance mutations (DRM) were identified in sequenced DNA using the Stanford HIVdb (https://hivdb.stanford.edu/). RESULTS: DRM were detected in 45% (44/97) of samples, and these samples were found to harbor resistance to at least two antiretrovirals. The prevalence of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance was significantly higher than that of other antiretroviral classes. DRM were detected disproportionately in infants (67%; 33/49) compared with mothers (23%; 11/48), but the magnitude of resistance did not differ when resistance was detected. The disparity in drug resistance profiles was reinforced in pairwise comparison of resistance profiles in mother-infant pairs. CONCLUSION: While Option B+ is effective in reducing mother-to-child transmission, in cases where this regimen fails, high-level nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance is frequently detected in infants. This underscores the importance of pretreatment drug resistance screening in both mothers and infants and emphasizes the necessary change to protease inhibitor-based and integrase inhibitor-based regimens for treatment of HIV-1-infected infants and mothers.";https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAD.0000000000002614;8.8;7.1;7.5;;;;;

We therefore aimed to look for evidence of HIV-1 evolution in patients who initiated ART at the time of primary HIV-1 infection (PHI). DESIGN: We included retrospectively 20 patients diagnosed at PHI, treated at the time of acute infection and with subsequent effective long-term suppressive ART (HIV viral load <20 copies/ml during at least 5 years without any blips). METHODS: Longitudinal blood samples were deep sequenced using Illumina Miseq. Drug-resistance-associated mutations were retained at 2% cutoff and interpreted using the latest Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le Sida et les Hépatites Virales resistance algorithm. Viral evolution was established when temporal structure on maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree and significant change over time of HIV-1 genetic diversity measured as the average pairwise distance was observed. RESULTS: Emergences or disappearances of drug-resistance-associated mutations were detected in the blood cells during follow-up despite sustained virological control. In all patients, tree topologies showed an absence of segregation between sequences and blood viral populations from all time-points were intermingled. Comparison of the average pairwise distance showed the absence of significant viral diversity at the time of primary infection and afterwards during 5 years of full virological control under ART. CONCLUSION: Despite a slight variation of minority resistance-associated mutation variants, there was no clear evidence of viral evolution during a prolonged period of time in this population of highly controlled adult patients treated at time of PHI.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAD.0000000000002629;8.8;7.1;7.5;;;;;

A key function of guideline development is to identify areas in which further evidence is needed because filling these gaps will lead to future improvements in population health. The objective of this study was to examine the knowledge gaps and research questions for addressing those gaps generated through the WHO guideline development process, with the goal of informing future strategies for improving and strengthening the guideline development process. Study design: We did a systematic, retrospective analysis of research questions identified in the published guidelines. Methods: We analyzed guidelines published between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2018, by the Communicable Diseases Cluster in five disease areas: tuberculosis (TB), HIV, malaria, TB-HIV, and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Research questions were extracted independently by two researchers. We analyzed the distribution of research questions by disease and by topic category and did a qualitative assessment of optimum practice for research question generation during the guideline development process. Results: A total of 48 guidelines were included: 26 on HIV, 1 on malaria, 11 on TB, 5 on TB/HIV, and 5 on NTDs. Overall, 36 (75%) guidelines encompassed a total of 360 explicit research questions; the remainder did not contain specific research questions. The number of research questions that focused on TB was 49, TB/HIV was 38, HIV was 250, and NTDs was 23. The number of research questions that focused on diagnosis was 43 (11.9%) of 360, prevention was 62 (17.2%), treatment was 103 (28.6%), good practice was 12 (3.3%), service delivery was 86 (23.8%), and other areas was 54 (15%). Research questions were often not formulated in a specific or actionable way and were hard to identify in the guideline. Examples of good practice identified by the review team involved the generation of specific and narrowly defined research questions, with accompanying recommendations for appropriate study design. Conclusions: The WHO must strengthen its approach to identifying and presenting research questions during the guideline development process. Ensuring access to research questions is a key next step in adding value to the guideline development process.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0033350620300925;2.4;2.9;3.3;00333506;S0033350620300925;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0033350620300925;;

Although SAPNs expressed in E. coli elicited anti-V1V2 antibodies, the Env protein is heavily glycosylated. In this study the technology has been adapted for expression in mammalian cells. SAPNs containing a V1V2 loop from a B-subtype transmitter/founder virus were expressed in E. coli, ExpiCHO, and Expi293 cells. Independent of the expression host, particles were well-formed. All SAPNs raised high titers of V1V2-specific antibodies, however, SAPNE.coli induced a mainly anti-V1 response, while SAPNExpiCHO and SAPNExpi293 induced a predominantly anti-V2 response. In an ADCP assay, sera from animals immunized with the SAPNExpiCHO or SAPNExpi293 induced a significant increase in phagocytic activity. This novel way of producing SAPNs displaying glycosylated epitopes could increase the antibody titer, functional activity, and shift the immune response towards the desired pathway.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S154996342030109X;10.5;10.8;10.3;15499634;S154996342030109X;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S154996342030109X;;

Thus, novel, accurate and cost-effective tools for viral load monitoring become crucial to allow specific diagnostics and the effective monitoring of the associated antiviral therapies. Herein, we report an effective combination of a (1) padlock probe (PLP)-mediated rolling circle amplification (RCA) bioassay and an (2) agarose bead-based microfluidic device for the affinity chromatography-based capture and detection of RCA products (RCPs) pre-labelled simultaneously with biotin and an organic fluorophore. This method allowed the efficient capture of ~1 m-sized RCPs followed by their quantification either as discrete signals or an average fluorescence signal, thus being compatible with both high-resolution imaging for maximum sensitivity as well as simpler optical detection setups. A limit of detection < 30 fM was obtained for HIV-1 synthetic target with just a single round of RCA, comparable to recently reported procedures requiring technically complex amplification strategies such as hyperbranching and/or enzymatic digestion/amplification. Furthermore, targeting a set of five conserved regions in the HIV-1 gag gene, the method could specifically detect HIV-1 in 293T cell culture supernatants, as well as a set of 11 HIV-1 NIH reference samples with four different subtypes. The reported method provides simplicity of operation, unique versatility of signal transduction (i.e. average or discrete signals), and potential coupling with previously reported miniaturized photodetectors. These combined features hold promise for bringing RCA-based molecular diagnostics closer to the point-of-care.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S095656632030436X;14.2;15.8;17.6;09565663;S095656632030436X;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S095656632030436X;;

We performed a pilot clinical study of 20 women with circulating 25(OH)D levels <62.5 nmol/L. Participants were randomized into either weekly or daily high-dose oral vitamin D supplementation groups. In addition to serum vitamin D levels, genital mucosal endpoints, including soluble mediators, immune cell populations, gene expression, and ex vivo HIV-1 infection, were assessed. While systemic vitamin D levels showed a significant increase following supplementation, these changes translated into modest effects on the cervicovaginal factors studied. Paradoxically, post-supplementation vitamin D levels were decreased in cervicovaginal fluids. Given the strong correlation between vitamin D status and HIV-1 infection and the widespread nature of vitamin D deficiency, further understanding of the role of vitamin D immunoregulation in the female reproductive tract is important.;https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/10/3176;4.8;5.0;5.2;;;;;

Although the presence of gRNA in virions is required for viral infectivity, in its absence, Gag can assemble around cellular RNAs and form particles resembling gRNA-containing particles. When gRNA is expressed, it is selectively packaged despite the presence of excess host RNA, but how it is selectively packaged is not understood. Specific recognition of a gRNA packaging signal (Psi) has been proposed to stimulate the efficient nucleation of viral assembly. However, the heterogeneity of Gag-RNA interactions renders capturing this transient nucleation complex using traditional structural biology approaches challenging. Here, we used native MS to investigate RNA binding of wild-type (WT) Gag and Gag lacking the p6 domain (Gagp6). Both proteins bind to Psi RNA primarily as dimers, but to a control RNA primarily as monomers. The dimeric complexes on Psi RNA require an intact dimer interface within Gag. Gagp6 binds to Psi RNA with high specificity in vitro and also selectively packages gRNA in particles produced in mammalian cells. These studies provide direct support for the idea that Gag binding to Psi specifically promotes nucleation of Gag-Gag interactions at the early stages of immature viral particle assembly in a p6-independent manner.;http://www.jbc.org/lookup/doi/10.1074/jbc.RA120.014835;8.2;7.7;7.4;;;;;

Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdThere are only scattered case reports documenting belatacept use in HIV + kidney transplant recipients. We performed a retrospective review to describe short-term outcomes following conversion to belatacept in a cohort of HIV + patients. Patients were included if they were converted to belatacept between May 2015 and May 2019, had an HIV- donor, and received 4 doses of belatacept. All patients were treated with non-depleting induction and triple maintenance immunosuppression. Allograft and HIV-related outcomes were collected from the date of belatacept infusion until May 2020. Ten HIV + kidney transplant recipients were identified, who were converted to belatacept a median of 364 days post-transplant. At last follow-up (median 3.3 years), 8 patients remained on belatacept therapy, and all patients were alive with functioning allografts. Mean estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) improved from 31.6 mL/min at baseline to 42.8 mL/min at 1 year (P =.03). Two patients developed acute rejection, with one necessitating conversion back to tacrolimus. All patients maintained undetectable HIV-1 viral loads at last follow-up. One patient each developed pneumocystis pneumonia and Kaposi sarcoma following conversion, which were responsive to standard medical therapy. In our cohort of stable HIV + kidney transplant recipients, conversion to belatacept was associated with excellent early patient and allograft survival and improved eGFR at 1 year.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ctr.14041;2.7;2.4;2.6;09020063;;;;

HIV Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British HIV AssociationObjectives: As per National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) estimates, there are 2.1 million people living with HIV (PWH) in India, of whom 1.2 million are on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study explored the use of a single-tablet regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg + lamivudine 300 mg + efavirenz 400 mg (TLE400 STR) as a first-line switch strategy in PWH in Pune, India. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in private sector ART clinics in three tertiary-level hospitals in Pune, India. PWH > 12 years of age (n = 502) who initiated first-line ART (predominantly TLE600 STR), completed  6 months of follow-up and achieved virological suppression [plasma viral load (VL) < 1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL] were identified and switched to TLE400 STR. The virological and immunological efficacy of TLE400 STR at 6 and 12 months of follow-up were noted. Grade 3/4 adverse events (especially efavirenz-related neuropsychiatric adverse events) leading to regimen discontinuation were also noted. Results: Of 502 PWH who switched to TLE400 STR, complete virological suppression (VL < 20 copies/mL) was maintained in more than 97% of patients at follow-up. TLE400 STR was successful in maintaining CD4 counts within the range observed at the start of the regimen. Grade 3/4 adverse events leading to TLE400 STR discontinuation were seen in 11 (2.2%) patients. Virological failure (VL > 1000 copies/mL) and treatment regimen failure were seen in six (1.2%) and 49 (9.8%) subjects, respectively. Conclusions: TLE400 STR exhibits excellent efficacy and safety as a switch strategy and should be introduced in the Indian National ART Program, especially for PWH who are virologically suppressed on TLE600 STR.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hiv.12912;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;;

Enthusiasm for immuno-metabolism in the context of HIV-1 infection, especially among T-cell lineages, continues to grow over time as science opens new therapeutic perspectives to limit viral pathogenesis and to boost anti-viral responses. The idea of “metabolism as a therapeutic target” is called metabolic reprogramming and is based on the use of specific metabolism-targeting drugs that are currently available for cancer therapy. In this review, we will focus on the evidence that shows the key role of mitochondria, the cell's powerhouses, and their ability to use diverse metabolic resources (referred to as metabolic plasticity) in providing optimal immune T-cell protection among HIV-1-infected patients. Conversely, we highlight observations indicating that mitochondria metabolic dysfunction associated with excessive glucose dependency, a phenomenon reported as ""Warburg effect"", results in the inability to mount and maintain effective T-cell-dependent immunity during persistent HIV-1 infection. Therefore, helping mitochondria to regain the metabolic plasticity and allow specific T-cells to adapt and thrive under unfavorable environmental conditions during HIV-1 infection may represent the next generation of combinatory treatment options for patients.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1359610119301741;13.7;12.9;12.1;13596101;S1359610119301741;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1359610119301741;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Fc-mediated effector functions of antibodies, including antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC), have been shown to contribute to vaccine-induced protection from HIV-1 infection, especially those directed against non-neutralizing, CD4 inducible (CD4i) epitopes within the gp120 constant 1 and 2 regions (C1/C2 or Cluster A epitopes). However, recent passive immunization studies have not been able to definitively confirm roles for these antibodies in HIV-1 prevention mostly due to the complications of cross-species Fc–FcR interactions and suboptimal dosing strategies. Here, we use our stabilized gp120 Inner domain (ID2) immunogen that displays the Cluster A epitopes within a minimal structural unit of HIV-1 Env to investigate an immunization protocol that induces a fine-tuned antibody repertoire capable of an effective Fc-effector response. This includes the generation of isotypes and the enhanced antibody specificity known to be vital for maximal Fc-effector activities, while minimizing the induction of isotypes know to be detrimental for these functions. Although our studies were done in in BALB/c mice we conclude that when optimally titrated for the species of interest, ID2 with GLA-SE adjuvant will elicit high titers of antibodies targeting the Cluster A region with potent Fc-mediated effector functions, making it a valuable immunogen candidate for testing an exclusive role of non-neutralizing antibody response in HIV-1 protection in vaccine settings.;https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/8/10/1490;0;0;0.5;;;;;

CCR5-32 deletion and HLA-A/HLA-B alleles were also analyzed. DESIGN: Interruption of ART may be required to investigate the outcome of strategies aimed to achieve drug-free HIV remission or cure. However, interruption of ART is currently not indicated. This was a retrospective longitudinal study that included 57 long-term suppressed HIV-1-infected individuals. METHODS: TLR SNPs were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). CCR5-32 was analyzed by conventional PCR and HLA-A and HLA-B alleles by PCR-SSOP Luminex. RESULTS: HIV-1 RNA rebound at week 4 after treatment interruption positively correlated with pre-ART HIV-1 load (P = 0.025). The TLR9-1635AA genotype was independently associated with a higher HIV-1 rebound compared with those with AG + GG genotype (multivariate stepwise regression analysis, P = 0.004). Women had lower HIV-1 RNA load both at rebound and during the 72 weeks of follow-up compared with men (P < 0.05 at all time-points), whereas CD4 nadir and CD4 count set-point were similar according to sex. The pre-ART viral load was independently associated with the viral set-point (P = 0.001), whereas the presence of the HLA-A01 allele (P = 0.027) and the CD4 nadir (P = 0.001) were associated with the CD4 count set-point. CONCLUSIONS: The association of the TLR9-1635AA genotype with a higher HIV-1 rebound suggests that this SNP may affect the results from strategies requiring interruption of ART aimed to cure HIV-1 infection.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAI.0000000000002437;6.9;7.0;6.4;;;;;

The de novodrug/ligand/molecule design is a powerful and effective approach to design a large number of novel and structurally diverse compounds with the required pharmacological profiles. A crystal structure of HIV-1 integrase bound with standard inhibitor BI-224436 is used and a set of 80,000 compounds through the de novo approach in LigBuilder is designed. Initially, a number of criteria including molecular docking, in-silico toxicity and pharmacokinetics profile assessments are implied to reduce the chemical space. Finally, four de novo designed molecules are proposed as potential HIV-1 integrase inhibitors based on comparative analyses. Notably, strong binding interactions have been identified between a few newly identified catalytic amino acid residues and proposed HIV-1 integrase inhibitors. For evaluation of the dynamic stability of the protein-ligand complexes, a number of parameters are explored from the 100 ns MD simulation study. The MD simulation study suggested that proposed molecules efficiently retained their molecular interaction and structural integrity inside the HIV-1 integrase. The binding free energy is calculated through the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) approach for all complexes and it also explains their thermodynamic stability. Hence, proposed molecules through de novo design might be critical to inhibiting the HIV-1 integrase.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1476927120302413;2.3;2.3;2.8;14769271;S1476927120302413;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1476927120302413;;

The supercharged proteins were known as powerful weapons for delivery of different types of cargoes such as DNA and protein. Hence, we applied B1 protein with + 43 net charges obtained from a single frameshift in the gene encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) for delivery of two multi-epitope DNA constructs (nef-vpu-gp160-p24 and nef-vif-gp160-p24) in vitro and in vivo for the first time. For this purpose, B1 protein was generated in bacterial expression system under native conditions, and used to interact with both DNA constructs. Results: Our data indicated that B1 protein (~ 27 kDa) was able to form a stable nanoparticle (~ 80–110 nm) with both DNA constructs at nitrogen: phosphate (N: P) ratio of 1:1. Moreover, the transfection efficiency of B1 protein for DNA delivery into HEK-293T cell line indicated that the cellular uptake of nef-vif-gp160-p24 DNA/ B1 and nef-vpu-gp160-p24 DNA/ B1 nanoparticles was about 32–35% with lower intensity as compared to TurboFect commercial reagent. On the other hand, immunization of BALB/c mice with different modalities demonstrated that B1 protein could enhance the levels of antibody, IFN-gamma and Granzyme B eliciting potent and strong Th1-directed cellular immunity. Conclusion: Generally, our findings showed the potency of B1 protein as a promising gene delivery system to improve an effective therapeutic vaccine against HIV-1 infection.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10529-020-02918-w;3.6;4.1;4.3;01415492;;;;

MSNPs were synthesized and characterized by various techniques. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry results exhibited efficient uptake of FITC-conjugated MSNPs in TZM-bl cells. The NVP was loaded within MSNPs, and its anti-HIV1 efficacy was assessed on HIV1 (R5 and X4 variants) infected TZM-bl cells and further confirmed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The in vitro assessment of the anti-HIV1 potential of NVP and NVP-MSNPs in HIV1 infected TZM-bl cells and PBMCs showed increased efficacy of NVP upon loading within MSNPs with significant increase in therapeutic index. The increased efficacy against HIV1 was accompanied by reduced cytotoxicity to TZM-bl cells and PBMCs. Further, reverse transcriptase (RT) assay confirmed the inhibitory effect on RTase, which is a key enzyme in HIV-1 replication. The present study showed that entrapment of NVP within MSNPs led to an increased efficacy with reduced cytotoxic effect resulting in the enhanced therapeutic index (TI).;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S092777652030583X;7.2;7.0;7.1;09277765;S092777652030583X;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S092777652030583X;;

All Rights Reserved.In HIV-1, development of resistance to AZT (3=-azido-3=-deoxythymidine) is mediated by the acquisition of thymidine analogue resistance mutations (TAMs) (i.e., M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215F/Y, and K219E/Q) in the viral reverse transcriptase (RT). Clinically relevant combinations of TAMs, such as M41L/T215Y or D67N/ K70R/T215F/K219Q, enhance the ATP-mediated excision of AZT monophosphate (AZTMP) from the 3= end of the primer, allowing DNA synthesis to continue. Additionally, during HIV-1 maturation, the Gag polyprotein is cleaved to release a mature nucleocapsid protein (NCp7) and two intermediate precursors (NCp9 and NCp15). NC proteins interact with the viral genome and facilitate the reverse transcription process. Using wild-type and TAM-containing RTs, we showed that both NCp9 and NCp15 inhibited ATP-mediated rescue of AZTMP-terminated primers annealed to RNA templates but not DNA templates, while NCp7 had no effect on rescue activity. RNase H inactivation by introducing the active-site mutation E478Q led to the loss of the inhibitory effect shown by NCp9. NCp15 had a stimulatory effect on the RT’s RNase H activity not observed with NCp7 and NCp9. However, analysis of RNase H cleavage patterns revealed that in the presence of NCp9, RNA/DNA complexes containing duplexes of 12 bp had reduced stability in comparison with those obtained in the absence of NC or with NCp7 or NCp15. These effects are expected to have a strong influence on the inhibitory action of NCp9 and NCp15 by affecting the efficiency of RNA-dependent DNA polymerization after unblocking DNA primers terminated with AZTMP and other nucleotide analogues.;https://aac.asm.org/content/64/10/e00958-20;7.8;7.9;8.3;00664804;;;;

Alterations in HLA-I/peptide complexes can modulate binding of killer immunoglobuline-like receptors (KIRs) and thereby the function of natural killer (NK) cells. Although multiple studies have provided evidence that HLA-I/KIR interactions play a role in HIV-1 disease progression, the consequence of HIV-1 infection for HLA-I/KIR interactions remain largely unknown. DESIGN: We determined changes in HLA-I presented peptides resulting from HIV-1-infection of primary human CD4 T cells and assessed the impact of changes in peptide repertoires on HLA-I/KIR interactions. METHODS: Liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry to identify HLA-I presented peptides, cell-based in-vitro assays to evaluate functional consequences of alterations in immunopeptidome and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to confirm experimental data. RESULTS: A total of 583 peptides exclusively presented on HIV-1-infected cells were identified, of which only 0.2% represented HIV-1 derived peptides. Focusing on HLA-C*03 : 04/KIR2DL3 interactions, we observed that HLA-C*03 : 04-presented peptides derived from noninfected CD4 T cells mediated stronger binding of inhibitory KIR2DL3 than peptides derived from HIV-1-infected cells. Furthermore, the most abundant peptide presented by HLA-C*03 : 04 on noninfected CD4 T cells (VIYPARISL) mediated the strongest KIR2DL3-binding, while the most abundant peptide presented on HIV-1-infected cells (YAIQATETL) did not mediate KIR2DL3-binding. Molecular dynamics simulations of HLA-C*03 : 04/KIR2DL3 interactions in the context of these two peptides revealed that VIYPARISL significantly enhanced the HLA-C*03 : 04/peptide contact area to KIR2DL3 compared with YAIQATETL. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that HIV-1 infection-induced changes in HLA-I-presented peptides can reduce engagement of inhibitory KIRs, providing a mechanism for enhanced activation of NK cells by virus-infected cells.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAD.0000000000002596;8.8;7.1;7.5;;;;;

However, major challenges still remain in HIV-1 management, especially the emergence of resistant strains and the persistence of viral reservoirs, apparent after cART treatment interruption. Efforts are ongoing to explore the most effective means to intensify cART and successfully control residual viral replication. We anticipate that the reduction by cART of HIV-1 reservoirs could be further enhanced by combining cART with entry inhibitors and drugs that silence CCR5 expression. CCR5-targeting drugs are attractive option because of their low side effects when combined with other antiretroviral drugs. The concept that their inclusion would be effective has been supported by the reduction in two long terminal repeat unintegrated circular DNA, a marker for new infections, when CCR5-targeting drugs are added to standard antiretroviral treatment. This study is, in part, an extension of our previous study demonstrating greater preservation of human CD4+ T-cells and CD4+/CD8+ cell ratios in HIV-infected CD34+ NSG mice when CCR5-targeting drugs were included with standard cART. In this study, we treated HIV-1-infected cell cultures with cART or cART plus CCR5-targeting drugs (maraviroc and rapamycin). We found that treatment intensification with CCR5-targeting drugs led to a significant reduction of HIV-1 replication in peripheral blood ononuclear cells (PBMCs), as judged by measured viral DNA copies and p24 levels. Our data provide proof of principle for the benefit of adding CCR5-targeting drugs to traditional, standard cART to further lower viremia and subsequently reduce viral reservoirs in clinical settings, while potentially lowering side effects by reducing cART concentrations.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2020.0064;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;;

Some of these mutations can elicit escape mutant-specific T cells, but it still remains unclear whether they can suppress the replication of HIV-1 mutants. It is known that HLA-B*52:01-restricted RI8 (Gag 275 to 282; RMYSPTSI) is a protective T cell epitope in HIV-1 subtype B-infected Japanese individuals, though 3 Gag280A/S/V mutations are found in 26% of them. Gag280S and Gag280A were HLA-B*52:01-associated mutations, whereas Gag280V was not, implying a different mechanism for the accumulation of Gag280 mutations. In this study, we investigated the coevolution of HIV-1 with RI8-specific T cells and suppression of HIV-1 replication by its escape mutant-specific T cells both in vitro and in vivo. HLA-B*52:01+ individuals infected with Gag280A/S mutant viruses failed to elicit these mutant epitope-specific T cells, whereas those with the Gag280V mutant one effectively elicited RI8-6V mutant-specific T cells. These RI8-6V-specific T cells suppressed the replication of Gag280V virus and selected wild-type virus, suggesting a mechanism affording no accumulation of the Gag280V mutation in the HLA-B*52:01+ individuals. The responders to wild-type (RI8-6T) and RI8-6V mutant peptides had significantly higher CD4 counts than nonresponders, indicating that the existence of not only RI8-6T-specific T cells but also RI8-6V-specific ones was associated with a good clinical outcome. The present study clarified the role of escape mutant-specific T cells in HIV-1 evolution and in the control of HIV-1. IMPORTANCE Escape mutant-specific CD8+ T cells were elicited in some individuals infected with escape mutants, but it is still unknown whether these CD8+ T cells can suppress HIV-1 replication. We clarified that Gag280V mutation were selected by HLA-B*52:01-restricted CD8+ T cells specific for the GagRI8 protective epitope, whereas the Gag280V virus could frequently elicit GagRI8-6V mutant-specific CD8+ T cells. GagRI8-6V mutant-specific T cells had a strong ability to suppress the replication of the Gag280V mutant virus both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, these T cells contributed to the selection of wild-type virus in HLA-B*52:01+ Japanese individuals. We for the first time demonstrated that escape mutant-specific CD8+ T cells can suppress HIV-1 replication and play an important role in the coevolution with HIV-1. Thus, the present study highlighted an important role of escape mutant-specific T cells in the control of HIV-1 and coevolution with HIV-1.";https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/19/e01151-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The display of nativelike human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope (HIV1 Env) trimers on liposomes has gained wide attention over the last few years. Currently, available methods have enabled the preparation of Envliposome conjugates of unprecedented quality. However, these protocols require the Env trimer to be tagged and/or to carry a specific functional group. For this reason, we have investigated N(3Dimethylaminopropyl)Nethylcarbodiimide/N Hydroxysulfosuccinimide (EDC/SulfoNHS) chemistry for its potential to covalently conjugate tag-free, nonfunctionalized nativelike Env trimers onto the surface of carboxylfunctionalized liposomes. The preservation of the liposome’s physical integrity and the immunogen’s conformation required a finetuned twostep approach based on the controlled use of  mercaptoethanol. The display of Env trimers was strictly limited to activated liposomes of positive charge, i.e., liposomes with a positive zeta potential that carry aminereactive SulfoNHS esters on their surface. In agreement with that, conjugation was found to be highly ionic strength and pH-dependent. Overall, we have identified electrostatic preconcentration (i.e., close proximity between negatively charged Env trimers and positively charged liposomes established through electrostatic attraction) to be crucial for conjugation reactions to proceed. The present study highlights the requirements and limitations of potentially scalable EDC/SulfoNHSbased approaches and represents a solid basis for further research into the controlled conjugation of tagfree, non-functionalized nativelike Env trimers on the surface of liposomes, and other nanoparticles.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/12/10/979;5.2;2.9;2.9;;;;;

We evaluated ADCC mediated by different combinations of 2 to 6 neutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-HIV-1 Envelope (Env) mAbs, using concentrations  1 g/mL, to identify combinations effective at targeting latent reservoir HIV-1 viruses from 10 individuals. We found that within 2 hours, combinations of 3 mAbs mediated more than 30% killing of HIV-infected primary CD4+ T cells in the presence of autologous NK cells, with the combination of A32 (C1C2), DH511.2K3 (MPER), and PGT121 (V3) mAbs being the most effective. Increasing the incubation of target and effector cells in the presence of mAb combinations from 2 to 24 hours resulted in increased specific killing of infected cells, even with neutralization-resistant viruses. The same combination eliminated reactivated latently HIV-1-infected cells in an ex vivo quantitative viral outgrowth assay. Therefore, administration of a combination of 3 mAbs should be considered in planning in vivo studies seeking to eliminate persistently HIV-1-infected cells.;https://www.jci.org/articles/view/135557;21.2;19.0;17.0;00219738;;;;

We aimed to investigate the interaction of migration with the local transmission network in a typical trade area, Yiwu City, the world's largest commodity distribution center. Based on 390 pol sequences from 413 participants diagnosed between 2014 and 2016, putative transmission clusters and the underlying demographic and behavioral characteristics were analyzed. Recent infection status was determined by HIV-1 limiting antigen avidity enzyme immunoassay to identify active clusters. Multiple subtypes were identified, with a predominance of CRF01_AE (47.4%) and CRF07_BC (40.8%), followed by 9 other subtypes and 8 URFs. Multivariable analyses revealed that individuals in clusters were more likely to be local residents, infected through heterosexual behaviors, and infected with CRF01_AE (P < .05). Of men who have sex with men (MSM), 81% were linked to other MSM, and only 3% were linked to heterosexual women. Of heterosexual women, 67% were linked to heterosexual men, and 11% to MSM. Yiwu residents were more likely to link to locals than that of migrants (43% vs 20%, P < .001). By contrast, local MSM and migrant MSM all had high percentages of linkage to migrant MSM (57% vs 69%, P = .069). Our findings reveal that migration promotes the dissemination and dynamic change of HIV, which are interwoven between locals and migrants. The results highlight the far-reaching influence of migrant MSM on the local HIV transmission network.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567134820302070;5.2;4.9;5.0;15671348;S1567134820302070;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1567134820302070;;

Here we review the most promising immunotherapeutic strategies that can be used to target HIV in the CNS and focus on identifying their potential benefits while exploring the challenges that remain in their application. Recent Findings: We have identified five immunotherapeutic strategies that hold potential in managing CNS disease among HIV-infected patients. These include broadly neutralizing antibodies, multi-affinity antibodies, CAR-T cell therapy, checkpoint inhibitors, and therapeutic vaccines. Summary: Each class of immunotherapy presents unique mechanisms by which CNS viremia and latency may be addressed but are faced with several challenges. CAR-T cell therapy and multi-affinity antibodies seem to hold promise, but combination therapy is likely to be most effective. However, more human trials are needed before the clinical benefits of these therapies are realized.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11904-020-00519-w;10.3;0;6.5;15483568;;;;

All Rights Reserved.The envelope glycoprotein (Env) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the sole target of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Several mechanisms, such as the acquisition of mutations, variability of the loop length, and alterations in the glycan pattern, are employed by the virus to shield neutralizing epitopes on Env to sustain survival and infectivity within the host. The identification of mutations that lead to viral evasion of the host immune response is essential for the optimization and engineering of Env-based trimeric immunogens. Here, we report a rare leucine-to-phenylalanine escape mutation (L184F) at the base of hypervariable loop 2 (population frequency of 0.0045%) in a 9-month-old perinatally HIV-1-infected infant broad neutralizer. The L184F mutation altered the trimer conformation by modulating intramolecular interactions stabilizing the trimer apex and led to viral escape from autologous plasma bnAbs and known N160 glycan-targeted bnAbs. The L184F amino acid change led to the acquisition of a relatively open trimeric conformation, often associated with tier 1 HIV-1 isolates and increased susceptibility to neutralization by polyclonal plasma antibodies of weak neutralizers. While there was no impact of the L184F mutation on free virus transmission, a reduction in cell-to-cell transmission was observed. In conclusion, we report a naturally selected viral mutation, L184F, that influenced a change in the conformation of the Env trimer apex as a mechanism of escape from contemporaneous plasma V2 apex-targeted nAbs. Further studies should be undertaken to define viral mutations acquired during natural infection, to escape selection pressure exerted by bnAbs, to inform vaccine design and bnAb-based therapeutic strategies. IMPORTANCE The design of HIV-1 envelope-based immunogens capable of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is currently under active research. Some of the most potent bnAbs target the quaternary epitope at the V2 apex of the HIV-1 Env trimer. By studying naturally circulating viruses from a perinatally HIV-1-infected infant with plasma neutralizing antibodies targeted to the V2 apex, we identified a rare leucine-to-phenylalanine substitution, in two out of six functional viral clones, that destabilized the trimer apex. This single-amino-acid alteration impaired the interprotomeric interactions that stabilize the trimer apex, resulting in an open trimer conformation and escape from broadly neutralizing autologous plasma antibodies and known V2 apex-directed bnAbs, thereby favoring viral evasion of the early bnAb response of the infected host. Defining the mechanisms by which naturally occurring viral mutations influence the sensitivity of HIV-1 to bnAbs will provide information for the development of vaccines and bnAbs as anti-HIV-1 reagents.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/19/e00814-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

Oral cavity is the most commonly PBL affected site. Most oral PBLs presented as asymptomatic swellings, frequently associated with ulcerations and bleeding. Most cases lacked B-symptoms, suggesting a more local involvement of the disease. No standard treatment is yet for oral PBL. Five-year survival rate recorded no more than 33.5%. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 39-year-old male presented to Dental Clinic with 1 month swelling of the oral cavity, in absence of any other symptoms or signs. He followed antibiotic therapy just on suspicion of an oral abscess and later oral surgical treatment on suspicion of bone neoplasm. DIAGNOSIS: Surgical specimen analysis highlighted a diffuse infiltrate of large-sized atypical cells with plasmablastic appearance and plasma cell phenotype. Oral cavity PBL was diagnosed. Blood tests recorded mild lymphopenia and positive human immunodeficiency viruses serology. INTERVENTIONS: Patient underwent chemotherapy including intrathecal methotrexate prophylaxis, in addition to a highly active antiretroviral therapy. OUTCOMES: At 12 months from diagnosis, patient recorded complete hematological remission. CONCLUSIONS: Oral PBL diagnosis requires a high level of suspicion and awareness both by physicians and pathologists.

The longterm effects of HAART on the oral health of children are understudied. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of lopinavir-ritonavir and lamivudine on oral health indicators (dental caries, gingivitis, tooth eruption, and oral health related quality of life) in 5 to 7 year old HIV-1 exposed uninfected children from the ANRS 12174 trial. METHODS: This study used data collected in 2017 among children aged 5 to 7 years from the Ugandan site of the ANRS 12174 randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT00640263) implemented between 2009 and 2012 in Mbale district, Eastern Uganda. The intervention was lopinavir-ritonavir or lamuvudine treatment to prevent vertical HIV-1 transmission. One hundred thirty-seven and 139 children were randomized to receive lopinavir-ritonavir or lamivudine treatment at day 7 postpartum to compare efficacy of prevention of vertical HIV-1 transmission. At follow up, the children underwent oral examination using the World Health Organization methods for field conditions. The oral health related quality of life was assessed using the early childhood oral health impact scale. Negative binomial and logistic regression were used for the analysis of data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dental caries, gingivitis, tooth eruption, and oral health related quality of life) in 5 to 7 year old HIV-1 exposed uninfected children. RESULTS: The prevalence of dental caries was 48% in the study sample: 49% in the lopinavir-ritonavir arm and 48% in the lamivudine treatment group. The corresponding mean decayed missing filled teeth and standard deviation was 1.7 (2.4) and 2.3 (3.7) The mean number (standard deviation) of erupted permanent teeth was 3.8 (3.7) and 4.6 (3.9) teeth in the lopinavir- and lamivudine group, respectively. The prevalence of reported impacts on oral health was 7% in the lopinavir-ritonavir and 18% in the lamivudine group. Gingivitis had a prevalence of 7% in the lopinavir-ritonavir and 14% lamivudine treatment group. The regression analysis revealed 70% less reported impacts on oral health in lopinavir-ritonavir group than the lamivudine treatment group with an incidence rate ratio of 0.3 (95% confidence interval: 0.1-0.9). CONCLUSIONS: HIV exposed uninfected infants in the lopinavir-ritonavir group reported less impacts on oral health than the lamivudine treatment group. Dental caries, gingivitis, and tooth eruption were not significantly affected by the treatment lopinavir-ritonavir or lamivudine. TRIAL REGISTRATION CLINICALTRIALS.

Most KS patients in regions with high incidence such as sub-Saharan Africa present late with advanced stage disease. Admitted KS patients have high mortality rates. Factors associated with mortality of admitted KS patients are poorly defined.We conducted a retrospective file review to ascertain reasons for admission and identify factors associated with mortality of admitted HIV-associated (epidemic) KS patients in Zambia. Baseline study variables were collected, and patients were retrospectively followed from admission to time of discharge or death.Mortality rate for admitted epidemic KS patients was high at 20%. The most common reasons for admission included advanced KS disease, severe anemia, respiratory tract infections, and sepsis. The majority (48%) of admitted patients had advanced clinical stage with visceral involvement on admission. Clinical predictors of mortality on univariate analysis included visceral KS [odds ratio (OR) = 13.74; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.68-113; P = 0.02), fever (OR = 26; 95% CI = 4.85-139; P = .001), and sepsis (OR = 35.56; 95% CI = 6.05-209; P = .001). Baseline hemoglobin levels (5.6 vs 8.2 g/dL; P = .001) and baseline platelet counts (63 x 10^9/L vs 205 x 10^9/L; P = .01) were significantly lower in mortalities vs discharges. Baseline white cell counts were higher in mortalities vs discharges (13.78 x 10^9/L vs 5.58 x 10^9/L; P = .01), and HIV-1 viral loads at the time of admission were higher in mortalities vs discharges (47,607 vs 40 copies/L; P = .02). However, only sepsis (or signs and symptoms of sepsis) were independently associated with mortality after controlling for confounders.In conclusion, common reasons for admission of epidemic KS patients include advanced disease, severe anemia, respiratory tract infections, and signs and symptoms of sepsis.

MazF is an ACA nucleotide sequence-specific endoribonuclease derived from Escherichia coli. The conditional expression of MazF by binding of HIV-1 Tat to the promoter region of a MazF-expression vector has previously been shown to selectively inhibit HIV-1 replication in acutely infected cells. The expression of MazF significantly suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)--induced HIV-1 production and viral RNA expression in the HIV-1 latently infected cell line OM-10.1 transduced with the MazF-expression vector (OM-10.1/MFR). Moreover, the viability of OM-10.1/MFR cells decreased with increasing concentrations of TNF-, whereas such decrease was not observed for HL-60 cells transduced with the MazF-expression vector (HL-60/MFR), the uninfected parental cell line of OM-10.1. TNF- increased the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in OM-10.1/MFR cells, indicating that the cell death was caused by the induction of apoptosis. TNF--induced expression of MazF mRNA was detected in OM-10.1/MFR but not HL-60/MFR cells, suggesting that TNF--induced apoptosis of latently infected cells was due to the expression of MazF. Thus, the anti-HIV-1 gene therapy using the MazF-expression vector may have potential for the cure of HIV-1 infection in combination with suitable latency reversing agents through reducing the size of latently infected cells without viral reactivation.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006291X2031500X;4.4;4.2;4.6;0006291X;S0006291X2031500X;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006291X2031500X;;

Mutating the lysines abolishes integration through decreased 3= processing and inefficient nuclear import of reverse-transcribed genomes. Solution of the crystal structures of wild-type (wt) and mutated CTDs shows that the motif generates a positive surface potential that is important for integration. The number of charges in the motif appears more crucial than their position within the motif. Indeed, the positions of the K's could be permutated or additional K's could be inserted in the motif, generally without affecting integration per se. Despite this potential genetic flexibility, the NKNK arrangement is strictly conserved in natural sequences, indicative of an effective purifying selection exerted at steps other than integration. Accordingly, reverse transcription was reduced even in the mutants that retained wt integration levels, indicating that specifically the wt sequence is optimal for carrying out the multiple functions that integrase exerts. We propose that the existence of several amino acid arrangements within the motif, with comparable efficiencies of integration per se, might have constituted an asset for the acquisition of additional functions during viral evolution.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/20/e01035-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

The epidemiology of this disease indicates that there are three modes of transmission: Blood, mother-to-child, and sexual contact transmission. The pathogen of AIDS is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), primarily HIV-1. HIV-1 could not break through the structurally and functionally integral skin, and primarily invades the human body through the mucosa irrespective of their integrity. Therefore, the mucosae are the natural transmission routes for HIV-1. The mucosae involved in HIV-1 transmission include the mucosae of the gastrointestinal tract and the urogenital tract. The risks of HIV-1 transmission vary significantly between mucosal sites and individuals, and are associated with mucosal integrity, abundance of target cells, immune status of the host, commensal microbes, and host genetic background. Many factors are closely related to the barrier function of the mucosa, and studies on their roles in HIV-1 invasion could promote the prevention and control of mucosal transmission of HIV-1.;https://www.wjgnet.com/1009-3079/full/v28/i18/873.htm;0.1;0.1;0.1;10093079;;;;

The viral membrane is enriched in PIP2, suggesting that the virus assembles at PIP2-rich microdomains. We showed previously that in model membranes PIP2 can form nanoscopic clusters bridged by multivalent cations. Here, using purified proteins we quantitated the binding of HIV-1 Gag-related proteins to giant unilamellar vesicles containing either clustered or free PIP2. Myristoylated MA strongly preferred binding to clustered PIP2. By contrast, unmyristoylated HIV-1 MA, RSV MA, and a PH domain all preferred to interact with free PIP2. We also found that HIV-1 Gag multimerization promotes PIP2 clustering. Truncated Gag proteins comprising the MA, CA, and SP domains (MACASP) or the MA and CA domains (MACA) induced self-quenching of acyl chain-labeled fluorescent PIP2 in liposomes, implying clustering. However, HIV-1 MA itself did not induce PIP2 clustering. A CA inter-hexamer dimer interface mutation led to a loss of induced PIP2 clustering in MACA, indicating the importance of protein multimerization. Cryo-electron tomography of liposomes with bound MACA showed an amorphous protein layer on the membrane surface. Thus, it appears that while protein–protein interactions are required for PIP2 clustering, formation of a regular lattice is not. Protein-induced PIP2 clustering and multivalent cation-induced PIP2 clustering are additive. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence that HIV-1 Gag can selectively target pre-existing PIP2-enriched domains of the plasma membrane for viral assembly, and that Gag multimerization can further enrich PIP2 at assembly sites. These effects could explain the observed PIP2 enrichment in HIV-1.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022283620304733;8.8;8.7;9.1;00222836;S0022283620304733;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0022283620304733;;

HAND is characterized by a state of chronic oxidative stress and inflammation. Microglia are extremely sensitive to a plethora of stimuli, including viral proteins and cART. The current study aimed to assess the effects of cART-mediated oxidative stress on the induction of inflammatory responses in microglia. In the present study, we chose a combination of three commonly used antiretroviral drugs—tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir. We demonstrated that exposure of microglia to the chosen cART cocktail induced generation of reactive oxygen species, subsequently leading to lysosomal dysfunction and dysregulated autophagy, ultimately resulting in the activation of microglia. Intriguingly, the potent antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, reversed the damaging effects of cART. These in vitro findings were further corroborated in vivo wherein cART-treated HIV transgenic (Tg) rats demonstrated increased microglial activation, exaggerated lysosome impairment, and dysregulated autophagy in the prefrontal cortices compared with HIV Tg rats not exposed to cART. Similar to in vitro findings, the treatment of HIV Tg rats with N-acetylcysteine also mitigated the deleterious effects of cART. Taken together, our findings suggest that oxidative stress-mediated lysosomal dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of HAND in drug-treated HIV-infected individuals and that antioxidant-mediated mitigation of oxidative stress could thus be considered as an adjunctive therapeutic strategy for ameliorating/dampening some of the neurological complications of HAND.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fneur.2020.00840/full;4.0;3.3;3.1;;;;;

We found that Nef mediated p53 degradation is accomplished through ubiquitin proteasome pathway in an Mdm2-independent manner. By GST pulldown and immunoprecipitation assays, we have shown that Nef interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP in both Nef transfected HEK-293T cells and HIV-1 infected MOLT3 cells. The p53 ubiquitination and degradation was found to be enhanced by Nef with E6AP but not by Nef with E6AP-C843A, a dominant negative E6AP mutant. We show that Nef binds with E6AP and promotes E6AP dependent p53 ubiquitination. Further, Nef inhibits apoptosis of p53 null H1299 cells after exogenous expression of p53 protein. The p53 dependent apoptosis of H1299 cells was further reduced after the expression of Nef with E6AP. However, Nef mediated reduction in p53 induced apoptosis of H1299 cells was restored when Nef was co-expressed with E6AP-C843A. Thus, Nef and E6AP co-operate to promote p53 ubiquitination and degradation in order to suppress p53 dependent apoptosis. CHME3 cells, which are a natural host of HIV-1, also show p53 ubiquitination and degradation by Nef and E6AP. These results establish that Nef induces p53 degradation via cellular E3 ligase E6AP to inhibit apoptosis during HIV-1 infection.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006291X20311256;4.4;4.2;4.6;0006291X;S0006291X20311256;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006291X20311256;;

This change in co-receptor preference makes the virus able to infect T cells. HIV-2 is known to infect MDMs and T cells and is dual tropic. The aim of this study was to elucidate the differential expression profiles of host miRNAs and their role in cells infected with HIV-1/HIV-2. To achieve this goal, a comparative global miRNA expression profile was determined in human PBMCs and MDMs infected with HIV-1/HIV-2. Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in HIV-1/HIV-2 infected PBMCs and MDMs using the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique. A comparative global miRNA expression profile in infected MDMs and PBMCs with HIV-1 and HIV-2 identified differential expression of several host miRNAs. These differentially expressed miRNAs are likely to be involved in many signaling pathways, like the p53 signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, MAPK signaling pathways, FoxO signaling pathway, and viral carcinogenesis. Thus, a comparative study of the differential expression of host miRNAs in MDMs and T cell in response to HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection will help us to identify unique biomarkers that can differentiate HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection.;https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/18/6970;5.1;5.2;5.3;16616596;;;;

Methods: Since June 2017, MSM participating in an ongoing cohort study in Kenya were offered daily PrEP, assessed for PrEP uptake and adherence, and evaluated for HIV-1 acquisition monthly. We determined tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentrations in dried blood spots 6–12 months after PrEP initiation, and tenofovir (TFV) concentrations and genotypic drug resistance in plasma samples when HIV-1 infection occurred. We assessed HIV-1 incidence by reported PrEP use. Findings: Of 172 MSM, 170 (98·8%) were eligible for PrEP, 140 (82·4%) started it, and 64 (57·7%) reported PrEP use at end of study. Of nine MSM who acquired HIV-1 [incidence rate: 3·9 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2·0–7·4) per 100 person-years (PY)], five reported PrEP use at the time of HIV-1 acquisition [incidence rate: 3·6 (95% CI, 1·5–8·6) per 100 PY)] and four had stopped or had never started PrEP [incidence rate: 4·3 (95% CI, 1·6–11·3) per 100 PY]. Among 76 MSM who reported PrEP use, 11 (14·5%) had protective TFV-DP concentrations of 700 fmol/punch (4 tablets a week). Among the five MSM who acquired HIV-1 while reporting PrEP use, only one had detectable but low TFV concentrations in plasma and none had genotypic HIV-1 resistance. Interpretation: HIV-1 incidence among MSM with access to programmatic PrEP was high and did not differ by reported PrEP use. Only one in seven MSM taking PrEP had protective tenofovir concentrations and four out of five MSM who acquired HIV-1 while reporting PrEP use had not taken it. Strengthened PrEP adherence support is required among MSM in Kenya.

This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 licenseBackground: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up in sub-Saharan Africa combined with weak routine virological monitoring has driven increasing HIV drug resistance. We investigated ART failure, drug resistance, and early mortality among patients with HIV admitted to hospital in Malawi. Methods: This observational cohort study was nested within the rapid urine-based screening for tuberculosis to reduce AIDS-related mortality in hospitalised patients in Africa (STAMP) trial, which recruited unselected (ie, irrespective of clinical presentation) adult (aged 18 years) patients with HIV-1 at admission to medical wards. Patients were included in our observational cohort study if they were enrolled at the Malawi site (Zomba Central Hospital) and were taking ART for at least 6 months at admission. Patients who met inclusion criteria had frozen plasma samples tested for HIV-1 viral load. Those with HIV-1 RNA of at least 1000 copies per mL had drug resistance testing by ultra-deep sequencing, with drug resistance defined as intermediate or high-level resistance using the Stanford HIVDR program. Mortality risk was calculated 56 days from enrolment. Patients were censored at death, at 56 days, or at last contact if lost to follow-up. The modelling strategy addressed the causal association between HIV multidrug resistance and mortality, excluding factors on the causal pathway (most notably, CD4 cell count, clinical signs of advanced HIV, and poor functional and nutritional status). Findings: Of 1316 patients with HIV enrolled in the STAMP trial at the Malawi site between Oct 26, 2015, and Sept 19, 2017, 786 had taken ART for at least 6 months. 252 (32%) of 786 patients had virological failure (viral load 1000 copies per mL). Mean age was 41·5 years (SD 11·4) and 528 (67%) of 786 were women. Of 237 patients with HIV drug resistance results available, 195 (82%) had resistance to lamivudine, 128 (54%) to tenofovir, and 219 (92%) to efavirenz. Resistance to at least two drugs was common (196, 83%), and this was associated with increased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1·7, 95% CI 1·2–2·4; p=0·0042). Interpretation: Interventions are urgently needed and should target ART clinic, hospital, and post-hospital care, including differentiated care focusing on patients with advanced HIV, rapid viral load testing, and routine access to drug resistance testing. Prompt diagnosis and switching to alternative ART could reduce early mortality among inpatients with HIV.

Hypoxic environment and CD73 overexpression are associated with altered metabolism, elevated cancer cell proliferation, and tumor vascularization. Herein, a delivery system was developed for silencing CD73 and HIF-1 gene using siRNA-loaded Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPION) nanocarriers for cancer treatment. SPIONs were encapsulated with thiolated chitosan (TC) and trimethyl chitosan (TMC) for improving their stabilization and functionalization. The nanoparticles (NPs) were about 133 nm in size, spherical, and non-toxic, and the addition of TAT peptide (derived from HIV-1 TAT protein) to TMC-TC-SPIONs significantly increased their cellular uptake by cancer cells. The produced NPs could efficiently accumulate in the tumor site, indicating their stability and targeting ability in reaching the tumor region. TAT-conjugated TMC-TC-SPIONs containing siRNAs could significantly reduce the HIF-1 and CD73 expression levels in cancer cells. Following transfection, cancer cells showed a significant reduction in migration and proliferation. Moreover, siRNA-loaded NPs could effectively reduce tumor growth and angiogenesis, as investigated by the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. This study suggested that TAT-TMC-TC-SPIONs can be potential nanocarrier for gene transfection in cancer therapy. Moreover, the co-silencing of CD73 and HIF-1 can be assumed as a novel anti-cancer treatment strategy with high tumor suppression potential.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014299920303277;5.7;5.9;5.5;00142999;S0014299920303277;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0014299920303277;;

Understanding risk factors that lead to mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV are critical. We evaluated maternal and infant plasma binding and neutralizing antibody responses in a drug-naïve, CRF01_AE infected MTCT cohort from Thailand to determine associations with transmission risk. Env V3-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody responses were significantly higher in HIV- infants, as compared to HIV+ infants. In fact, infant plasma neutralizing antibodies significantly associated with non-transmission. Conversely, increased maternal Env V3-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody responses were significantly associated with increased transmission risk, after controlling for maternal viral load. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating both maternal and infant humoral immune responses to better understand mechanisms of protection, as selective placental antibody transport may have a role in MTCT.

However, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)/HIV-1 coinfection has been described in only few cases worldwide and no data are available on immunological outcomes in HIV-1-patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Hence, this study aims to compare type I IFN response and T cell activation levels between a SARS-CoV-2/HIV-1-coinfected female patient and age-matched HIV-1-positive or uninfected women. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 52-year-old woman diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2/HIV-1 coinfection, ten HIV-1-positive women and five age-matched-healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. DIAGNOSES: SARS-CoV-2 infection caused severe pneumonia in the second week of illness in HIV-1-positive patient under protease inhibitors. Chest high-resolution computed tomography images of the SARS-CoV-2/HIV-1-coinfected patient showed bilateral ground-glass opacities. INTERVENTIONS: SARS-CoV-2/HIV-1-coinfected female patient under darunavir/cobicistat regimen received a 7-days hydroxychloroquine therapy. Analysis of IFN/ mRNA levels and CD4 and CD8 T cell (CD38, human leukocyte antigen-DR [HLA-DR], CD38 HLA-DR) frequencies were performed by RT/real-time PCR assays and flow cytometry, respectively. Median relative difference (MRD) was calculated for each immunological variable. For values greater than reference, MRD should be a positive number and for values that are smaller, MRD should be negative. OUTCOMES: The severe pneumonia observed in SARS-CoV-2/HIV-1-positive patient under protease inhibitors was reversed by a 7-days hydroxychloroquine therapy. At the end of treatment, on day 7, patient reported resolution of fever, normalization of respiratory rate (14 breaths/min), and improved oxygen arterial pressure with a FiO2 of 30%. MRD values for IFN/ and CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing CD38 and/or HLA-DR found in SARS-CoV-2-/HIV-1-coinfected woman were approximatively equal to 0 when refereed respectively to HIV-1-positive female patients [MRDs IFN/: median -0.2545 (range: -0.5/0.1); T cells: median -0.11 (range: -0.8/1.3)] and  6 when referred to healthy individuals [MRDs IFN/: median 28.45 (range: 15/41.9); T cells: median 10 (range 6/22)]. LESSONS: These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection in HIV-1-positive female patient was associated with increased levels of IFN/-mRNAs and T cell activation compared to healthy individuals.";https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/MD.0000000000021803;2.1;2.7;2.7;;;;;

The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system has successfully been demonstrated to excise or inactivate integrated HIV-1 provirus from infected cells by targeting the long terminal repeat (LTR) region. However, the guide RNAs (gRNAs) have classically avoided transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) that are readily observed and known to be important in human promoters. Although conventionally thought unfavorable due to potential impact on human promoters, our computational pipeline identified gRNA sequences that were predicted to inactivate HIV-1 transcription by targeting the nuclear factor B (NF-B) binding sites (gNFKB0, gNFKB1) with a high safety profile (lack of predicted or observed human edits) and broad-spectrum activity (predicted coverage of known viral sequences). Genome-wide, unbiased identification of double strand breaks (DSBs) enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-seq) showed that the gRNAs targeting NF-B binding sites had no detectable CRISPR-induced off-target edits in HeLa cells. 5 LTR-driven HIV-1 transcription was significantly reduced in three HIV-1 reporter cell lines. These results demonstrate a working model to specifically target well-known TFBSs in the HIV-1 LTR that are readily observed in human promoters to reduce HIV-1 transcription with a high-level safety profile and broad-spectrum activity.© 2020CRISPR has demonstrated potential for treating HIV latency.

Binding antibody responses were robust and comparable between arms, while antibody-dependent neutrophil and monocyte phagocytotic responses were greatly enhanced by ALFA. Per-exposure vaccine efficacy against heterologous tier 2 SHIV mucosal challenge was 90% in ALFA-adjuvanted males (P = 0.002), while alum conferred no protection. Half of the ALFA-adjuvanted males remained uninfected after the full challenge series, which spanned seven months after the last vaccination. Antibody-dependent monocyte and neutrophil phagocytic responses both strongly correlated with protection. Significant sex differences in infection risk were observed, with much lower infection rates in females than males. In humans, MPLA-liposome-alum adjuvanted gp120 also increased HIV-1-specific phagocytic responses relative to alum. Thus, next-generation liposome-based adjuvants can drive vaccine elicited antibody effector activity towards potent phagocytic responses in both macaques and humans and these responses correlate with protection. Future protein vaccination strategies aiming to improve functional humoral responses may benefit from such adjuvants.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008764;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

The HIV-1 subtype B epidemic comprehends a pandemic variant (named BPANDEMIC) disseminated worldwide and non-pandemic variants (named BCAR) that are mostly restricted to the Caribbean. The goal of this work was the identification of amino acid signatures (AAs) characteristic to the BCAR and BPANDEMIC variants. To this end, we analyzed HIV-1 subtype B full-length (n = 486) and partial (n = 814) genomic sequences from the Americas classified within the BCAR and BPANDEMIC clades and reconstructed the sequences of their most recent common ancestors (MRCA). Analysis of contemporary HIV-1 sequences revealed 13 AAs between BCAR and BPANDEMIC variants (four on Gag, three on Pol, three on Rev, and one in Vif, Vpu, and Tat) of which only two (one on Gag and one on Pol) were traced to the MRCA. All AAs correspond to polymorphic sites located outside essential functional proteins domains, except the AAs in Tat. The absence of stringent AAs inherited from their ancestors between modern BCAR and BPANDEMIC variants support that ecological factors, rather than viral determinants, were the main driving force behind the successful spread of the BPANDEMIC strain.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238995;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

Viral persistence could result from a variety of contributing factors including, but not limited to, non-adherence to treatment and adverse drug reactions, latently infected cells carrying replication-competent virus, drug–drug interactions, and inadequate antiretroviral drug (ARV) concentrations reached in several anatomic sites such as the brain, testis, and gut-associated lymphoid tissues. The distribution of ARVs at specific sites of infection is primarily dependent on drug physicochemical properties and drug plasma protein binding, as well as drug efflux, influx, and metabolic processes. A thorough understanding of the functional roles of drug transporters and metabolic enzymes in the disposition of ARVs in immune cell types and tissues that are characterized as HIV reservoirs and sanctuaries is critical to overcome the challenge of suboptimal drug distribution at sites of persistent HIV infection. This review summarizes the current knowledge related to the expression and function of drug transporters and metabolic enzymes in HIV cellular and anatomic reservoirs, and their potential contribution to drug–drug interactions and insufficient drug concentration at these sites.;http://link.springer.com/10.1208/s12248-020-00498-1;6.1;7.0;6.8;;;;;

On the one hand, HIV-1 utilizes dependency factors to support and sustain infection and complete the viral life cycle. On the other hand, both inducible and constitutively expressed host factors mediate efficient and functionally diverse antiviral processes that counteract an infection. To shed light into the complex interplay between HIV-1 and cellular proteins, we previously performed a targeted siRNA screen to identify and characterize novel regulators of viral replication and identified Cullin 3 (Cul3) as a previously undescribed factor that negatively regulates HIV-1 replication. Cul3 is a component of E3-ubiquitin ligase complexes that target substrates for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. In the present study, we show that Cul3 is expressed in HIV-1 target cells, such as CD4+ T cells, monocytes, and macrophages and depletion of Cul3 using siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 increases HIV-1 infection in immortalized cells and primary CD4+ T cells. Conversely, overexpression of Cul3 reduces HIV-1 infection in single replication cycle assays. Importantly, the antiviral effect of Cul3 was mapped to the transcriptional stage of the viral life cycle, an effect which is independent of its role in regulating the G1/S cell cycle transition. Using isogenic viruses that only differ in their promotor region, we find that the NF-B/NFAT transcription factor binding sites in the LTR are essential for Cul3-dependent regulation of viral gene expression. Although Cul3 effectively suppresses viral gene expression, HIV-1 does not appear to antagonize the antiviral function of Cul3 by targeting it for degradation. Taken together, these results indicate that Cul3 is a negative regulator of HIV-1 transcription which governs productive viral replication in infected cells.;https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/9/9/2010;0;0;0;;;;;

These interactions mediate both the traffic of inflammatory cells and virus-associated immune responses. In the context of viral infections, the human C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) receives great attention from the scientific community due to its role as an HIV-1 co-receptor. The genetic variant CCR532 (32 base-pair deletion in CCR5 gene) impairs CCR5 expression on the cell surface and is associated with protection against HIV infection in homozygous individuals. Also, the genetic variant CCR532 modifies the CCR5-mediated inflammatory responses in various conditions, such as inflammatory and infectious diseases. CCR5 antagonists mimic, at least in part, the natural effects of the CCR532 in humans, which explains the growing interest in the potential benefits of using CCR5 modulators for the treatment of different diseases. Nevertheless, beyond HIV infection, understanding the effects of the CCR532 variant in multiple viral infections is essential to shed light on the potential effects of the CCR5 modulators from a broader perspective. In this context, this review discusses the involvement of CCR5 and the effects of the CCR532 in human infections caused by the following pathogens: West Nile virus, Influenza virus, Human papillomavirus, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, Poliovirus, Dengue virus, Human cytomegalovirus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Enterovirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Hantavirus. Subsequently, this review addresses the impacts of CCR5 gene editing and CCR5 modulation on health and viral diseases. Also, this article connects recent findings regarding extracellular vesicles (e.g., exosomes), viruses, and CCR5. Neglected and emerging topics in “CCR5 research” are briefly described, with focus on Rocio virus, Zika virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Rhinovirus. Finally, the potential influence of CCR5 on the immune responses to coronaviruses is discussed.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168170220302938;5.1;4.9;5.3;01681702;S0168170220302938;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0168170220302938;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.After decades of its epidemic, the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is still rampant worldwide. An effective vaccine is considered to be the ultimate strategy to control and prevent the spread of HIV-1. To date, hundreds of clinical trials for HIV-1 vaccines have been tested. However, there is no HIV-1 vaccine available yet, mostly because the immune correlates of protection against HIV-1 infection are not fully understood. Currently, a variety of recombinant viruses-vectored HIV-1 vaccine candidates are extensively studied as promising strategies to elicit the appropriate immune response to control HIV-1 infection. In this review, we summarize the current findings on the immunological parameters to predict the protective efficacy of HIV-1 vaccines, and highlight the latest advances on HIV-1 vaccines based on viral vectors.;https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/8/3/511;6.5;7.5;4.5;;;;;

This trial assessed if patients with sustained low-level HIV-1 viremia on first-line ART benefit from a switch to second-line treatment. Methods and findings This multicenter, parallel-group, open-label, superiority, randomized controlled trial enrolled patients on first-line ART containing non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) with two consecutive VLs 100 copies/mL, with the second VL between 100-999 copies/mL, from eight clinics in Lesotho. Consenting participants were randomly assigned (1:1), stratified by facility, demographic group, and baseline VL, to either switch to second-line ART (switch group) or continued first-line ART (control group; WHO guidelines). The primary endpoint was viral suppression (<50 copies/mL) at 36 weeks. Analyses were by intention to treat, using logistic regression models, adjusted for demographic group and baseline VL. Between August 1, 2017, and August 7, 2019, 137 individuals were screened, of whom 80 were eligible and randomly assigned to switch (n = 40) or control group (n = 40). The majority of participants were female (54 [68%]) with a median age of 42 y (interquartile range [IQR] 35-51), taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine/efavirenz (49 [61%]) and on ART for a median of 5.9 y (IQR 3.3-8.6). At 36 weeks, 22/40 (55%) participants in the switch versus 10/40 (25%) in the control group achieved viral suppression (adjusted difference 29%, 95% CI 8%-50%, p = 0.009). The switch group had significantly higher probability of viral suppression across different VL thresholds (<20, <100, <200, <400, and <600 copies/mL) but not for <1,000 copies/mL. Thirty-four (85%) participants in switch group and 21 (53%) in control group experienced at least one adverse event (AE) (p = 0.002). No hospitalization or death or other serious adverse events were observed. Study limitations include a follow-up period too short to observe differences in clinical outcomes, missing values in CD4 cell counts due to national stockout of reagents during the study, and limited generalizability of findings to other than NNRTI-based first-line ART regimens. Conclusions In this study, switching to second-line ART among patients with sustained low-level HIV-1 viremia resulted in a higher proportion of participants with viral suppression. These results endorse lowering the threshold for virologic failure in future WHO guidelines.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003325;14.1;15.5;15.5;15491277;;;;

We propose to identify HIV-1-suppressing agents that can inhibit HIV-1 reactivation and reduce HIV-1-induced immune activation. Using a newly developed dual-reporter system and a high-throughput drug screen, we identified FDAapproved drugs that can suppress HIV-1 reactivation in both cell line models and CD4+ T cells from virally suppressed HIV-1- infected individuals. We identified 11 cellular pathways required for HIV-1 reactivation as druggable targets. Using differential expression analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, and exon-intron landscape analysis, we examined the impact of drug treatment on the cellular environment at a genome-wide level. We identified what we believe to be a new function of a JAK inhibitor, filgotinib, that suppresses HIV-1 splicing. First, filgotinib preferentially suppresses spliced HIV-1 RNA transcription. Second, filgotinib suppresses HIV-1-driven aberrant cancer-related gene expression at the integration site. Third, we found that filgotinib suppresses HIV-1 transcription by inhibiting T cell activation and by modulating RNA splicing. Finally, we found that filgotinib treatment reduces the proliferation of HIV-1-infected cells. Overall, the combination of a drug screen and transcriptome analysis provides systematic understanding of cellular targets required for HIV-1 reactivation and drug candidates that may reduce HIV-1-related immune activation.

However, the association between this mutation and HIV-1 infection among antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated HIV-1 seropositive patients is controversial. In Morocco, no data is available regarding this polymorphism. Objectives: In the present case-control study, we aimed to investigate the frequency of the CCR2-64I genetic polymorphism and to evaluate the association of this mutant allele with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and immunovirological outcomes in Morocco. Methods: We recruited 100 HIV-1 seropositive patients (cases) undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 200 HIV-1 seronegative individuals from Mohammed V Military Training Hospital in Rabat. Genotyping of the CCR2-64I polymorphism was performed using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay and automated DNA sequencing. The comparison between variables was performed using 2-test, Fisher's exact test, or Mann–Whitney U test, as appropriate. Factors associated with immunovirological outcomes were assessed using logistic regression analysis. Results: The frequencies of CCR2-64V/CCR2-64V, CCR2-64V/CCR2-64I and CCR2-64I/CCR2-64I genotypes were 67, 30 and 3%, respectively among HIV-1 infected patients (cases), compared to 73, 24.50, and 2.50%, respectively, among HIV-1 uninfected individuals (controls). We didn't observe any statistically significant difference in the genotype distribution between cases and control groups. Additionally, the multivariate logistic regression analysis didn't reveal a significant association between the CCR2-64I polymorphism and the immunovirological outcomes after one year of ART (p> 0.05). Conclusion: We are the first to report the frequency of CCR2-64I polymorphism and its association with HIV-1 infection in Moroccan individuals. Our findings suggest that the CCR2-64I allele may not influence the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, as was previously reported in other populations. Besides, we hypothesize that this mutation, independently of classical risk factors, may not impact the virological outcomes and immunological recovery among HIV-1 infected patients under treatment. Nevertheless, this result required confirmation by further large scale and extended follow-up studies, considering the low frequency of the CCR2-64I/CCR2-64I homozygous genotype in our population.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2452014420301291;0.3;0.5;0.7;24520144;S2452014420301291;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2452014420301291;;

Rapid tests (RTs) are considered key to HIV screening and management. Some studies have found RTs to be comparable with the ELISA test whilst others have reported lower sensitivity. Aim and study design: The aim of this retrospective, descriptive study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the HIV 1/2/O Tri-line rapid test (HIV-TRT) device compared with ELISA. Method: The study sample comprised 45 records of patients who tested for HIV using the HIV-TRT device and ELISA. Results: As compared with ELISA as the 100% gold standard, the sensitivity of the HIV-TRT was 80% (CI: 59%–93%) and specificity was 100% (CI: 83%–100%). ROC area of 0.9 at 95% CI was determined. Conclusion: The low sensitivity of HIV-TRT is a concern, since HIV screening in South Africa makes use of RTs.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/odi.13399;4.2;4.0;3.9;1354523X;;;;

We investigated the frequency and associations of suboptimal CD4 recovery after ART started during acute HIV infection (AHI). METHODS: Participants who started ART in Fiebig I to V AHI with 48 weeks of continuous documented HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL were stratified by CD4 count at latest study visit to suboptimal immune recovery (SIR; CD4 < 350 cells/mm3 ), intermediate immune recovery (IIR; 350  CD4 < 500) and complete immune recovery (CIR; CD4  500). Clinical and laboratory parameters were assessed at pre-ART baseline and latest study visit. Additional inflammatory and neurobehavioral endpoints were examined at baseline and 96 weeks. RESULTS: Of 304 participants (96% male, median 26 years old) evaluated after median 144 (range 60 to 420) weeks of ART initiated at median 19 days (range 1 to 62) post-exposure, 3.6% (n = 11) had SIR and 14.5% (n = 44) had IIR. Pre-ART CD4 count in SIR compared to CIR participants was 265 versus 411 cells/mm3 (p = 0.002). Individuals with SIR or IIR had a slower CD4 rate of recovery compared to those with CIR. Timing of ART initiation by Fiebig stage did not affect CD4 count during treatment. Following ART, the CD8+ T cell count (p = 0.001) and CD4/CD8 ratio (p = 0.047) were lower in SIR compared to CIR participants. Compared to the CIR group at week 96, the combined SIR and IIR groups had higher sCD14 (p = 0.008) and lower IL-6 (p = 0.04) in plasma, without differences in neuropsychological or psychiatric indices. CONCLUSIONS: Despite immediate and sustained treatment in AHI, suboptimal CD4 recovery occurs uncommonly and is associated with low pre-ART CD4 count as well as persistent low CD8 count and CD4/CD8 ratio during treatment.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jia2.25585;5.5;6.7;7.1;;;;;

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), the primary targets of HIV-1 vaccine design, have to negotiate this glycan shield. Here, we review the barriers and opportunities that the HIV-1 glycan shield presents for vaccine induction of bNAbs. RECENT FINDINGS: Glycan shields can impact the nature of the antibody response and influence the development of neutralization breadth in HIV-1 infections. The architecture of the glycan shield arising from glycan interactions and dynamics have been modeled, and its fine structure, that is, the site-wise glycan heterogeneity, has been determined for some isolates. Although the extent of glycan shielding is conserved, the precise number, location and processing of glycans, however, is strain-dependent. New insights continue to reveal how such differences can impact bNAb activity and development. Novel approaches have exploited the glycan shield for designing immunogens that bind the germline precursors of bNAbs, a critical roadblock for vaccine-induction of bNAbs. SUMMARY: The HIV-1 glycan shield can significantly impact the induction and maturation of bNAbs, and a better understanding of how to manipulate it will improve immunogen design.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/COH.0000000000000639;7.5;7.2;7.8;;;;;

Here, we investigate the potential of nanoengineered CD4+ T cell membrane-coated nanoparticles (TNP) to neutralize a broad range of HIV-1 strains. TNP displayed outstanding neutralizing breadth and potency; they neutralized all 125 HIV-1-pseudotyped viruses tested, including global subtypes/recombinant forms, and transmitted/founder viruses, with a geometric mean 80% inhibitory concentration (IC80) of 819 g ml-1 (range, 72 to 8,570 g ml-1). TNP also selectively bound to and induced autophagy in HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells and macrophages, while having no effect on uninfected cells. This TNP-mediated autophagy inhibited viral release and reduced cell-associated HIV-1 in a dose-and phospholipase D1-dependent manner. Genetic or pharmacolog-ical inhibition of autophagy ablated this effect. Thus, we can use TNP as therapeutic agents to neutralize cell-free HIV-1 and to target HIV-1 gp120-expressing cells to decrease the HIV-1 reservoir. IMPORTANCE HIV-1 is a major global health challenge. The development of an effective vaccine and/or a therapeutic cure is a top priority. The creation of vaccines that focus an antibody response toward a particular epitope of a protein has shown promise, but the genetic diversity of HIV-1 hinders this progress. Here we developed an approach using nanoengineered CD4+ T cell membrane-coated nanoparticles (TNP). Not only do TNP effectively neutralize all strains of HIV-1, but they also selectively bind to infected cells and decrease the release of HIV-1 particles through an autophagy-dependent mechanism with no drug-induced off-target or cytotoxic effects on bystander cells.";https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/5/e00903-20;11.2;10.5;9.9;21612129;;;;

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and other lentiviruses mediate the infection of non-dividing cells through the ability of the capsid protein1 to engage the cellular nuclear import pathways of the target cell and mediate their nuclear translocation through components of the nuclear pore complex2–4. Although recent studies have observed the presence of the capsid protein in the nucleus during infection5–8, reverse transcription and disassembly of the viral core have conventionally been considered to be cytoplasmic events. Here, we use an inducible nuclear pore complex blockade to monitor the kinetics of HIV-1 nuclear import and define the biochemical staging of these steps of infection. Surprisingly, we observe that nuclear import occurs with relatively rapid kinetics (<5 h) and precedes the completion of reverse transcription in target cells, demonstrating that reverse transcription is completed in the nucleus. We also observe that HIV-1 remains susceptible to the capsid-destabilizing compound PF74 following nuclear import, revealing that uncoating is completed in the nucleus. Additionally, we observe that certain capsid mutants are insensitive to a Nup62-mediated nuclear pore complex blockade in cells that potently block infection by wild-type capsid, demonstrating that HIV-1 can use distinct nuclear import pathways during infection. These studies collectively define the spatio-temporal staging of critical steps of HIV-1 infection and provide an experimental system to separate and thereby define the cytoplasmic and nuclear stages of infection by other viruses.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0735-8;9.3;16.5;23.2;;;;;

Mathematical model of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection with contact rate represented by Crowley-Martin function response is taken into account. The aims of this novel study is to checkthe local and global stability of the disease and also prevent the outbreak from the community. Methods: The mathematical model as well as optimal system of nonlinear differential equations are tackled numerically by Runge-Kutta fourth-order method. For global stability we use Lyapunov-LaSalle invariance principle and for the description of optimal control, Pontryagin's maximum principle is used. Results: Graphical results are depicted and examined with different parameters values versus the basic reproductive number R0 and also the plots with and without control. The density of infected cells continued to increase without treatment, but the concentration of these cells decreased after treatment. The intensity of the pathogenic virus before and after the optimal treatment. This indicates a sharp drop in the rate of pathogenic viruses after treatment. It prevents the production of viruses by preventing cell infection and minimizing side effects. Conclusions: We analysed the model by defining the basic reproductive number, showing the boundedness, positivity and permanence of the solution, and proving the local and global stability of the infection-free state. We show that the threshold quantity R0 < 1, the elimination of HIV-1 infection from the T cell population, is eradicated; while for the threshold quantity R0 > 1, HIV-1 infection remains in the host. When the threshold quantity R0 > 1, then it shows that the steady-state of chronic disease is globally stable. Optimal control strategies are developed with the optimal control pair for the description of optimal control. To reduce the density of infected cells and viruses as well as maximize the density of healthy cells is determined by the objective functional.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169260720305691;5.7;5.4;7.5;01692607;S0169260720305691;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0169260720305691;;

Integrase strand transfer inhibitors are potent inhibitors of the HIV integrase enzyme with IC90/95 values in the low nanogram per milliliter range and they retain antiviral activity against strains of HIV with acquired resistance to other classes of antiretrovirals. Each of the integrase strand transfer inhibitors have unique pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties, influencing their role in clinical use in specific subsets of patients. Cabotegravir, approved for use in Canada but not yet by the US Food and Drug Administration, is formulated in both oral and intramuscular formulations; the latter of which has shown efficacy as a long-acting extended-release formulation. Cabotegravir, raltegravir, and dolutegravir have minimal drug–drug interaction profiles, as their metabolism has minimal cytochrome P450 involvement. Conversely, elvitegravir metabolism occurs primarily via cytochrome P450 3A4 and requires pharmacokinetic boosting to achieve systemic exposures amenable to once-daily dosing. Bictegravir metabolism has similar contributions from both cytochrome P450 3A4 and uridine 5-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. Bictegravir, dolutegravir, and raltegravir are recommended components of initial regimens for most people with HIV in the US adult and adolescent HIV treatment guidelines. This review summarizes and compares the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the integrase strand transfer inhibitor agents, and describes specific pharmacokinetic considerations for persons with hepatic impairment, renal dysfunction, pregnancy, and co-infections.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40262-020-00898-8;8.5;8.2;8.8;03125963;;;;

It can easily cause organ damage in individuals who are immunocompromised. While many studies have examined the virology and immunology of simple CMV infection, few articles have described the unique immunological features of patients with HIV-CMV coinfection. Methods: CMV infection was detected in 808 HIV/AIDS inpatients in our center from January 2017 to October 2019, and the relevant data from these patients were retrospectively analyzed. HIV-RNA, CD4+ T lymphocyte count, CMV-DNA, and related antibodies were measured in all patients. The positive rates of CMV-DNA in blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were compared. The positive rates between anti-CMV-immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody and CMV-DNA in blood were compared. The correlation between immune status and CMV positive rate was analyzed based on the CD4+ T lymphocyte count. Results: The overall positive rate of CMV infection in HIV/AIDS patients was 29.05%. The positive rate of CMV-DNA in urine, blood, and CSF samples was 25.27%, 26.01%, and 5.70%, respectively, and showed no significant difference between urine and blood. However, plasma CMV-IgM antibody level was significantly different between the urine and blood. The absolute CD4+ T lymphocyte count and the HIV-RNA level were significantly different between the CMV-infected group and the non-CMV infected group. Conclusions: Low CD4+ T lymphocyte count and high HIV-1 viral load are risk factors for CMV infection in HIV/AIDS patients. Detection of urine or plasma CMV-DNA by using real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is highly valuable in screening CMV infection in HIV/AIDS patients, while detection of blood CMV IgG and CMV IgM levels has limited clinical value.;http://apm.amegroups.com/article/view/49423/html;2.1;2.4;2.2;22245820;;;;

While significant progress has been made in understanding how the HIV reservoir is established, transcription repression mechanisms that are enforced on the integrated viral promoter have not been fully revealed. In this study, we performed a whole-genome CRISPR knockout screen in HIV infected T cells to identify host genes that potentially promote HIV latency. Of several top candidates, the KRAB-containing zinc finger protein, ZNF304, was identified as the top hit. ZNF304 silences HIV gene transcription through associating with TRIM28 and recruiting to the viral promoter heterochromatin-inducing methyltransferases, including the polycomb repression complex (PRC) and SETB1. Depletion of ZNF304 expression reduced levels of H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub repressive histone marks on the HIV promoter as well as SETB1 and TRIM28, ultimately enhancing HIV gene transcription. Significantly, ZNF304 also promoted HIV latency, as its depletion delayed the entry of HIV infected cells into latency. In primary CD4+ cells, ectopic expression of ZNF304 silenced viral transcription. We conclude that by associating with TRIM28 and recruiting host transcriptional repressive complexes, SETB1 and PRC, to the HIV promoter, ZNF304 silences HIV gene transcription and promotes viral latency.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008834;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

The innate immune systems of these immensely abundant, an-ciently diverged mammals remain insufficiently characterized. While bat genomes contain many endogenous retroviral elements indicative of past exogenous infec-tions, little is known about restrictions to extant retroviruses. Here, we describe a major postentry restriction in cells of the yinpterochiropteran bat Pteropus alecto. Primate lentiviruses (HIV-1, SIVmac) were potently blocked at early life cycle steps, with up to 1,000-fold decreases in infectivity. The block was specific, because nonprimate lentiviruses such as equine infectious anemia virus and feline immuno-deficiency virus were unimpaired, as were foamy retroviruses. Interspecies hetero-karyons demonstrated a dominant block consistent with restriction of incoming vi-ruses. Several features suggested potential TRIM5 (tripartite motif 5) or myxovirus resistance protein 2 (MX2) protein restriction, including postentry action, cyclospor-ine sensitivity, and reversal by capsid cyclophilin A (CypA) binding loop mutations. Viral nuclear import was significantly reduced, and this deficit was substantially res-cued by cyclosporine treatment. However, saturation with HIV-1 virus-like particles did not relieve the restriction at all. P. alecto TRIM5 was inactive against HIV-1 al-though it blocked the gammaretrovirus N-tropic murine leukemia virus. Despite major divergence in a critical N-terminal motif required for human MX2 activity, P. alecto MX2 had anti-HIV activity. However, this did not quantitatively account for the restriction and was independent of and synergistic with an additional CypA-dependent restriction. These results reveal a novel, specific restriction to primate lentiviruses in the Pteropodidae and advance understanding of bat innate immunity. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic suggests that bat innate immune systems are insufficiently characterized relative to the medical importance of these animals. Retroviruses, e.g., HIV-1, can be severe pathogens when they cross species barriers, and bat restrictions corresponding to retroviruses are comparatively unstudied. Here, we compared the abilities of retroviruses from three genera (Lentivirus, Gammaretro-virus, and Spumavirus) to infect cells of the large fruit-eating bat P. alecto and other mammals. We identified a major, specific postentry restriction to primate lentivi-ruses. HIV-1 and SIVmac are potently blocked at early life cycle steps, but nonpri-mate lentiviruses and foamy retroviruses are entirely unrestricted. Despite acting postentry and in a CypA-dependent manner with features reminiscent of antiretrovi-ral factors from other mammals, this restriction was not saturable with virus-like particles and was independent of P. alecto TRIM5, TRIM21, TRIM22, TRIM34, and MX2. These results identify a novel restriction and highlight cyclophilin-capsid interactions as ancient species-specific determinants of retroviral infection.;https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/5/e01854-20;11.2;10.5;9.9;21612129;;;;

High-resolution structures of the curved assembly, or in complex with host factors, have not been available. By devising cryo-EM methodologies for exceedingly flexible and pleomorphic assemblies, we have determined cryo-EM structures of apo-CA hexamers and in complex with cyclophilin A (CypA) at near-atomic resolutions. The CA hexamers are intrinsically curved, flexible and asymmetric, revealing the capsomere and not the previously touted dimer or trimer interfaces as the key contributor to capsid curvature. CypA recognizes specific geometries of the curved lattice, simultaneously interacting with three CA protomers from adjacent hexamers via two noncanonical interfaces, thus stabilizing the capsid. By determining multiple structures from various helical symmetries, we further revealed the essential plasticity of the CA molecule, which allows formation of continuously curved conical capsids and the mechanism of capsid pattern sensing by CypA.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-020-0467-8;20.9;20.5;19.1;15459993;;;;

This study aimed at identifying and examining lymphocyte associated sex differences in HIV-1 pathogenesis using a data-driven approach. To select targets for investigating sex differences in lymphocytes, data of microarray experiments and literature mining were integrated. Data from three large-scale microarray experiments were obtained from NCBI/GEO and screened for sex differences in gene expression. Literature mining was employed to identify sex biased genes in the microarray data, which were relevant to HIV-1 pathogenesis and lymphocyte biology. Sex differences in gene expression of selected genes were investigated by RT-qPCR and flowcytometry in healthy individuals and persons living with HIV-1. A significant and consistent sex bias was identified in 31 genes, the majority of which were related to immunity and expressed at higher levels in women. Using literature mining, three genes (DPP4, FCGR1A and SOCS3) were selected for analysis by qPCR because of their relevance to HIV, as well as, B and T cell biology. DPP4 exhibited the most significant sex bias in mRNA expression (p = 0.00029). Therefore, its expression was further analyzed on B and T cells using flowcytometry. In HIV-1 infected controllers and healthy individuals, frequencies of CD4+DPP4+ T cells were higher in women compared to men (p = 0.037 and p = 0.027). In women, CD4 T cell counts correlated with a predominant decreased in DPP4+CD4+ T cells (p = 0.0032). Sex differences in DPP4 expression abrogated in progressive HIV-1 infection. In conclusion, we found sex differences in the pathobiology of T cells in HIV-1 infection using a data-driven approach. Our results indicate that DPP4 expression on CD4+ T cells might contribute to the immunological sex differences observed in chronic HIV-1 infection.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239399;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

It can easily cause organ damage in individuals who are immunocompromised. While many studies have examined the virology and immunology of simple CMV infection, few articles have described the unique immunological features of patients with HIV-CMV coinfection. Methods: CMV infection was detected in 808 HIV/AIDS inpatients in our center from January 2017 to October 2019, and the relevant data from these patients were retrospectively analyzed. HIV-RNA, CD4+ T lymphocyte count, CMV-DNA, and related antibodies were measured in all patients. The positive rates of CMV-DNA in blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were compared. The positive rates between anti-CMV-immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody and CMV-DNA in blood were compared. The correlation between immune status and CMV positive rate was analyzed based on the CD4+ T lymphocyte count. Results: The overall positive rate of CMV infection in HIV/AIDS patients was 29.05%. The positive rate of CMV-DNA in urine, blood, and CSF samples was 25.27%, 26.01%, and 5.70%, respectively, and showed no significant difference between urine and blood. However, plasma CMV-IgM antibody level was significantly different between the urine and blood. The absolute CD4+ T lymphocyte count and the HIVRNA level were significantly different between the CMV-infected group and the non-CMV infected group. Conclusions: Low CD4+ T lymphocyte count and high HIV-1 viral load are risk factors for CMV infection in HIV/AIDS patients. Detection of urine or plasma CMV-DNA by using real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is highly valuable in screening CMV infection in HIV/AIDS patients, while detection of blood CMV IgG and CMV IgM levels has limited clinical value.;http://apm.amegroups.com/article/view/49423/html;0.8;2.1;3.8;2225319X;;;;

Few studies have examined recent trends in TDR prevalence using published genetic sequences and described the characteristics of ART-naïve persons from whom these published sequences have been obtained. Methods: We identified 125 studies published between 2014 and 2019 for which HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) with or without protease from 50 ART-naïve adult persons were submitted to the GenBank sequence database. The population characteristics and TDR prevalence were compared to those in 122 studies published in the preceding five years between 2009 and 2013. TDR prevalence was analysed using median study-level and person-level data. Results and discussion: The 2009 to 2013 and 2014 to 2019 studies reported sequence data from 32,866 and 41,724 ART-naïve persons respectively. Studies from the low- and middle-income country (LMIC) regions in sub-Saharan Africa, South/Southeast Asia and Latin America/Caribbean accounted for approximately two-thirds of the studies during each period. Between the two periods, the proportion of studies from sub-Saharan Africa and from South/Southeast Asia countries other than China decreased from 43% to 32% and the proportion of studies performed at sentinel sites for recent HIV-1 infection decreased from 33% to 22%. Between 2014 and 2019, median study-level TDR prevalence was 4.1% in South/Southeast Asia, 6.0% in sub-Saharan Africa, 9.1% in Latin America/Caribbean, 8.5% in Europe and 14.2% in North America. In the person-level analysis, there was an increase in overall, NNRTI and two-class NRTI/NNRTI resistance in sub-Saharan Africa; an increase in NNRTI resistance in Latin America/Caribbean, and an increase in overall, NNRTI and PI resistance in North America. Conclusions: Overall, NNRTI and dual NRTI/NNRTI-associated TDR prevalence was significantly higher in sub-Saharan Africa studies published between 2014 and 2019 compared with those published between 2009 and 2013. The decreasing proportion of studies from the hardest hit LMIC regions and the shift away from sentinel sites for recent infection suggests that global TDR surveillance efforts and publication of findings require renewed emphasis.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jia2.25611;5.5;6.7;7.1;;;;;

There are few data to support the long-term use of once-daily DRV in patients with DRV RAMs. This observational study evaluated 48-week clinical outcomes of 22 treatment-experienced patients with 1 DRV RAMs switched to once-daily DRV between 2014 and 2017. The primary endpoint was HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml at week 48. Safety parameters were analyzed throughout the study. The median age of the sample was 53 years, 18 (82%) had baseline HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml, and the median number of historical DRV RAMs was 2. At week 48, 20 (91%) had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml, and 2 (9%) had HIV-1 RNA of 82 and 59,637 copies/ml and reported non-adherence. No adverse drug reactions were observed through week 48. Once-daily DRV maintained virologic control in patients with 1 historical DRV RAMs and was safe and well-tolerated.

Material and method: NGS analyses were performed on forty-one plasma samples from HIV-1 affected patients using the Sentosa SQ HIV genotyping assay (Vela-Diagnostics, Germany). This system comprises a semi-automated Ion torrent based platform and the sequencing results were analyzed based on ANRS, REGA and Stanford drug resistance algorithms. Phylogenetic analysis was analyzed based on https://comet.lih.lu database as well as MEGA5 Software. Results: Drug resistances were identified in thirty-three samples (80%) out of forty-one samples. The Phylogenetic analysis results showed that CRF-35AD (94%) and subtypes B (2.4%) and G (2.4%) were dominant subtypes in this study. NRTI and NNRTI associated dominant mutations were M184I/V and K103 N.High-level resistance to lamivudine (3 TC) and Emtricitabine (FTC) were detected in 34.3% of patients while 53.1% were resistant to Efavirenz (EFV) and Nevirapine (NVP). The Protease inhibitor (PI) minor and major mutations were not reported but more than 95% of samples had polymorphisms mutation in K20R, M36I, H69K, L89 M positions. These mutations are subtype dependent and completely are absent in subtype B virus. The secondary mutations were reported in positions of E157Q, S230 N, and T97A of integrase gene and four samples represent low-level resistance to integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI). Conclusions: This is the first preliminary evaluation of HIV-1 drug resistance mutation (DRM) by using the Sentosa SQ HIV Genotyping Assay in Iran. The NGS represent a promising tool for the accurate detection of DRMs of CRF-35AD that is dominant subtype in Iranian HIV-1 infected population and for the first time revealed HIV-1 subtype G in Iranian population. In the present study polymorphic mutation in the position of K20R, M36I, H69K, L89 M were properly reported in CRF35AD that is dominant in Iranian HIV patients.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0882401020305088;2.4;3.1;4.4;08824010;S0882401020305088;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0882401020305088;;

All Rights Reserved.NF-B-interacting long noncoding RNA (NKILA) was recently identified as a negative regulator of NF-B signaling and plays an important role in the development of various cancers. It is well known that NF-B-mediated activation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven gene expression is required for HIV-1 transcription and reactivation of latency. However, whether NKILA plays essential roles in HIV-1 replication and latency is unclear. Here, by ectopic expression and silencing experiments, we demonstrate that NKILA potently inhibits HIV-1 replication in an NF-B-dependent manner by suppressing HIV-1 LTR promoter activity. Moreover, NKILA showed broad-spectrum inhibition on the replication of HIV-1 clones with different coreceptor tropisms as well as on LTR activity of various HIV-1 clinical subtypes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that NKILA expression abolishes the recruitment of p65 to the duplicated B binding sites in the HIV-1 LTR. NKILA mutants disrupting NF-B inhibition also lost the ability to inhibit HIV-1 replication. Notably, HIV-1 infection or reactivation significantly downregulated NKILA expression in T cells in order to facilitate viral replication. Downregulated NKILA was mainly due to reduced acetylation of histone K27 on the promoter of NKILA by HIV-1 infection, which blocks NKILA expression. Knockdown of NKILA promoted the reactivation of latent HIV-1 upon phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation, while ectopic NKILA suppressed the reactivation in a well-established clinical model of withdrawal of azidothymidine (AZT) in vitro. These findings improve our understanding of the functional suppression of HIV-1 replication and latency by NKILA through NF-B signaling. IMPORTANCE The NF-B pathway plays key roles in HIV-1 replication and reactivation of HIV-1 latency. A regulator inhibiting NF-B activation may be a promising therapeutic strategy against HIV-1. Recently, NF-B-interacting long noncoding RNA (NKILA) was identified to suppress the development of different human cancers by inhibiting IB kinase (IKK)-induced IB phosphorylation and NF-B pathway activation, whereas the relationship between NKILA and HIV-1 replication is still unknown. Here, our results show that NKILA inhibits HIV-1 replication and reactivation by suppressing HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven transcription initiation. Moreover, NKILA inhibited the replication of HIV-1 clones with different coreceptor tropisms. This project may reveal a target for the development of novel anti-HIV drugs.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/17/e01057-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

Study design: Virological success (VS) and virological rebound (VR) after therapy start were assessed by survival analyses. Drug-resistance was evaluated at baseline and at virological failure. Results: Among 798 patients analysed, 38.6 %, 27.1 % and 34.3 % received raltegravir, elvitegravir and dolutegravir, respectively. Baseline resistance to NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs and INIs was: 3.9 %, 13.9 %, 1.6 % and 0.5 %, respectively. Overall, by 12 months of treatment, the probability of VS was 95 %, while the probability of VR by 36 months after VS was 13.1 %. No significant differences in the virological response were found according to the INI used. The higher pre-therapy viremia strata was (<100,000 vs. 100,000-500,000 vs. > 500,000 copies/mL), lower was the probability of VS (96.0 % vs. 95.2 % vs. 91.1 %, respectively, P < 0.001), and higher the probability of VR (10.2 % vs. 15.8 % vs. 16.6 %, respectively, P = 0.010). CD4 cell count <200 cell/mm3 was associated with the lowest probability of VS (91.5 %, P < 0.001) and the highest probability of VR (20.7 %, P = 0.008) compared to higher CD4 levels. Multivariable Cox-regression confirmed the negative role of high pre-therapy viremia and low CD4 cell count on VS, but not on VR. Forty-three (5.3 %) patients experienced VF (raltegravir: 30; elvitegravir: 9; dolutegravir: 4). Patients failing dolutegravir did not harbor any resistance mutation either in integrase or reverse transcriptase.

Antibody-based molecules can be designed based on broadly neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies that target free virions and infected cells. These multispecific molecules, either by IgG-like or non-IgG-like in structure, aim to target several independent HIV-1 epitopes and/or engage effector cells to eliminate the replicating virus and infected cells. This detailed review is intended to stimulate discussion on future requirements for novel immunotherapeutic molecules. RECENT FINDINGS: Bispecific and trispecific antibodies are engineered as a single molecules to target two or more independent epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope (Env). These antibody-based molecules have increased avidity for Env, leading to improved neutralization potency and breadth compared with single parental antibodies. Furthermore, bispecific and trispecific antibodies that engage cellular receptors with one arm of the molecule help concentrate inhibitory molecules to the sites of potential infection and facilitate engagement of immune effector cells and Env-expressing target cells for their elimination. SUMMARY: Recently engineered antibody-based molecules of different sizes and structures show promise in vitro or in vivo and are encouraging candidates for HIV treatment.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/COH.0000000000000640;7.5;7.2;7.8;;;;;

Methods: We measured concentrations of procollagen type 1 pro-peptide (P1NP), carboxyl-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), D-dimer, interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), neopterin, and soluble CD14 and 163 at weeks 0, 12, and 48 in 123 SECOND-LINE dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) substudy participants. Linear regression was used to compare changes in biomarkers. Predictors of  5% BMD loss were examined using multivariable regression. Results: The mean age was 38 years, the mean CD4 T-cell count was 252 cells/µL and the mean viral load was 4.2 log HIV-1 RNA copies/mL; 56% of participants were female and 47% were randomized to receive a nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor [N(t)RTI]-based regimen [91% (53/58) were randomized to receive a tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-containing regimen]. Over 48 weeks, 71% in the N(t)RTI arm experienced  5% hip BMD loss vs. 29% in the raltegravir arm (P = 0.001). Week 12 changes in P1NP and CTX were significantly greater among patients experiencing  5% hip BMD loss, patients randomized to N(t)RTI, and male patients. Predictors of  5% hip BMD loss at week 48 were P1NP increase [odds ratio (OR) 5.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1–27; P < 0.043]; N(t)RTI randomization (OR 6.7; 95% CI 2.0–27.1; P < 0.003), being African, higher baseline CD4 T cell count, and smoking. Conclusions: In a diverse cohort of viraemic HIV-infected patients, switching to second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) was associated with clinically significant BMD loss, which was correlated with an early increase in P1NP. Measurement of P1NP may facilitate timely interventions to reduce rapid BMD loss among at-risk patients.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hiv.12882;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;;

Assays to monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth in vitro depend on time-consuming and costly RNA extraction steps, hampering progress in basic research and drug development efforts. Here, we developed a simplified quantitative real-time PCR assay that bypasses viral RNA extraction steps and can monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth from a small amount of cell culture supernatants. In addition, we show that this approach is easily adaptable to numerous other RNA and DNA viruses. Using this assay, we screened the activities of a number of compounds that were predicted to alter SARSCoV-2 entry and replication as well as HIV-1-specific drugs in a proof-of-concept study. We found that E64D (inhibitor of endosomal proteases cathepsin B and L) and apilimod (endosomal trafficking inhibitor) potently decreased the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cell culture supernatants with minimal cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, we found that the macropinocytosis inhibitor ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA) similarly decreased SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in supernatants, suggesting that entry may additionally be mediated by an alternative pathway. HIV-1-specific inhibitors nevirapine (a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]), amprenavir (a protease inhibitor), and allosteric integrase inhibitor 2 (ALLINI-2) modestly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, albeit the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were much higher than that required for HIV-1. Taking the data together, this simplified assay will expedite basic SARS-CoV-2 research, be amenable to mid-throughput screening assays (i.e., drug, CRISPR, small interfering RNA [siRNA], etc.), and be applicable to a broad number of RNA and DNA viruses. IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, is continuing to cause immense respiratory disease and social and economic disruptions. Conventional assays that monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture rely on costly and timeconsuming RNA extraction procedures, hampering progress in basic SARS-CoV-2 research and development of effective therapeutics. Here, we developed a simple quantitative real-time PCR assay to monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture supernatants that does not necessitate RNA extraction and that is as accurate and sensitive as existing methods. In a proof-of-concept screen, we found that E64D, apilimod, EIPA, and remdesivir can substantially impede SARS-Cov-2 replication, providing novel insight into viral entry and replication mechanisms. In addition, we show that this approach is easily adaptable to numerous other RNA and DNA viruses. This simplified assay will undoubtedly expedite basic SARS-CoV-2 and virology research and be amenable to use in drug screening platforms to identify therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.;https://msphere.asm.org/content/5/5/e00658-20;2.4;4.0;5.9;;;;;

These infections can cause cancer or result in long-term health problems. Due to high prevalence of STIs, a safe and effective vaccine is required to overcome these fatal viruses. Areas covered: This review includes a comprehensive overview of the literatures relevant to vaccine development against the sexually transmitted viruses (STVs) using PubMed and Sciencedirect electronic search engines. Herein, we discuss the efforts directed toward development of effective vaccines using different laboratory animal models including mice, guinea pig or non-human primates in preclinical trials, and human in clinical trials with different phases. Expert opinion: There is no effective FDA approved vaccine against the sexually transmitted viruses (STVs) except for HBV and HPV as prophylactic vaccines. Many attempts are underway to develop vaccines against these viruses. There are several approaches for improving prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines such as heterologous prime/boost immunization, delivery system, administration route, adjuvants, etc. In this line, further studies can be helpful for understanding the immunobiology of STVs in human. Moreover, development of more relevant animal models is a worthy goal to induce effective immune responses in humans.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17512433.2020.1814743;4.1;4.2;5.1;17512433;;;;

RECENT FINDINGS: In new human and nonhuman primate (NHP) vaccine trials as well as studies of natural infection, Fc-mediated effector responses have sometimes been observed to correlate with decreased risk of infection or with better clinical outcomes, suggesting a potential role for these responses in HIV-1 prevention and therapy. Recent highlights include use of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-sensitizing CD4-induced mimetic compounds, novel V1V2 immunogens, passive transfer studies, and vaccine regimens that successfully elicited Fc-mediated responses and were reported to decrease risk of infection in challenge studies in NHPs. Lastly, detailed studies of IgG3 forms of HIV-specific antibodies have reported that both neutralizing and Fc-mediated responses can be increased relative to the more prevalent IgG1 subclass. SUMMARY: Successful harmonization of neutralizing and Fc-mediated responses may make key contributions to the goal of reducing HIV-1 infection via active and passive vaccination. New studies continue to highlight the importance of Fc-mediated antibody responses as correlates of decreased risk of infection and suggest enhanced phagocytosis is a potential mechanism of reduced risk of infection associated with human IgG3 responses. Results from recent studies may help guide the rational design of therapies and vaccines that aim to specifically leverage antibody effector function.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/COH.0000000000000638;7.5;7.2;7.8;;;;;

Profiles of HIV drug resistance mutations (HIVDRM) and virological failure (VF) are not extensively studied in Tanzania. This study aimed to determine HIVDRM and predictors of VF in HIV-infected individuals failing first-line HIV drugs in Moshi, Northern Tanzania. A case-control study was conducted at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre, Mawenzi, Pasua and Majengo health facilities with HIV-care and treatment clinics from October, 2017 to August, 2018. Cases and controls were HIV-infected individuals with VF and viral suppression (VS) respectively. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease genes were amplified and sequenced. Stanford University’s HIV drug resistance database and REGA subtyping tool 3.0 determined HIVDRM and HIV-1 subtypes respectively. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) investigated predictors of VF. P-value < 5% was considered statistically significant. A total of 124 participants were recruited, of whom 63 (50.8%) had VF, 61 (49.2%) had VS and 82 (66.1%) were females. Median [IQR] age and duration on ART were 45 [35–52] years and 72 [48–104] months respectively. Twenty-five out of 26 selected samples from cases were successfully sequenced. Twenty-four samples (96%) had at least one major mutation conferring resistance to HIV drugs, with non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-resistance associated mutations as the majority (92%). Frequent NNRTI-resistance associated mutations were K103N (n = 11), V106M (n = 5) and G190A (n = 5). Prevalent nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors-resistance associated mutations were M184V (n = 17), K70R (n = 7) and D67N (n = 6). Dual-class resistance was observed in 16 (64%) samples. Thirteen samples (52%) had at least one thymidine analogue-resistance associated mutation (TAM). Three samples (12%) had T69D mutation with at least 1 TAM. Two samples (8%) had at least one mutation associated with protease inhibitor resistance. Age [aOR = 0.94, 95% CI (0.90–0.97), p < 0.001] and occupation [aOR = 0.35, 95% CI (0.12–1.04), p = 0.059] associated with VF. In conclusion, HIV drug resistance is common among people failing antiretroviral therapy. Resistance testing will help to guide switching of HIV drugs.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232649;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

The aim of this study was to examine the potential link between HSV-2 infection and HIV disease progression, in addition to identifying the presence of genes conferring HIV antiretroviral resistance mutations. This was a cross-sectional study involving 302 HIV-infected adults in Central Africa with virological failure (viral load >1000 copies/mL) on first-line antiretroviral therapy from four different countries. The seroprevalence of HSV-2 was 32% (96/302). Amongst the HIV-infected individuals who were HSV-2 seropositive, the mean HIV viral load and CD4 count were 4.82 ± 0.83 log copies/mL and 243 ± 144 cells/microliter, respectively. Among the HIV-infected individuals who were HSV-2-seronegative, the mean HIV viral load and CD4 count were 3.48 ± 0.44 log copies/mL and 646 ± 212 cells/microliter, respectively (p < 0.001). There was a statistically significant relationship (p < 0.001) between HSV-2 seropositivity and the presence of resistance mutations to antiretrovirals (ARV), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) with odds ratios of 9.7, 10, and 11.9, respectively. There was no link between HSV-2 serostatus and protease inhibitor (PI) resistance mutations. There was a substantial accumulation of resistance mutations in HSV-2-seropositive compared to -seronegative patients. These findings support the link between HIV disease progression and HSV-2 infection. An association was observed between the presence of NNRTI and NRTI resistance mutations and HSV-2 seropositivity.;https://www.mdpi.com/2414-6366/5/3/136;0;0;2.0;;;;;

Two thirds of the vaccinees contained the chronic SIVsmE543-3 infection (controllers), whereas one third did not (noncontrollers). In this study, we investigated immune correlates of heterologous challenge control in rhesus macaques of Burmese origin. Because depletion of CD8+ cells in the controllers by administration of anti-CD8a Ab abrogated the control of viral replication, CD8+ cells were required for the protective immune response. However, classical SIV-specific CD8+ T cells did not account for the protective immune response in all controllers. Instead, IL-15-responding CD8a+ cells, including CD8+ T and NK cells, were significantly higher in the controllers than those in the noncontrollers, before and after vaccination with deglycosylated SIV. It is well established that IL-15 signal transduction occurs through ""trans-presentation""in which IL-15 complexed with IL-15Ra on monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells binds to IL-15 Rb/g expressed on CD8+ T and NK cells. Accordingly, levels of IL-15 stimulation were strongly affected by the depletion of monocytes from PBMCs, implying key roles of innate immune cells. These results suggest that intrinsic IL-15 responsiveness may dictate the outcome of protective responses and may lead to optimized formulations of future broadly protective HIV vaccines.";http://www.jimmunol.org/lookup/doi/10.4049/jimmunol.1901431;9.2;8.7;8.3;00221767;;;;

The HRP-linked immunoassay functions by moving magnetic beads bound to a capture antibody through different aqueous phases containing immunoassay reagents. HRP-catalyzed oxidation of 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) is used to mediate AuNRs etching for producing various color changes. Multiple etching processes can be activated by simple mixing of the reagents from the reagent storage reservoir. The fully integrated strategy with sample-in answer-out capability is initiated by simple chip manipulation and finally concluded by converting recognition of antigen-antibody into a vivid color variation for direct visualization and semiquantitative analysis. By bare eye observation, our integrated multicolor immunosensor allows sensitive and reliable semiquantitative analysis of HIV-1 p24 within 1 h. The microfluidic chip device demonstrated here simplifies the operation significantly and thus allows broader application of a multicolor immunosensor for point of care (POC) testing in low-resource settings.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02091;10.7;10.2;10.5;00032700;;;;

All Rights Reserved.The currently recommended first-line therapy for HIV-1-infected patients is an integrase (IN) strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), either dolutegravir (DTG) or bictegravir (BIC), in combination with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Both DTG and BIC potently inhibit most INSTI-resistant IN mutants selected by the INSTIs raltegravir (RAL) and elvitegravir (EVG). BIC has not been reported to select for resistance in treatment-naive patients, and DTG has selected for a small number of resistant viruses in treatment-naive patients. However, some patients who had viruses with substitutions selected by RAL and EVG responded poorly when switched to DTG-based therapies, and there are mutants that cause a considerable decrease in the potencies of DTG and BIC in in vitro assays. The new INSTI cabotegravir (CAB), which is in late-stage clinical trials, has been shown to select for novel resistant mutants in vitro. Thus, it is important to develop new and improved INSTIs that are effective against all the known resistant mutants. This led us to test our best inhibitors, in parallel with DTG, BIC, and CAB, in a single-round infection assay against a panel of the new CAB-resistant mutants. Of the INSTIs we tested, BIC and our compound 4d had the broadest efficacy. Both were superior to DTG, as evidenced by the data obtained with the IN mutant T66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/Q148R/S230N, which was selected by CAB using an EVG-resistant lab strain. These results support the preclinical development of compound 4d and provide information that can be used in the design of additional INSTIs that will be effective against a broad spectrum of resistant mutants.;https://aac.asm.org/content/64/9/e00611-20;7.8;7.9;8.3;00664804;;;;

However, the rapid development of drug resistance creates challenges, such that generation of more effective therapies is not only warranted but a necessary endeavour. This review discusses a group of HIV-1 entry inhibitors known as CD4 mimics which exploit the highly conserved relationship between the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein and the receptor, CD4. RECENT FINDINGS: We review the structure/function guided evolution of these inhibitors, vital mechanistic insights that underpin broad and potent functional antagonism, recent evidence of utility demonstrated in animal and physiologically relevant in-vitro models, and current progress towards effective new-generation inhibitors.

A functional variant of this gene has been identified to play a protective role in multiple autoimmune diseases. The goal of this study was to evaluate the involvement of this variant of TYK2 in vasculitides [giant cell arteritis (GCA), ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) and IgA vasculitis (IgAV)] and viral infections [hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1)]. Methods The study sample was composed of 13,745 European individuals. The genotyping was performed by Immunochip and TaqMan 5’allele discrimination assays and the allele frequencies were compared using PLINK. Results Although the results obtained did not reach the genome-wide level of significance, p-values at nominal significance were observed, suggesting that the TYK2 variant provides protection against two vasculitides: GCA (p=5.94E-3; OR (95%CI) = 0.56 (0.37–0.85) and AAV (p=6.79E-3; OR (95%CI) = 0.65 (0.47–0.89). However, this variant was not found to be associated with IgAV. No evidence was gained that the TYK2 variant confers susceptibility to HCV and HIV-1 infection. Conclusion This is the first study to propose the association between the TYK2 and both GCA and AAV. Our findings also suggest that TYK2 does not play a relevant role in IgAV or in susceptibility to HCV and HVI-1.";None;4.4;4.8;4.5;0392856X;;;;

In this communication, we demonstrate the efficient transfection of a 15.5 kb green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused HIV-1 molecular clone with a nucleic acid delivery system prepared from the highly potent peptide-mimicking cationic lipid OH4 in a mixture with the phospholipid DOPE (co-lipid). For the transfection, liposomes were loaded using a large-sized plasmid (15.5 kb), which encodes a replication-competent HIV type 1 molecular clone that carries a Gag-internal green fluorescent protein (HIV-1 JR-FL Gag-iGFP). The particle size and charge of the generated nanocarriers with 15.5 kb were compared to those of a standardized 4.7 kb plasmid formulation. Stable, small-sized lipoplexes could be generated independently of the length of the used DNA. The transfer of fluorescently labeled pDNA-HIV1-Gag-iGFP in HEK293T cells was monitored using confocal laser scanning microscopy (cLSM). After efficient plasmid delivery, virus particles were detectable as budding structures on the plasma membrane. Moreover, we observed a randomized distribution of fluorescently labeled lipids over the plasma membrane. Obviously, a significant exchange of lipids between the drug delivery system and the cellular membranes occurs, which hints toward a fusion process.

Protease and reverse transcriptase sequences provided by each genotype test were used in the phylogenetic study, performed first by the neighbor-joining method and then confirmed by Bayesian analysis. We collected clinical, immunovirological, and demographic data for all patients included. Our cohort comprised 757 patients, 428 (56.5%) belonging to a TC. Overall, we found 123 TCs, 21 of them comprising five or more individuals and three with 10 sequences. Forty-three TCs (35.0%) remained active. The clustered patients were mainly men (92.8%) who had sex with men (MSM) (81.5%), Spanish (80.6%), and young adults (median age at diagnosis of 32.6 years). They had lower percentages of late diagnosis and AIDS cases (42.1% and 13.6%, respectively), whereas the presence of recent seroconverters (31.1%), HIV-1 B subtypes (79.4%), and transmission drug resistance (20.3%) increased within TCs, with regard to not-clustered individuals. Among the TCs of non-B variants, circulating recombinant forms (CRF) were predominant (87.5%), with the highest frequencies for CRF19_cpx (17.0% of non-B subtype sequences in TCs); CRF02_AG (15.9%); and CRF01_AE (9.1%). In conclusion, over half of our cohort was included within a TC. More than a third of TCs found could be considered active transmission events. Belonging to a TC was related to MSM, Spanish origin, recent seroconversion, high prevalence of resistance mutations, and B HIV subtype. Among the non-B genetic forms in TCs, we found a high prevalence of CRF19_cpx, CRF02_AG, and CRF01_AE variants.";https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/mdr.2019.0344;3.9;3.6;3.9;10766294;;;;

Published by BMJ.Introduction Adolescents living with HIV have poor antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and viral suppression outcomes. Viral load (VL) monitoring could reinforce adherence but standard VL testing requires strong laboratory capacity often only available in large central laboratories. Thus, coordinated transport of samples and results between the clinic and laboratory is required, presenting opportunities for delayed or misplaced results. Newly available point-of-care (POC) VL testing systems return test results the same day and could simplify VL monitoring so that adolescents receive test results faster which could strengthen adherence counselling and improve ART adherence and viral suppression. Methods and analysis This non-blinded randomised clinical trial is designed to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of POC VL testing compared with standard laboratory-based VL testing among adolescents and youth living with HIV in Haiti. A total of 150 participants ages 10-24 who have been on ART for >6 months are randomised 1:1 to intervention or standard arms. Intervention arm participants receive a POC VL test (Cepheid Xpert HIV-1 Viral Load system) with same-day result and immediate ART adherence counselling. Standard care participants receive a laboratory-based VL test (Abbott m2000sp/m2000rt) with the result available 1 month later, at which time they receive ART adherence counselling. VL testing is repeated 6 months later for both arms. The primary objective is to describe the implementation of POC VL testing compared with standard laboratory-based VL testing. The secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of POC VL testing on VL suppression at 6 months and participant comprehension of the correlation between VL and ART adherence. Ethics and dissemination This study is approved by GHESKIO, Weill Cornell Medicine and Columbia University ethics committees. This trial will provide critical data to understand if and how POC VL testing may impact adolescent ART adherence and viral suppression. If effective, POC VL testing could routinely supplement standard laboratory-based VL testing among high-risk populations living with HIV.

In this study, we screened platelets from recently infected individuals, before and after antiretroviral therapy, for the presence of virus and examined platelet activation, as well as CD41 T-cell recovery. This was followed by in vitro studies assessing platelet-CD41 T-cell complex formation as a contributing factor to viral transmission. HIV1 platelets were detected in 10 of 10 acutely infected individuals with no prior history of antiretroviral therapy. The percentage of HIV1 platelets dropped significantly after 3 months of antiretroviral therapy in all of the study participants. These individuals also demonstrated significant recovery of CD41 T cells. Interestingly, the percentage of HIV1 platelets correlated positively with viral load but not with CD41 T-cell count. Furthermore, we found that platelet activation with soluble CD40L or thrombin receptor activator peptide 6 (TRAP6) increased platelet-virus interactions in vitro. TRAP6-mediated interactions were reduced by platelet antagonists, aspirin, and R406. We demonstrated that platelets transmit the virus to CD41 T cells, and this transinfection was abolished by inhibiting platelet-T-cell complex formation via exposure to an anti-CD62P antibody. Additionally, treatment with TRAP6 significantly increased the transinfection, which was also inhibited by aspirin and R206. These results reveal that platelets have the potential to promote HIV viral spread during the acute stage of infection, by harboring infectious virus transmitting infection to susceptible CD41 T cells through complex formation.;https://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article/4/18/4512/463771/Platelets-function-as-an-acute-viral-reservoir;0;1.0;4.0;24739529;;;;

The kinase activity of DNA-PK is required for efficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). We also showed that the kinase activity of DNA-PK is essential for post-integrational DNA repair in the case of HIV-1 infection. Besides, DNA-PK is known to participate in such cellular processes as protection of mammalian telomeres, transcription, and some others where the need for its phosphorylating activity is not clearly elucidated. We carried out a systematic search and analysis of DNA-PK targets described in the literature and identified 67 unique DNA-PK targets phosphorylated in response to various in vitro and/or in vivo stimuli. A functional enrichment analysis of DNA-PK targets and determination of protein-protein associations among them were performed. For 27 proteins from these 67 DNA-PK targets, their participation in the HIV-1 life cycle was demonstrated. This information may be useful for studying the functioning of DNA-PK in various cellular processes, as well as in various stages of HIV-1 replication.;https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/9/8/1907;0;0;0;;;;;

These pleiotropic roles make CXCR4 an attractive target to mitigate human disorders. Here a new class of symmetrical polyamines was designed and synthesized as potential small molecule CXCR4 antagonists. Among them, a representative compound 21 (namely HF50731) showed strong CXCR4 binding affinity (mean IC50 = 19.8 nM) in the CXCR4 competitive binding assay. Furthermore, compound 21 significantly inhibited SDF-1-induced calcium mobilization and cell migration, and blocked HIV-1 infection via antagonizing CXCR4 coreceptor function. The structure-activity relationship analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular docking were conducted to further elucidate the binding mode of compound 21, suggesting that compound 21 could primarily occupy the minor subpocket of CXCR4 and partially bind in the major subpocket by interacting with residues W94, D97, D171, and E288.

More than 50 different transcripts can be generated from a single HIV-1 unspliced pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) and a balanced proportion of unspliced and spliced transcripts is critical for the production of infectious virions. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the regulation of viral RNA is therefore of potential therapeutic interest. However, monitoring the regulation of alternative splicing events at a transcriptome-wide level during cell infection is challenging. Here we used the long-read cDNA sequencing developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to explore in a quantitative manner the complexity of the HIV-1 transcriptome regulation in infected primary CD4+ T cells. Results: ONT reads mapping to the viral genome proved sufficiently long to span all possible splice junctions, even distant ones, and to be assigned to a total of 150 exon combinations. Fifty-three viral RNA isoforms, including 14 new ones were further considered for quantification. Relative levels of viral RNAs determined by ONT sequencing showed a high degree of reproducibility, compared favourably to those produced in previous reports and highly correlated with quantitative PCR (qPCR) data. To get further insights into alternative splicing regulation, we then compiled quantifications of splice site (SS) usage and transcript levels to build ""splice trees"", a quantitative representation of the cascade of events leading to the different viral isoforms. This approach allowed visualizing the complete rewiring of SS usages upon perturbation of SS D2 and its impact on viral isoform levels. Furthermore, we produced the first dynamic picture of the cascade of events occurring between 12 and 24 h of viral infection. In particular, our data highlighted the importance of non-coding exons in viral RNA transcriptome regulation. Conclusion: ONT sequencing is a convenient and reliable strategy that enabled us to grasp the dynamic of the early splicing events modulating the viral RNA landscape in HIV-1 infected cells.";https://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12977-020-00533-1;7.3;6.7;6.7;;;;;

Biological activity results demonstrated that most of these derivatives possessed good inhibitory on the kinase activity of CDK9 such as blocking its phosphorylation function and inhibiting HIV-1 transcription. Compound 12i was found to be the most potent CDK9 inhibitor and exhibited excellent anticancer activity against HepG2, A375, MCF-7, and A549, but low toxic on normal cells including HaCaT and MCF-10A. Further studies revealed that as a result of CDK9 inhibition and subsequent inhibition of phosphorylation at Serine 2 of the RNAPII CTD, the representative compound 12i dose-dependently increased cleaved PARP level, exerting its antiproliferative effect through induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. Finally, the molecular docking analysis implied that 12i had a good binding affinity with CDK9.

This report demonstrates the optimization of this type of antibodies via chemical modification of regions near the membrane but not directly involved in the recognition of the epitope. Using the HIV-1 antibody 10E8 as a model, linear and polycyclic synthetic aromatic compounds are introduced at selected sites. Molecular dynamics simulations predict the favorable interactions of these synthetic compounds with the viral lipid membrane, where the epitope of the HIV-1 glycoprotein Env is located. Chemical modification of 10E8 with aromatic acetamides facilitates the productive and specific recognition of the native antigen, partially buried in the crowded environment of the viral membrane, resulting in a dramatic increase of its capacity to block viral infection. These observations support the harnessing of interfacial affinity through site-selective chemical modification to optimize the function of antibodies that target membrane-proximal epitopes.© 2020 The Author(s)Rujas et al. describe the site-selective chemical modification of antibodies to improve the molecular recognition of epitopes at membrane surfaces.

The loading of metal ions further enhances Lewis acidity, augmenting the activity associated with such frameworks. Metal-loaded ionic POFs, however, often suffer from physicochemical instability, thereby limiting their scope for diverse applications. Herein, we report the fabrication of triaminoguanidinium-based ionic POFs through Schiff base condensation in a cost-effective and scalable manner. The resultant N-rich ionic frameworks facilitate selective CO2 uptake and afford high metal (Zn(ii): 47.2%) loading capacity. Owing to the ionic guanidinium core and ZnO infused mesoporous frameworks, Zn/POFs showed pronounced catalytic activity in the cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxides into cyclic organic carbonates under solvent-free conditions with high catalyst recyclability. The synergistic effect of infused ZnO and cationic triaminoguanidinium frameworks in Zn/POFs led to robust antibacterial (Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative, Escherichia coli) and antiviral activity targeting HIV-1 and VSV-G enveloped lentiviral particles. We thus present triaminoguanidinium-based POFs and Zn/POFs as a new class of multifunctional materials for environmental remediation and biomedical applications.;http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=D0SC01658F;14.7;15.8;15.5;20416520;;;;

The key function of Vif is to disrupt the antiviral activity of host APOBEC3 (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3) proteins, which mutate viral nucleic acids. Inside the cell, Vif binds to the host cell proteins Elongin-C, Elongin-B, and core-binding factor subunit , forming a four-protein complex called VCBC. The structure of VCBC-Cullin5 has recently been solved by X-ray crystallography, and, using molecular dynamics simulations, the dynamics of VCBC have been characterized. Here, we applied time-lapse high-speed atomic force microscopy to visualize the conformational changes of the VCBC complex. We determined the three most favorable conformations of this complex, which we identified as the triangle, dumbbell, and globular structures. Moreover, we characterized the dynamics of each of these structures. Our data revealed the very dynamic behavior of all of them, with the triangle and dumbbell structures being the most dynamic. These findings provide insight into the structure and dynamics of the VCBC complex and may support efforts to improve HIV treatment, because Vif is essential for virus survival in the cell.;http://www.jbc.org/lookup/doi/10.1074/jbc.RA120.014442;8.2;7.7;7.4;;;;;

However, current anti-HIV CARs are limited by targeting a single epitope of the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp160, which cannot counter the enormous diversity and mutability of viruses. Here, we report the development of a universal CAR-NK cell, which recognizes 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) and can subsequently be redirected to target various epitopes of gp160 using DNP-conjugated antibodies as adaptor molecules. We show that this CAR-NK cell can recognize and kill mimic HIV-infected cell lines expressing subtypes B and C gp160. We additionally find that anti-gp160 antibodies targeting membrane-distal epitopes (including V1/V2, V3, and CD4bs) are more likely to activate universal CAR-NK cells against gp160+ target cells, compared with those targeting membrane-proximal epitopes located in the gp41 MPER. Finally, we confirm that HIV-infected primary human CD4+ T cells can be effectively killed using the same approach. Given that numerous anti-gp160 antibodies with different antigen specificities are readily available, this modular universal CAR-NK cell platform can potentially overcome HIV diversity, thus providing a promising strategy to eradicate HIV-infected cells.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acschembio.0c00537;8.4;7.9;7.9;15548929;;;;

Therefore, the latent reservoir is the main target for an HIV cure. Here, we studied the direct link between integration site and transcription using LEDGINs and Barcoded HIV-ensembles (B-HIVE). LEDGINs are antivirals that inhibit the interaction between HIV-1 integrase and the chromatin-tethering factor LEDGF/p75. They were used as a tool to retarget integration, while the effect on HIV expression was measured with B-HIVE. B-HIVE tracks insert-specific HIV expression by tagging a unique barcode in the HIV genome. We confirmed that LEDGINs retarget integration out of gene-dense and actively transcribed regions. The distance to H3K36me3, the marker recognized by LEDGF/p75, clearly increased. LEDGIN treatment reduced viral RNA expression and increased the proportion of silent provirus. Finally, silent proviruses obtained after LEDGIN treatment were located further away from epigenetic marks associated with active transcription. Interestingly, proximity to enhancers stimulated transcription irrespective of LEDGIN treatment, while the distance to H3K36me3 only changed after treatment with LEDGINs. The fact that proximity to these markers are associated with RNA expression support the direct link between provirus integration site and viral expression.;https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/14/7801/5864711;19.7;20.2;21.1;;;;;

All rights reserved.A scalable approach for quantifying intact HIV-1 proviruses is critical for basic research and clinical trials directed at HIV-1 cure. The intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) is a novel approach to characterizing the HIV-1 reservoir, focusing on the genetic integrity of individual proviruses independent of transcriptional status. It uses multiplex digital droplet PCR to distinguish and separately quantify intact proviruses, defined by a lack of overt fatal defects such as large deletions and APOBEC3G-mediated hypermutation, from the majority of proviruses that have such defects. This distinction is important because only intact proviruses cause viral rebound on ART interruption. To evaluate IPDA performance and provide benchmark data to support its implementation, we analyzed peripheral blood samples from 400 HIV-1+ adults on ART from several diverse cohorts, representing a robust sample of treated HIV-1 infection in the United States. We provide direct quantitative evidence that defective proviruses greatly outnumber intact proviruses (by >12.5 fold). However, intact proviruses are present at substantially higher frequencies (median, 54/106 CD4+ T cells) than proviruses detected by the quantitative viral outgrowth assay, which requires induction and in vitro growth (1/106 CD4+ T cells). IPDA amplicon signal issues resulting from sequence polymorphisms were observed in only 6.3% of individuals and were readily apparent and easily distinguished from low proviral frequency, an advantage of the IPDA over standard PCR assays which generate false-negative results in such situations. The large IPDA dataset provided here gives the clearest quantitative picture to date of HIV-1 proviral persistence on ART.;http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2006816117;17.1;16.1;15.7;00278424;;;;

CD4+ T cells which play an important role in immune protection, are the primary targets for HIV infection. The hallmark of HIV infection is the progressive loss in population of CD4+ T cells. However, the pathway causing this slow T cell decline is poorly understood [16]. This paper studies a discontinuous mathematical model for HIV-1 infection, to investigate the effect of pyroptosis on the disease. For this purpose, we use the theory of discontinuous dynamical systems. In this way, we can better analyze the dynamical behavior of the HIV-1 system. Especially, considering the dynamics of the system on its discontinuity boundary enables us to obtain more comprehensive results rather than the previous researches. A stability region for the system, corresponding to its equilibria on the discontinuity boundary, will be determined. In such a parametric region, the trajectories of the system will be trapped on the discontinuity manifold forever. It is also shown that in the obtained stability region, the disease can lead to a steady state in which the population of uninfected T cells and viruses will preserve at a constant level of cytokines. This means that the pyroptosis will be restricted and the disease cannot progress for a long time. Some numerical simulations based on clinical and experimental data are given which are in good agreement with our theoretical results.;https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S1793524520500412;1.6;1.6;1.9;17935245;;;;

All patients' were on Tenofovir plus Boosted Protease inhibitors when neurocognitive symptoms were manifest. 4/6 patients had an acute onset of clinical presentation. CSF showed elevated protein and mild pleocytosis in all patients. Median nadir CD4 T cell count was 222 cells / l and at presentation of HAND with CSF escape was 374 cells / l.

However, drug resistance, off-target effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and varying efficacy in prevention underscore the need to develop novel and alternative therapeutics. In this study, we investigated whether targeting the signaling molecule Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) would inhibit HIV-1 infection and generation of the latent reservoir in primary CD4 T cells. We show that FTY720 (Fingolimod), an FDA-approved functional antagonist of S1P receptors, blocks cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission of HIV and consequently reduces detectable latent virus. Mechanistically, FTY720 impacts the HIV-1 life cycle at two levels. Firstly, FTY720 reduces the surface density of CD4, thereby inhibiting viral binding and fusion. Secondly, FTY720 decreases the phosphorylation of the innate HIV restriction factor SAMHD1 which is associated with reduced levels of total and integrated HIV, while reducing the expression of Cyclin D3. In conclusion, targeting the S1P pathway with FTY720 could be a novel strategy to inhibit HIV replication and reduce the seeding of the latent reservoir.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008679;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

The Brazilian Ministry of Health published a resolution in 2013, recommending the use of RTs for the diagnosis of HIV infection, where one positive RT must be followed by another different RT. This was meant to increase the chance of proper diagnosis in specific settings and special populations. However, data comparing and validating the different HIV RTs available in Brazil are scarce. Therefore, the present study seeks to evaluate eight anti-HIV RTs available in the Brazilian market regarding their analytical performance: sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and accuracy. We also evaluated the agreement between kits (Kappa index) and the quality of the reading pattern of the tests. This was an observational, analytical, and concordance study, in which previously defined positive and negative samples, based on their serological pattern for anti- HIV antibodies (chemiluminescent immunoassay-ECLIA-used as screening and Western Blot used as the confirmatory test) were tested. Analytical performance and Kappa index were calculated, considering a 95% CI and p<0.05. This study identified differences in the performances of the eight tested kits. Six out of eight RTs showed good performance and can be used in the routine laboratory and health care units as screening tests. Regarding the quality of the RT band reading pattern, two brands had several samples showing quite faint bands, thus compromising its use in clinical and laboratory settings.

The significance of the mutants has not been well investigated. Methods: The plasmids of wild type (HIV-1NL4-3) and Env-defective (HIV-1SG3Env) HIV-1 were co-transfected into HEK293T cells. The progeny virus was collected to infect MT4 cells. The env gene and near-full-length genome (NFLG) of HIV-1 were amplified and sequenced. The phylogenetic diversity, recombinant patterns and hotspots, and the functionality of HIV-1 Env were determined. Results: A total of 42 env genes and 8 NFLGs were successfully amplified and sequenced. Five types of recombinant patterns of env were identified and the same recombinant sites were detected in different patterns. The recombination hotspots were found distributing mainly in conservative regions of env. The recombination between genes of HIV-1NL4-3 and HIV-1SG3env increased the variety of viral quasispecies and resulted in progeny viruses with relative lower infectious ability than that of HIVNL4-3. The defective env genes as well as NFLG could be detected after 20 passages. Conclusion: The existence of the defective HIV-1 promotes the phylogenetic evolution of the virus, thus increasing the diversity of virus population. The role of defective genes may be converted from junk genes to useful materials and cannot be neglected in the study of HIV-1 reservoir.;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05288-w;4.5;4.3;4.1;;;;;

While some resistance-related mutations occur near the inhibitor’s binding site, the mutation N155H occurs on the opposite side of the drug-interacting Mg2+ ions, thus, not interacting directly with the drug molecules and currently lacking an explanation for its resistance mechanism. Moreover, mutation N155H and the resistance-related mutation Q148H are mutually exclusive for unknown reasons. In the present study, we use molecular dynamics simulations to understand the impact of the N155H mutation in the HIV-1 integrase structure and dynamics, when alone or in combination with Q148H. Our findings suggest that the Mg2+ ions of the active site adopt different orientations in each of the mutants, causing the catalytic triad residues involved in the ion coordination to adapt their side-chain configurations, completely changing the INSTIs binding site. The change in the ion coordination also seems to affect the flexibility of the terminal viral DNA nucleotide near the active site, potentially impairing the induced-fit mechanism of the drugs. The explanations obtained from our simulations corroborate previous hypotheses drawn from crystallographic studies. The proposed resistance mechanism can also explain the resistance caused by other mutations that take place in the same region of the integrase and help uncover the structural details of other HIV-1 resistance mechanisms.";https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmolb.2020.00170/full;4.2;5.4;5.1;;;;;

In parallel, Calu3 cell lines and PBMCs were in vitro infected with growing doses of SARS-CoV-2 (0.5, 5, 1000 MOI) and HIV-1BAL (0.1, 1, and 10 ng p24 HIV-1Bal/1 × 106 PBMCs) viruses, respectively. Results showed that: (1) ERAP2/Iso3 mRNA expression can be prompted by many pathogens and it is coupled with the modulation of several determinants (cytokines, interferon-stimulated genes, activation/inhibition markers, antigen-presentation elements) orchestrating the anti-microbial immune response (Quantigene); (2) ERAP2/Iso3 mRNA is translated into a protein (western blot); (3) ERAP2/Iso3 mRNA expression is sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 concentration. Considering the key role played by ERAPs in antigen processing and presentation, it is conceivable that these enzymes may be potential targets and modulators of the pathogenicity of infectious diseases and further analyses are needed to define the role played by the different isoforms.";https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/9/9/1951;0;0;0;;;;;

Both ARVs and NAbs prevent new rounds of viral infection, but NAbs may have the additional capacity to accelerate the loss of virus-infected cells through Fc gamma receptor (FcR)-mediated effector functions, which should affect the kinetics of plasma-virus decline. Here, we formally test the role of effector function in vivo by comparing the rate and timing of plasma-virus clearance in response to a single-dose treatment with either unmodified NAb or those with either reduced or augmented Fc function. When infused into viremic simian HIV (SHIV)-infected rhesus macaques, there was a 21% difference in slope of plasma-virus decline between NAb and NAb with reduced Fc function. NAb engineered to increase FcRIII binding and improve antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro resulted in arming of effector cells in vivo, yet led to viral-decay kinetics similar to NAbs with reduced Fc function. These studies show that the predominantmechanism of antiviral activity of HIV NAbs is through inhibition of viral entry, but that Fc function can contribute to the overall antiviral activity, making them distinct from standard ARVs.;http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2008236117;17.1;16.1;15.7;00278424;;;;

Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.Background. GSK2838232 is a second-generation, potent, small-molecule, oral human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) maturation inhibitor for once-daily administration boosted with a pharmacoenhancer. Methods. The phase 2a, proof-of-concept study was an open-label, adaptive dose-ranging design. Safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of GSK2838232 boosted by cobicistat were evaluated in individuals with HIV-1 infection. The study participants (N = 33) received GSK2838232 once daily across a range of doses (20-200 mg) with cobicistat 150 mg for 10 days. Results. GSK2838232 was safe and well tolerated with no clinically meaningful changes in safety parameters or adverse events. Exposure (maximum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the concentration at 24 hours postdose) increased 2- to 3-fold with repeated dosing in an approximately dose-proportional manner, reaching steady-state by day 8 with a half-life (t½) from 16.3 to 19.2 hours. Clearance and t½ values were not dependent on dose. Viral load declined from baseline with all GSK2838232 doses. Mean maximum declines from baseline to day 11 in HIV-1 RNA log10 copies/mL with the 20-mg, 50-mg, 100-mg, and 200-mg cohorts were 0.67, 1.56, 1.32, and 1.70, respectively. CD4+ cell counts increased at doses 50 mg. Conclusions. GSK2838232 with cobicistat was well tolerated and exhibited efficacy as a short-term monotherapy in participants with HIV-1. This positive proof-of-concept study supports the continued development of GSK2838232 for the treatment of HIV as part of combination antiretroviral therapy.;https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/5/1255/5643945;14.0;13.8;12.5;;;;;

However, early HIV infection may be missed by fourth-generation tests especially in settings of high HIV incidence, meaning that recently infected individuals are potentially at risk of transmitting HIV. In 2013, HIV incidence in PEP recipients at the 56 Dean Street clinic was 7.6 per 100 person-years. We therefore wished to see if using a point-of-care PCR HIV test in such individuals would shorten the testing window period and pick up early infections that would be undiagnosed by conventional tests. We compared HIV detection in PEP recipients using the Cepheid GeneXpert® HIV-1 Qual viral load (Qual VL) assay with the standard HIV tests used in our clinical service. Between March 2017 and August 2018, a Qual VL assay was performed in addition to standard baseline HIV tests in consented PEP recipients. Of 494 consented PEP recipients, 476 had valid Qual VL assay results. Of these, 474 (99.6%) had a negative Qual VL result and were also negative on standard baseline HIV tests. Two (0.4%) tested positive for HIV on Qual VL. One of these patients was also HIV-positive on all baseline HIV tests. The other had discordant baseline point-of-care HIV test results. Although no additional HIV infections were diagnosed in PEP recipients using Qual VL, in one individual, it provided confirmation of new HIV infection more quickly than the standard HIV testing pathway.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956462420923883;2.5;2.5;2.7;09564624;;;;

Here, we show that by limiting transcription of specific ceramide synthases, CCR5 signaling reduces ceramide levels and thereby increases T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) nanoclustering in antigen-experienced mouse and human CD4+ T cells. This activity is CCR5-specific and independent of CCR5 co-stimulatory activity. CCR5-deficient mice showed reduced production of high-affinity class-switched antibodies, but only after antigen rechallenge, which implies an impaired memory CD4+ T-cell response. This study identifies a CCR5 function in the generation of CD4+ T-cell memory responses and establishes an antigen-independent mechanism that regulates TCR nanoclustering by altering specific lipid species.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.15252/embj.2020104749;15.0;15.5;16.4;02614189;;;;

The effect of HIV-1 Tat on reverse transcription has long been described in the literature, however, that of HIV-2 is understudied. Sequence homology between Tat proteins of HIV-1 and 2 is estimated to be less than 30%, and the main difference lies within their N-terminal region. Here, we describe Y44A-inactivating mutation of HIV-2 Tat, studying its effect on capsid production, reverse transcription, and the efficiency of proviral transcription. Investigation of the mutation was performed using sequence-and structure-based in silico analysis and in vitro experiments. Our results indicate that the Y44A mutant HIV-2 Tat inhibited the activity and expression of RT (reverse transcriptase), in addition to diminishing Tat-dependent LTR (long terminal repeat) transactivation. These findings highlight the functional importance of the acidic domain of HIV-2 Tat in the regulation of reverse transcription and transactivation of the integrated provirions.;https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/16/5907;5.1;5.2;5.3;16616596;;;;

We sought to determine the viral tropism of subtype C (C-HIV) Envelope (Env) clones for different CD4+ T cell subsets and whether tropism changes during acute to chronic disease progression. HIV-1 envs were amplified from the plasma of five C-HIV infected women from three untreated time points; less than 2 months, 1-year and 3-years post-infection. Pseudoviruses were generated from Env clones, phenotyped for coreceptor usage and CD4+ T cell subset tropism was measured by flow cytometry. Results: A total of 50 C-HIV envs were cloned and screened for functionality in pseudovirus infection assays. Phylogenetic and variable region characteristic analysis demonstrated evolution in envs between time points. We found 45 pseudoviruses were functional and all used CCR5 to mediate entry into NP2/CD4/CCR5 cells. In vitro infection assays showed transitional memory (TM) and effector memory (EM) CD4+ T cells were more frequently infected (median: 46% and 25% of total infected CD4+ T cells respectively) than naïve, stem cell memory, central memory and terminally differentiated cells. This was not due to these subsets contributing a higher proportion of the CD4+ T cell pool, rather these subsets were more susceptible to infection (median: 5.38% EM and 2.15% TM cells infected), consistent with heightened CCR5 expression on EM and TM cells. No inter- or intra-participant changes in CD4+ T cell subset tropism were observed across the three-time points. Conclusions: CD4+ T cell subsets that express more CCR5 were more susceptible to infection with C-HIV Envs, suggesting that these may be the major cellular targets during the first 3 years of infection. Moreover, we found that viral tropism for different CD4+ T cell subsets in vitro did not change between Envs cloned from acute to chronic disease stages. Finally, central memory, naïve and stem cell memory CD4+ T cell subsets were susceptible to infection, albeit inefficiently by Envs from all time-points, suggesting that direct infection of these cells may help establish the latent reservoir early in infection.";https://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12977-020-00532-2;7.3;6.7;6.7;;;;;

Neutralization breadth is notable given that glycan processing can be substantially influenced by the presence or absence of neighboring glycans. Here, using a stabilized recombinant envelope trimer, we investigate the degree to which mutations in the glycan network surrounding an epitope impact the fine glycan processing of antibody targets. Using cryo-electron microscopy and site-specific glycan analysis, we reveal the importance of glycans in the formation of the 2G12 bnAb epitope and show that the epitope is only subtly impacted by variations in the glycan network. In contrast, we show that the PG9 and PG16 glycan-based epitopes at the trimer apex are dependent on the presence of the highly conserved surrounding glycans.

However, there is a gap in the knowledge about the mechanisms that regulate the expression of such host factors. Here, we aimed to assess DNA methylation impact on host genome in natural HIV-1 control. To this end, whole DNA methylome in 70 untreated HIV-1 infected individuals with either high (>50,000 HIV-1-RNA copies/ml, n = 29) or low (<10,000 HIV-1-RNA copies/ml, n = 41) plasma viral load (pVL) levels were compared and identified 2,649 differentially methylated positions (DMPs). Of these, a classification random forest model selected 55 DMPs that correlated with virologic (pVL and proviral levels) and HIV-1 specific adaptive immunity parameters (IFNg-T cell responses and neutralizing antibodies capacity). Then, cluster and functional analyses identified two DMP clusters: cluster 1 contained hypo-methylated genes involved in antiviral and interferon response (e.g. PARP9, MX1, and USP18) in individuals with high viral loads while in cluster 2, genes related to T follicular helper cell (Tfh) commitment (e.g. CXCR5 and TCF7) were hyper-methylated in the same group of individuals with uncontrolled infection. For selected genes, mRNA levels negatively correlated with DNA methylation, confirming an epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Further, these gene expression signatures were also confirmed in early and chronic stages of infection, including untreated, cART treated and elite controllers HIV-1 infected individuals (n = 37). These data provide the first evidence that host genes critically involved in immune control of the virus are under methylation regulation in HIV-1 infection. These insights may offer new opportunities to identify novel mechanisms of in vivo virus control and may prove crucial for the development of future therapeutic interventions aimed at HIV-1 cure.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008678;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

Here we investigated the maternal plasma immunoglobulin, cytokine secretion and the outcome of the exposed infants among the HIV+ HAART treated pregnant women in Nigeria. In this study, different plasma immunoglobulins and cytokines were measured in the HIV+ HAART treated pregnant mothers. Pooled culture supernatants of B and T lymphocytes showed lower levels of IFN-, IL-10 and IL-4. There were lower IFN- and IL-10 secretions at 1st trimester; however, IL-10 continued to be lower throughout 2nd and 3rd trimesters. TNF- secretion significantly decreased as pregnancy progressed to term. There were high plasma IgG and low IgM in the HIV+ HAART treated pregnant women.

However, knockout cells lacking inositol-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPPK-KO), the enzyme that produces IP6 by phosphorylation of inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5), were still able to produce infectious HIV-1 particles at a greatly reduced rate. HIV-1 in vitro assembly can also be stimulated to a lesser extent with IP5, but until recently, it was not known if IP5 could also function in promoting assembly in vivo. Here we addressed whether there is an absolute requirement for IP6 or IP5 in the production of infectious HIV-1 particles. IPPK-KO cells expressed no detectable IP6 but elevated IP5 levels and displayed a 20-100-fold reduction in infectious particle production, correlating with lost virus release. Transient transfection of an IPPK expression vector stimulated infectious particle production and release in IPPK-KO but not wildtype cells. Several attempts to make IP6/IP5 deficient stable cells were not successful, but transient expression of the enzyme multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase-1 (MINPP1) into IPPK-KOs resulted in near ablation of IP6 and IP5. Under these conditions, we found that HIV-1 infectious particle production and virus release were essentially abolished (1000-fold reduction) demonstrating an IP6/IP5 requirement. However, other retroviruses including a Gammaretrovirus, a Betaretrovirus, and two non-primate Lentiviruses displayed only a modest (3-fold) reduction in infectious particle production from IPPK-KOs and were not significantly altered by expression of IPPK or MINPP1. The only other retrovirus found to show a clear IP6/IP5 dependence was the primate (macaque) Lentivirus Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, which displayed similar sensitivity as HIV-1. We were not able to determine if producer cell IP6/IP5 is required at additional steps beyond assembly because viral particles devoid of both molecules could not be generated. Finally, we found that loss of IP6/IP5 in viral target cells had no effect on permissivity to HIV-1 infection.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008646;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

Computational design of protein nanoparticles with differing sizes and geometries enables combination with antigens of choice to test novel multimerization concepts in immunization strategies where the goal is to improve the induction and maturation of neutralizing antibody lineages. Here, we describe detailed antigenic, structural, and functional characterization of computationally designed tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral nanoparticle immunogens displaying trimeric HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) ectodomains. Env trimers, based on subtype A (BG505) or consensus group M (ConM) sequences and engineered with SOSIP stabilizing mutations, were fused to an underlying trimeric building block of each nanoparticle. Initial screening yielded one icosahedral and two tetrahedral nanoparticle candidates, capable of presenting twenty or four copies of the Env trimer. A number of analyses, including detailed structural characterization by cryo-EM, demonstrated that the nanoparticle immunogens possessed the intended structural and antigenic properties. When the immunogenicity of ConM-SOSIP trimers presented on a two-component tetrahedral nanoparticle or as soluble proteins were compared in rabbits, the two immunogens elicited similar serum antibody binding titers against the trimer component. Neutralizing antibody titers were slightly elevated in the animals given the nanoparticle immunogen and were initially more focused to the trimer apex. Altogether, our findings indicate that tetrahedral nanoparticles can be successfully applied for presentation of HIV Env trimer immunogens; however, the optimal implementation to different immunization strategies remains to be determined..";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008665;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

All Rights Reserved.Oregano essential oil has long been known for its health-promoting benefits. Here, we report its activity against viral replication. Oregano oil was found to specifically inhibit lentiviruses, such as human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV), irrespective of virus tropism, but not hepatitis C virus, adenovirus 5 (ADV5), Zika virus, and influenza (H1N1) virus. Oregano oil’s most abundant components, carvacrol and its isomer, thymol, were shown to block virus-target cell fusion while not perturbing other stages of the virus life cycle. We detected changes in virus particle density, suggesting that cholesterol depletion from the HIV-1 envelope membrane reduces virus entry. Furthermore, infection was rescued by adding exogenous cholesterol. The evolution of viral resistance to carvacrol supported this mechanism of action with the identification of mutations in the viral gp41 fusion protein that counteracted cholesterol depletion. In addition, resistance to carvacrol emerged later than typically observed for other clinically used drugs, strengthening its antiviral potential. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed key motifs of carvacrol and thymol required for HIV neutralization and identified previously unknown active analogs. Carvacrol was also shown to additively cooperate with antiretroviral therapy. In sum, oregano oil and improved carvacrol and thymol analogs could be considered to supplement current HIV therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Oregano essential oil has multiple benefits in traditional medicine, cosmetics, and food industries. Carvacrol and its analog, thymol, are well-described components of oregano oil. Here, we show that these compounds inhibit HIV-target cell fusion independently of viral tropism. Our results suggest that carvacrol and thymol alter the cholesterol content of the viral membrane, blocking HIV-1 entry into the target cell. Resistance to carvacrol has selected for viruses with mutations in the viral envelope glycoprotein, gp41. This protein is known for its interaction with cholesterol present in membrane lipid rafts. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of therapies targeting the viral envelope membrane, and oregano oil is a safe supplement to antiretrovirals, potentially delaying disease progression and resistance development.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/15/e00147-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

Prevalence among the country's nearly 105,000 PWID is estimated to be 37.8% but has been shown to be higher in several large urban centers. A lack of public health resources, the common use of professional injectors and unsafe injection practices are believed to have fueled the outbreak. Here we evaluate the molecular characteristics of HIV-1 sequences (n = 290) from PWID in several Pakistani cities to examine transmission dynamics and the association between rates of HIV-1 transmission with regards to regional trends in opioid trafficking. Tip-to-tip (patristic) distance based phylogenetic cluster inferences and BEAST2 Bayesian phylodynamic analyses of time-stamped data were performed on HIV-1 pol sequences generated from dried blood spots collected from 1,453 PWID as part of a cross-sectional survey conducted in Pakistan during 2014/2015. Overall, subtype A1 strains were dominant (75.2%) followed by CRF02_AG (14.1%), recombinants/unassigned (7.2%), CRF35_AD (2.1%), G (1.0%) and C (0.3%). Nearly three quarters of the PWID HIV-1 sequences belonged to one of five distinct phylogenetic clusters. Just below half (44.4%) of individuals in the largest cluster (n = 118) did seek help injecting from professional injectors which was previously identified as a strong correlate of HIV-1 infection. Spikes in estimated HIV-1 effective population sizes coincided with increases in opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, Pakistan's western neighbor. Structured coalescent analysis was undertaken in order to investigate the spatial relationship of HIV-1 transmission among the various cities under study. In general terms, our analysis placed the city of Larkana at the center of the PWID HIV-1 epidemic in Pakistan which is consistent with previous epidemiological data.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237560;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

However, the mechanism(s) underlying this deleterious effect of this HLA allele on HIV-1 infection outcome has not fully understood. CD8+ T cells play a crucial role to control the viral replication but impaired CD8+ T cells represent a major hallmark of HIV-1 infection. Here, we examined the effector functions of CD8+ T cells restricted by HLA-B*35Px (HLA-B*35:03 and HLAB*35:02), HLA-B*27/B57 and non-HLA-B*27/B57 (e.g. HLA-A*01, A*02, A*03, A*11, A*24, A*26, B*40, B*08, B*38, B*44). CD8+ T cells restricted by HLA-B*35Px exhibited an impaired phenotype compared with those restricted by HLA-B*27/B57 and even non-HLA-B*27/B57. CD8+ T cells restricted by non-HLA-B*27/B57 when encountered their cognate epitopes upregulated TIM-3 and thus became suppressed by regulatory T cells (Tregs) via TIM-3: Galectin-9 (Gal-9). Strikingly, CD8+ T cells restricted by HLA-B*35Px expressed fewer TIM-3 and therefore did not get suppressed by Tregs, which was similar to CD8+ T cells restricted by HLA-B*27/B57. Instead, CD8+ T cells restricted by HLA-B*35Px upon recognition of their cognate epitopes upregulated CTLA-4. The transcriptional and impaired phenotype (e.g. poor effector functions) of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells restricted by HLAB*35 was related to persistent CTLA-4, elevated Eomes and blimp-1 but poor T-bet expression. As such, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, Ipilimumab, reversed the impaired proliferative capacity of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells restricted by HLA-B*35Px but not others. This study supports the concept that CD8+ T resistance to Tregs-mediated suppression is related to allele restriction rather than the epitope specificity. Our results aid to explain a novel mechanism for the inability of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells restricted by HLA-B*35Px to control viral replication.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008696;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

HIV-1 requires coreceptor to gain entry into permissive cells to initiate infection. Molecular analysis of the chemokine coreceptor usage is important clinically and in the effective management of AIDS virus. This study aims to determine the coreceptor usage among HIV-1 drug-naive patients residing in the rural Eastern cape, South Africa. We collected blood samples from 55 HIV-infected patients into an anticoagulant vacutainer. RNA was extracted from separated plasma, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed followed by nested polymerase chain reaction to amplify the partial envelope fragment spanning the C2-C3 region. Sanger sequencing was done on the amplicons using the BigDye Terminator V3.1 sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) while sequences were manually edited using BioEdit and Geneious 10.2.6 tools. The WebPSSM and Geno2pheno online tools were also utilized to predict coreceptor tropism while the phylogenetic analysis of the isolates was determined using MEGA 7. Of the 55 blood samples collected for the study, 50 (91%) were successfully amplified and sequenced. The mean age of the patients was 32 (18-56) years while the ratio of men to women was 35% and 65% correspondingly. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all 50 sequences clustered with HIV-1 subtype C reference strains. Viral tropism of the V3 loop revealed 47 sequences to be R5 strains, while three sequences (T1E, T10E, and T11E,) were classified as X4 strains based on the WebPSSM and the Geno2pheno algorithm. HIV-1 R5 tropic strains were the most dominant virus obtained from this study, while HIV-1 subtype C still drives the epidemic in South Africa suggesting greater in vivo and host pathogen fitness. Documented data on mapping out cellular tropism based on viral tropism are important as maraviroc and the other CCR5 antagonist could be introduced as part of the treatment regimen in South Africa.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2020.0066;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;;

While absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) acts a cytosolic sensor of non-self DNA and plays a key role in inflammasome assembly, the -interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) restricts retroviral gene expression by sequestering the transcription factor Sp1. Here, we show that the remaining two human PYHIN proteins, i.e. myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) and pyrin and HIN domain family member 1 (PYHIN1 or IFIX) share this antiretroviral function of IFI16. On average, knock-down of each of these three nuclear PYHIN proteins increased infectious HIV-1 yield from human macrophages by more than an order of magnitude. Similarly, knock-down of IFI16 strongly increased virus transcription and production in primary CD4+ T cells. The N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) plus linker region containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) were generally required and sufficient for Sp1 sequestration and anti-HIV-1 activity of IFI16, MNDA and PYHIN1. Replacement of the linker region of AIM2 by the NLS-containing linker of IFI16 resulted in a predominantly nuclear localization and conferred direct antiviral activity to AIM2 while attenuating its ability to form inflammasomes. The reverse change caused nuclear-to-cytoplasmic relocalization of IFI16 and impaired its antiretroviral activity but did not result in inflammasome assembly. We further show that the Zn-finger domain of Sp1 is critical for the interaction with IFI16 supporting that pyrin domains compete with DNA for Sp1 binding. Finally, we found that human PYHIN proteins also inhibit Hepatitis B virus and simian vacuolating virus 40 as well as the LINE-1 retrotransposon. Altogether, our data show that IFI16, PYHIN1 and MNDA restrict HIV-1 and other viral pathogens by interfering with Sp1-dependent gene expression and support an important role of nuclear PYHIN proteins in innate antiviral immunity.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008752;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

Although mother-to-child human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission has dramatically decreased with maternal antiretroviral therapy, breast milk transmission accounts for most of the 180 000 new infant HIV infections annually. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAb) may further reduce transmission. Methods. A Phase 1 safety and pharmacokinetic study was conducted: a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of 20 or 40 mg/kg (Dose Groups 1 and 2, respectively) of the bNAb VRC01 was administered to HIV-exposed infants soon after birth. Breastfeeding infants (Dose Group 3) received 40 mg/kg SC VRC01 after birth and then 20 mg/kg/dose SC monthly. All infants received appropriate antiretroviral prophylaxis. Results. Forty infants were enrolled (21 in the United States, 19 in Africa). Subcutaneous VRC01 was safe and well tolerated with only mild-to-moderate local reactions, primarily erythema, which rapidly resolved. For multiple-dose infants, local reactions decreased with subsequent injections. VRC01 was rapidly absorbed after administration, with peak concentrations 1-6 days postdose. The 40 mg/kg dose resulted in 13 of 14 infants achieving the serum 50 micrograms (mcg)/mL target at day 28. Dose Group 3 infants maintained concentrations greater than 50 mcg/mL throughout breastfeeding. Conclusions. Subcutaneous VRC01 as single or multiple doses is safe and well tolerated in very young infants and is suitable for further study to prevent HIV transmission in infants.;https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/222/4/628/5611832;10.4;9.2;9.0;00221899;;;;

To investigate the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, this study used an inducible HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) transgenic (iTat-tg) mouse model, which demonstrates brain-specific Tat expression induced by administration of doxycycline. We found that induction of Tat expression in the iTat-tg mice for either 7 or 14 days resulted in a decrease (~30%) in the Vmax of [3H] dopamine uptake via both the dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which was comparable to the magnitude (~35%) of the decrease in Bmax for [3H]WIN 35,428 and [3H]nisoxetine binding to DAT and NET, respectively. The decreased Vmax was not accompanied by a reduction of total or plasma membrane expression of DAT and NET. Consistent with the decreased Vmax for DAT and NET in the PFC, the current study also found an increase in the tissue content of DA and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the PFC of iTattg mice after 7 days' administration of doxycycline. Electrophysiological recordings in layer V pyramidal neurons of the prelimbic cortex from iTat-tg mice found a significant reduction in action potential firing, which was not sensitive to selective inhibitors for DAT and NET, respectively. These findings provide a molecular basis for using the iTat-tg mouse model in the studies of NeuroHIV. Determining the mechanistic basis underlying the interaction between Tat and DAT/NET may reveal novel therapeutic possibilities for preventing the increase in comorbid conditions as well as HAND. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection disrupts dopaminergic neurotransmission, leading to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs). Based on our in vitro and in vivo studies, dopamine uptake via both dopamine and norepinephrine transporters is decreased in the prefrontal cortex of HIV-1 Tat transgenic mice, which is consistent with the increased dopamine and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid contents in this brain region. Thus, these plasma membrane transporters are an important potential target for therapeutic intervention for patients with HAND.;http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/lookup/doi/10.1124/jpet.120.266023;7.4;6.8;5.9;00223565;;;;

All Rights Reserved.If strategies currently in development succeed in eradicating HIV reservoirs in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues, residual sources of virus may remain in anatomic compartments. Paired blood and semen samples were collected from 12 individuals enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled therapeutic vaccine clinical trial in people with HIV (PWH) who began antiretroviral therapy (ART) during acute or early infection (ClinicalTrials registration no. NCT01859325). After the week 56 visit (postintervention), all participants interrupted ART. At the first available time points after viral rebound, we sequenced HIV-1 env (C2-V3), gag (p24), and pol (reverse transcriptase) regions amplified from cell-free HIV RNA in blood and seminal plasma using the MiSeq Illumina platform. Comprehensive sequence and phylogenetic analyses were performed to evaluate viral population structure, compartmentalization, and viral diversity in blood and seminal plasma. Compared to that in blood, HIV RNA rebound in semen occurred significantly later (median of 66 versus 42 days post-ART interruption, P < 0.01) and reached lower levels (median 164 versus 16,090 copies/ml, P < 0.01). Three of five participants with available sequencing data presented compartmentalized viral rebound between blood and semen in one HIV coding region. Despite early ART initiation, HIV RNA molecular diversity was higher in semen than in blood in all three coding regions for most participants. Higher HIV RNA molecular diversity in the genital tract (compared to that in blood plasma) and evidence of compartmentalization illustrate the distinct evolutionary dynamics between these two compartments after ART interruption. Future research should evaluate whether the genital compartment might contribute to viral rebound in some PWH interrupting ART. IMPORTANCE To cure HIV, we likely need to target the reservoirs in all anatomic compartments. Here, we used sophisticated statistical and phylogenetic methods to analyze blood and semen samples collected from 12 persons with HIV who began antiretroviral therapy (ART) during very early HIV infection and who interrupted their ART as part of a clinical trial. First, we found that HIV RNA rebound in semen occurred significantly later and reached lower levels than in blood. Second, we found that the virus in semen was genetically different in some participants compared to that in blood. Finally, we found increased HIV RNA molecular diversity in semen compared to that in blood in almost all study participants. These data suggest that the HIV RNA populations emerging from the genital compartment after ART interruption might not be the same as those emerging from blood plasma. Future research should evaluate whether the genital compartment might contribute to viral rebound in some people with HIV (PWH) interrupting ART.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/15/e00415-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

Phylogenetic analyses were performed on HIV-1 polymerase (pol) sequences to characterise subtypes and identify MTCs, divided into small (SMTCs, 2-3 sequences), medium (MMTCs, 4-9 sequences) and large (LMTCs, 10 sequences). Among 3499 drug-naïve individuals enrolled in the Italian Cohort Naive Antiretroviral (ICONA) cohort (2804 natives; 695 migrants), 726 (20.8%; 644 natives, 82 migrants) were involved in 228 MTCs (6 LMTCs, 36 MMTCs, 186 SMTCs). Migrants contributed 14.4% to SMTCs, 7.6% to MMTCs and 7.1% to LMTCs, respectively. HIV-1 non-B subtypes were found in 51 MTCs; noteworthy was that non-B infections involved in MTCs were more commonly found in natives (n = 47) than in migrants (n = 4). Factors such as Italian origin, being men who have sex with men (MSM), younger age, more recent diagnosis and a higher CD4 count were significantly associated with MTCs. Our findings show that HIV-1 clustering transmission among newly diagnosed individuals living in Italy is prevalently driven by natives, mainly MSM, with a more recent diagnosis and frequently infected with HIV-1 non-B subtypes. These results can contribute to monitoring of the HIV epidemic and guiding the public health response to prevent new HIV infections.";https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/8/791;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

The most important disease progression hallmarks are immune activation and apoptosis. In this study, we address the prevalence of polymorphisms related to proinflammatory and apoptotic genes, such as IFNG (+874T/A), TNF (308G/A), IL6 (174G/C), IL8 (251A/T), FAS (670A/G), and FASL (124A/G) in 160 ethnically mixed HIV-1-infected patients from multicentre cohorts with different clinical outcomes (13 elite controllers [EC], 66 slow long-term non-progressors [LTNPs], and 81 progressors [P]). The genotyping was accomplished by TaqMan-qPCR. Among all the polymorphisms analyzed in the cytokines, the IL6 174G/C polymorphism showed a higher frequency of GG genotype in the LTNP and LTNP+EC groups as compared to the P group. Moreover, there was a significantly higher frequency of the G allele in the LTNP and LTNP+EC groups as compared to the P group. On the other hand, the levels of CD4+ T lymphocytes were higher among individuals showing the AA and AG genotypes for the FASL 124A/G polymorphism as compared to the GG genotype. Furthermore, the AG and AA genotypes were more frequent, as compared to the GG genotype, in individuals showing a lower viral load. In contrast, for the FAS 670A/G polymorphism, a significantly higher viral load was observed in individuals with the AG genotype as compared to the GG genotype. In conclusion, we found three genetic allelic variants of the IL6 174G/C, FASL 124A/G, and FAS 670A/G polymorphisms that were related to disease progression and immunological and virological markers in cohorts of HIV-1-positive ethnically mixed patients.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25651;3.8;3.9;4.0;01466615;;;;

All Rights Reserved.The influence of biological sex on disease progression in HIV-1-infected individuals has been focused on the chronic stage of infection, but little is known about how sex differences influence acute HIV-1 infection. We observed profound differences in viral load and CD4+ T cell activation from the earliest time points in men and women in a Zambian heterosexual acute infection cohort. Women exhibited a 2-fold higher rate of CD4+ T cell loss despite significantly lower viral loads (VL) than men. The importance of studying acute infection was highlighted by the observation that very early in infection, women exhibited significantly higher levels of CD4+ T cell activation, a difference that was lost over the first 3 years of infection as activation in men increased. In women, activation of CD4+ T cells in the acute phase was significantly correlated with plasma levels of 17-estradiol (E2). However, unlike in men, higher CD4+ T cell activation in women was not associated with higher VL. In contrast, a higher E2 level in early infection was associated with lower early and set-point VL in women. We attribute this to an inhibitory effect of estradiol on virus replication, which we were able to observe with relevant transmitted/founder viruses in vitro. Thus, estradiol plays a key role in defining major differences between men and women during early HIV-1 infection by contributing to both viral control and CD4+ T cell loss, an effect that extends into the chronic phase of the disease. IMPORTANCE Previous studies have identified sex-specific differences during chronic HIV-1 infection, but little is known about sex differences in the acute phase, or how disparities in the initial response to the virus may affect disease. We demonstrate that restriction of viral load in women begins during acute infection and is maintained into chronic infection. Despite this, women exhibit more rapid CD4+ T cell loss than men. These profound differences are influenced by 17-estradiol, which contributes both to T cell activation and to reduced viral replication. Thus, we conclude that estradiol plays a key role in shaping responses to early HIV-1 infection that influence the chronic phase of disease.;None;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

However, the effects of antigen copy number, spacing and affinity, as well as the dimensionality and rigidity of scaffold presentation on B-cell activation remain poorly understood. Here, we display the clinical vaccine immunogen eOD-GT8, an engineered outer domain of the HIV-1 glycoprotein-120, on DNA origami nanoparticles to systematically interrogate the impact of these nanoscale parameters on B-cell activation in vitro. We find that B-cell signalling is maximized by as few as five antigens maximally spaced on the surface of a 40-nm viral-like nanoparticle. Increasing antigen spacing up to ~25–30 nm monotonically increases B-cell receptor activation. Moreover, scaffold rigidity is essential for robust B-cell triggering. These results reveal molecular vaccine design principles that may be used to drive functional B-cell responses.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-020-0719-0;65.1;61.1;59.4;17483387;;;;

To understand the mechanisms of this process, we performed genome-wide transcriptional analysis on T cells induced to downregulate CD4 in vitro from AGMs and closely related patas monkeys and T cells that maintain CD4 expression from rhesus macaques. In T cells that downregulated CD4, pathway analysis revealed an atypical regulation of the DNA methylation machinery, which was reversible when pharmacologically targeted with 5-aza-2 deoxycytidine. This signature was driven largely by the dioxygenase TET3, which became downregulated with loss of CD4 expression. CpG motifs within the AGM CD4 promoter region became methylated during CD4 downregulation in vitro and were stably imprinted in AGM CD4-CD8aa+ T cells sorted directly ex vivo. These results suggest that AGMs use epigenetic mechanisms to durably silence the CD4 gene. Manipulation of these mechanisms could provide avenues for modulating SIV and HIV-1 entry receptor expression in hosts that become progressively infected with SIV, which could lead to novel therapeutic interventions aimed to reduce HIV viremia in vivo.;https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/139043;0;2.6;5.8;;;;;

Several clinical trials have evaluated the pharmacokinetics of dapivirine when administered as a 25-mg intravaginal ring. Recent studies have focused on the distribution of dapivirine into breast milk. Drug distribution during lactation and breastfeeding can have implications in terms of infant drug exposure. Thus, sensitive bioanalytical tools are required to characterize the pharmacokinetics of dapivirine in breast milk. Methods: Whole breast milk was spiked with dapivirine and internal standard. Lipid content was disrupted via pre-treatment with n-hexane, and supernatants were subjected to solid phase extraction. Extracted materials were subjected to liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Separation occurred using a Waters BEH C8, 50 × 2.1 mm UPLC column with a 1.7 µm particle size and dapivirine was detected on an API 5000 mass analyzer. Methods were validated in accordance with FDA Bioanalytical Method Validation recommendations. Results: The analytical method was optimized for dapivirine extraction from breast milk. The analytical measuring range of the assay was 10–1000 pg/mL. Calibration curves were generated via weighted linear regression of standards. Intra- and inter-assay precision and accuracy studies demonstrated %CVs  14.6% and %DEVs  ±12.7%. Stability and matrix effects studies were also conducted and deemed acceptable. The method was applied to a previously reported phase 1 clinical trial and demonstrated appropriate performance in the quantitation of dapivirine in breast milk samples from lactating women. Conclusions: An ultrasensitive LC-MS/MS assay has been developed and validated for the quantitation of dapivirine in breast milk. The described method meets validation acceptance criteria and has been applied to a phase 1 clinical trial.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0009912019312160;4.7;4.6;4.5;00099120;S0009912019312160;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0009912019312160;;

These enzymes are cytidine deaminases which transform cytosine into uracil. They preferentially mutate cytidine preceded by thymidine making the 5'TC motif their favored target. Viruses have evolved different strategies to evade APOBEC3 restriction. Certain viruses actively encode viral proteins antagonizing the APOBEC3s, others passively face the APOBEC3 selection pressure thanks to a depleted genome for APOBEC3-targeted motifs. Hence, the APOBEC3s left on the genome of certain viruses an evolutionary footprint. The aim of our study is the identification of these viruses having a genome shaped by the APOBEC3s. We analyzed the genome of 33,400 human viruses for the depletion of APOBEC3-favored motifs. We demonstrate that the APOBEC3 selection pressure impacts at least 22% of all currently annotated human viral species. The papillomaviridae and polyomaviridae are the most intensively footprinted families; evidencing a selection pressure acting genome-wide and on both strands. Members of the parvoviridae family are differentially targeted in term of both magnitude and localization of the footprint. Interestingly, a massive APOBEC3 footprint is present on both strands of the B19 erythroparvovirus; making this viral genome one of the most cleaned sequences for APOBEC3-favored motifs. We also identified the endemic coronaviridae as significantly footprinted. Interestingly, no such footprint has been detected on the zoonotic MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses. In addition to viruses that are footprinted genome-wide, certain viruses are footprinted only on very short sections of their genome. That is the case for the gamma-herpesviridae and adenoviridae where the footprint is localized on the lytic origins of replication. A mild footprint can also be detected on the negative strand of the reverse transcribing HIV-1, HIV-2, HTLV-1 and HBV viruses. Together, our data illustrate the extent of the APOBEC3 selection pressure on the human viruses and identify new putatively APOBEC3-targeted viruses.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008718;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

All Rights Reserved.Butyrate is an abundant metabolite produced by gut microbiota. While butyrate is a known histone deacetylase inhibitor that activates expression of many genes involved in immune system pathways, its effects on virus infections and on the antiviral type I interferon (IFN) response have not been adequately investigated. We found that butyrate increases cellular infection with viruses relevant to human and animal health, including influenza virus, reovirus, HIV-1, human metapneumovirus, and vesicular stomatitis virus. Mechanistically, butyrate suppresses levels of specific antiviral IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) products, such as RIG-I and IFITM3, in human and mouse cells without inhibiting IFN-induced phosphorylation or nuclear translocation of the STAT1 and STAT2 transcription factors. Accordingly, we discovered that although butyrate globally increases baseline expression of more than 800 cellular genes, it strongly represses IFN-induced expression of 60% of ISGs and upregulates 3% of ISGs. Our findings reveal that there are differences in the IFN responsiveness of major subsets of ISGs depending on the presence of butyrate in the cell environment, and overall, they identify a new mechanism by which butyrate influences virus infection of cells. IMPORTANCE Butyrate is a lipid produced by intestinal bacteria. Here, we newly show that butyrate reprograms the innate antiviral immune response mediated by type I interferons (IFNs). Many of the antiviral genes induced by type I IFNs are repressed in the presence of butyrate, resulting in increased virus infection and replication. Our research demonstrates that metabolites produced by the gut microbiome, such as butyrate, can have complex effects on cellular physiology, including dampening of an inflammatory innate immune pathway resulting in a proviral cellular environment. Our work further suggests that butyrate could be broadly used as a tool to increase growth of virus stocks for research and for the generation of vaccines.;None;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

The paper conveys information about the beneficial and negative impacts of cannabinoids on viral infections, especially HIV-1. These include effects on the inflammatory response as well as neuroprotective effects. We also explore non-apoptotic mitochondrial pathways modulated by the activity of cannabinoids, resulting in modifications to cellular functions. As a large part of the literature derives from studies of the nervous system, we first compile the information related to mitochondrial functions in this system, particularly through the CB1 receptor. Finally, we reflect on how this knowledge could complement what has been demonstrated in the immune system, especially in the context of the CB2 receptor and Ca2+ uptake. The overall conclusion of the review is that cannabinoids have the potential to affect a broad range of cell types through mitochondrial modulation, be it through receptor-specific action or not, and that this pathway has a potential implication in cases of viral infection.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/8/875;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

It is hypothesized that a few viral strains may dominate the intra-host genetic diversity with a variety of lower frequency strains comprising the rest of the population. Several software tools currently exist to convert NGS sequence variants into haplotypes. Previous benchmarks of viral haplotype reconstruction programs used simulation scenarios that are useful from a mathematical perspective but do not reflect viral evolution and epidemiology. Here, we tested twelve NGS haplotype reconstruction methods using viral populations simulated under realistic evolutionary dynamics. We simulated coalescent-based populations that spanned known levels of viral genetic diversity, including mutation rates, sample size and effective population size, to test the limits of the haplotype reconstruction methods and to ensure coverage of predicted intra-host viral diversity levels (especially HIV-1). All twelve investigated haplotype callers showed variable performance and produced drastically different results that were mainly driven by differences in mutation rate and, to a lesser extent, in effective population size. Most methods were able to accurately reconstruct haplotypes when genetic diversity was low. However, under higher levels of diversity (e.g., those seen intra-host HIV-1 infections), haplotype reconstruction quality was highly variable and, on average, poor. All haplotype reconstruction tools, except QuasiRecomb and ShoRAH, greatly underestimated intra-host diversity and the true number of haplotypes. PredictHaplo outperformed, in regard to highest precision, recall, and lowest UniFrac distance values, the other haplotype reconstruction tools followed by CliqueSNV, which, given more computational time, may have outperformed PredictHaplo. Here, we present an extensive comparison of available viral haplotype reconstruction tools and provide insights for future improvements in haplotype reconstruction tools using both short-read and long-read technologies.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567134820301088;5.2;4.9;5.0;15671348;S1567134820301088;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1567134820301088;;

We are producing new antibody-based multipurpose prevention technology products to address these problems and fill an unmet need in female reproductive health. We used a Nicotiana platform to manufacture monoclonal antibodies against two prevalent sexually transmitted pathogens, HIV-1 and HSV-2, and incorporated them into a vaginal film (MB66) for preclinical and Phase 1 clinical testing. These tests are now complete and indicate that MB66 is effective and safe in women. We are now developing an antisperm monoclonal antibody to add contraceptive efficacy to this product. The antisperm antibody, H6-3C4, originally isolated by Shinzo Isojima from the blood of an infertile woman, recognizes a carbohydrate epitope on CD52g, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein found in abundance on the surface of human sperm. We engineered the antibody for production in Nicotiana; the new antibody which we call “human contraception antibody,” effectively agglutinates sperm at concentrations >10 g/ml and maintains activity under a variety of physiological conditions. We are currently seeking regulatory approval for a Phase 1 clinical trial, which will include safety and “proof of principle” efficacy endpoints.

To that end, there has been an interest in designing immunofocusing strategies to direct the immune response to specific, conserved regions on antigenic proteins. Modulation of glycosylation is one such immunofocusing strategy; extensive glycosylation is often exploited by pathogens for immune evasion. Masking epitopes on protein immunogens with “self” glycans can also shield the underlying protein surface from humoral immune surveillance. We review recent advances in applying glycosylation as an immunofocusing tool. We also highlight recent interesting work in the HIV-1 field involving the identification and elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies that incorporate glycans into their binding epitopes.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bit.27361;7.8;7.7;7.1;00063592;;;;

TSPANs are primarily present on plasma membranes although they are also found in other biological membranes. They are organized in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs), which allow spatiotemporal tuning of protein functions through the control of their membrane localization. TSPAN6 and TSPAN7 are close paralogs expressed in different tissues, TSPAN7 being highly expressed in the brain. Their functions only started to be unveiled in the late 2000’s and are still poorly understood. Here, we introduce how TSPAN7 was first highlighted has a protein mutated in some forms of X-linked mental retardation, which was later proposed to be caused by defects in neuronal morphogenesis and synaptic transmission. We then discuss the impacts TSPAN7 has on cell morphology of dendritic cells and osteoclasts, through rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton and how TSPAN7 was shown to be a target of autoantibody in patients suffering from type 1 diabetes. Finally, we are addressing the double edge sword that is TSPAN7 in cancer. In the second part of this review, we address the known roles of TSPAN6 and how this protein was shown to participate in synaptic transmission and in amyloid precursor protein secretion, which may contribute to Alzheimer’s disease pathology. We conclude this review by discussing the anti-inflammatory effect of TSPAN6.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00430-020-00681-3;5.3;6.6;4.7;03008584;;;;

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution.Purifying (negative) natural selection is a hallmark of functional biological sequences, and can be detected in protein-coding genes using the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions per site (dN/dS). However, when two genes overlap the same nucleotide sites in different frames, synonymous changes in one gene may be nonsynonymous in the other, perturbing dN/dS. Thus, scalable methods are needed to estimate functional constraint specifically for overlapping genes (OLGs). We propose OLGenie, which implements a modification of the Wei-Zhang method. Assessment with simulations and controls from viral genomes (58 OLGs and 176 non-OLGs) demonstrates low false-positive rates and good discriminatory ability in differentiating true OLGs from non-OLGs. We also apply OLGenie to the unresolved case of HIV-1's putative antisense protein gene, showing significant purifying selection. OLGenie can be used to study known OLGs and to predict new OLGs in genome annotation.

To enable a new generation of anti-viral vaccines, we designed selfassembling protein nanoparticles with geometries tailored to present the ectodomains of influenza, HIV, and RSV viral glycoprotein trimers. We first de novo designed trimers tailored for antigen fusion, featuring N-terminal helices positioned to match the C termini of the viral glycoproteins. Trimers that experimentally adopted their designed configurations were incorporated as components of tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral nanoparticles, which were characterized by cryo-electron microscopy and assessed for their ability to present viral glycoproteins. Electron microscopy and antibody binding experiments demonstrated that the designed nanoparticles presented antigenically intact prefusion HIV-1 Env, influenza hemagglutinin, and RSV F trimers in the predicted geometries. This work demonstrates that antigen-displaying protein nanoparticles can be designed from scratch, and provides a systematic way to investigate the influence of antigen presentation geometry on the immune response to vaccination.;https://elifesciences.org/articles/57659;10.0;10.8;10.8;;;;;

While the sequence of cellular and physiological events that lead to HAND remains obscure, it likely involves chronic neuroinflammation. Host genetic markers that increase the risk for HAND have been reported, but replication of such studies is lacking, possibly due to inconsistent application of a behavioral phenotype across studies. In the current study, we used histopathologic phenotypes in order to validate putative risk alleles for HAND. The National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium, a longitudinal study of the neurologic manifestations of HIV. Data and specimens were obtained from 175 HIV-infected adults. After determining several potential covariates of neurocognitive functioning, we quantified levels of six histopathological markers in the frontal lobe in association with neurocognitive functioning: SYP, MAP 2, HLA-DR, Iba1, GFAP, and -amyloid. We then determined alleles of 15 candidate genes for their associations with neurocognitive functioning and histopathological markers. Finally, we identified the most plausible causal pathway based on our data using a multi-stage linear regression-based mediation analysis approach. None of the genetic markers were associated with neurocognitive functioning. Of the histopathological markers, only MAP 2 and SYP were associated with neurocognitive functioning; however, MAP 2 and SYP did not vary as a function of genotype. Mediation analysis suggests a causal pathway in which presynaptic degeneration (SYP) leads to somatodendritic degeneration (MAP 2) and ultimately neurocognitive impairment. This study did not support the role of host genotype in the histopathology underlying HAND. The findings lend further support for synaptodendritic degeneration as the proximal underlying neuropathological substrate of HAND.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13365-020-00846-z;5.0;4.6;4.7;13550284;;;;

Once more, it has been demonstrated that there is a lack of efficient drugs to control RNA viruses. Aptamers are efficient ligands of a great variety of molecules including proteins and nucleic acids. Their specificity and mechanism of action make them very promising molecules for interfering with the function encoded in viral RNA genomes. RNA viruses store essential information in conserved structural genomic RNA elements that promote important steps for the consecution of the infective cycle. This work describes two well documented examples of RNA aptamers with antiviral activity against highly conserved structural domains of the HIV-1 and HCV RNA genome, respectively, performed in our laboratory. They are two good examples that illustrate the potential of the aptamers to fill the therapeutic gaps in the fight against RNA viruses.;https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/13/8/157;6.1;5.0;5.4;;;;;

METHODS: Early KS-PD and KS-IRIS were assessed in the A5264/AMC-067 trial in which participants with mild-to-moderate AIDS-KS were randomized to initiate ART with either immediate or as-needed oral etoposide. Early KS-PD was defined as tumor progression within 12 weeks of ART initiation. When investigators had concern that early KS-PD was KS-IRIS, additional evaluations were performed. Suspected KS-IRIS was defined as early KS-PD accompanied by a CD4 count increase of 50 cells per cubic millimeter or plasma HIV-1 RNA decrease of 0.5 log10 copies/mL. Clinical outcome was a composite end point categorized as failure, stable, and response at 48 and 96 weeks compared with baseline. RESULTS: Fifty of 190 participants had early KS-PD (27%): 28 had KS-IRIS and 22 were not evaluated for KS-IRIS. Early KS-PD and KS-IRIS incidences with immediate etoposide versus ART alone were 16% versus 39%, and 7% versus 21%, respectively. Week 48 clinical outcome was 45% failure, 18% stable, and 37% response for no early KS-PD; 82% failure, 2% stable, and 16% response for early KS-PD; and 88% failure, 0% stable, and 12% response for KS-IRIS. Cumulative incidence of KS tumor response by week 96 was 64% for no early KS-PD, 22% with early KS-PD, and 18% with KS-IRIS. CONCLUSIONS: Early KS-PD, including suspected KS-IRIS, was common after starting ART for AIDS-KS and was associated with worse long-term clinical outcomes. Starting ART concurrently with etoposide reduced the incidence of both early KS-PD and KS-IRIS compared with ART alone.";https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAI.0000000000002361;6.9;7.0;6.4;;;;;

However, the concurrent production of high titers of baculovirus hinder the purification of these nanoparticles due to similarities in their physicochemical properties. In this study, first a transient gene expression (TGE) method based on the transfection reagent polyethylenimine (PEI) is optimized for the production of HIV-1 VLPs at shake flask level. Furthermore, VLP production by TGE in High Five cells is successfully demonstrated at bioreactor scale, resulting in a higher maximum viable cell concentration (5.1 × 106 cell/mL), the same transfection efficiency and a 1.8-fold increase in Gag-eGFP VLP production compared to shake flasks. Metabolism analysis of High Five cells indicates a reduction in the consumption of the main metabolites with respect to non-transfected cell cultures, and an increase in the uptake rate of several amino acids when asparagine is depleted. Quality assessment by nanoparticle tracking analysis and flow virometry of the VLPs produced shows an average size of 100–200 nm, in agreement with immature HIV-1 viruses reported in the literature. Overall, this work demonstrates that the High Five/TGE system is a suitable approach for the production of VLP-based vaccine candidates and other recombinant proteins.;https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/10/8/1580;0;3.5;4.1;;;;;

Recombinant Env trimers have been studied structurally, but characterization of Env embedded in intact virus membranes has been limited to low resolution. Here, we deploy cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to determine the structures of Env trimers on aldrithiol-2 (AT-2)-inactivated virions in ligand-free, antibody-bound and CD4-bound forms at subnanometer resolution. Tomographic reconstructions document molecular features consistent with high-resolution structures of engineered soluble and detergent-solubilized Env trimers. One of three conformational states previously predicted by smFRET was not observed by cryo-ET, potentially owing to AT-2 inactivation. We did observe Env trimers to open in situ in response to CD4 binding, with an outward movement of gp120-variable loops and an extension of a critical gp41 helix. Overall features of Env trimer embedded in AT-2-treated virions appear well-represented by current engineered trimers.";http://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-020-0452-2;20.9;20.5;19.1;15459993;;;;

This cross-sectional study enrolled 170 HIV-1-infected individuals of three major ethnicities who attended three HIV outpatient clinics in Malaysia. Questionnaire was used to obtain sociodemographic data while CD4 count and viral load data were gathered from hospital's record. Multiple factors were assessed for their predictive effects on CD4 count recovery (500 cells/mm3) and viral load suppression (50 copies/mL) using binary logistic regression. Most of the subjects were male (149/87.6%), in the age group 30 to 39 years old (78/45.9%) and got infected via homosexual contact (82/48.2%). Indians were associated with 11 times higher chance for CD4 recovery as compared to Malays at 8 to 12 months of HAART (adjusted OR: 10.948, 95% CI: 1.873, 64.001, P =.008). Viral load suppression was positively influenced by intravenous drug use (IVDU) status (adjusted OR: 35.224, 95% CI: 1.234, 1000.489, P =.037) at 4 to 6 months of HAART. Higher pretreatment CD4 count was a positive predictor for both initial immunological and virological responses while higher pretreatment viral load was a negative predictor for virological suppression only. In conclusion, ethnicity plays a significant role in determining early immune reconstitution in Malaysia, besides pretreatment CD4 count. Further studies are needed to identify possible biological factors underlying this association.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25680;3.8;3.9;4.0;01466615;;;;

The underlying presence of the M184V/I mutation may undermine virological outcomes of ART, particularly in the context of proposed treatment with two-drug combinations that include drugs affected by M184V, such as lamivudine. In suppressed patients for whom historical data are seldom available, resistance assays evaluating integrated viral DNA can help select a fully active switch regimen. OBJECTIVES: To compare detectability of M184V/I in historical HIV-1 RNA analyses versus HIV-1 DNA sequencing. METHODS: We analysed the detection of the M184V/I mutation in a prospective study and compared HIV historical genotypes (plasma) versus integrated HIV DNA (PBMCs) obtained via a validated commercial proviral HIV DNA assay. Eligible participants had HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for 6 consecutive months prior to screening. A plasma historical genotypic report (HGR) showing the presence of M184V/I was required for all participants and proviral HIV DNA analysis was conducted prior to enrolment. RESULTS: All 84 participants had evidence of M184V or M184I in their HGR (100%), whereas the mutation was detected in only 40/84 participants by proviral HIV DNA sequencing analysis (48%). Differential detection of M184V/I was not associated with timing differences between the HGR and proviral HIV DNA sampling, the overall duration of ART, or CD4 cell counts and HIV-1 viral load at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that undetected M184V/I should be considered when switching virologically suppressed patients to new regimens, particularly two-drug lamivudine- or emtricitabine-containing combinations.;http://fdslive.oup.com/www.oup.com/pdf/production_in_progress.pdf;8.7;7.7;8.3;;;;;

Such antibodies provide protection against reinfection by the same strain of a pathogen. A highly mutable virus, like HIV or influenza, evades recognition by these strain-specific antibodies via the emergence of new mutant strains. A vaccine that elicits antibodies that can bind to many diverse strains of the virus—known as broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs)—could protect against highly mutable pathogens. Despite much work, the mechanisms by which bnAbs emerge remain uncertain. Using a computational model of affinity maturation, we studied a wide variety of vaccination strategies. Our results suggest that an effective strategy to maximize bnAb evolution is through a sequential immunization protocol, wherein each new immunization optimally increases the pressure on the immune system to target conserved antigenic sites, thus conferring breadth. We describe the mechanisms underlying why sequentially driving the immune system increasingly further from steady state, in an optimal fashion, is effective. The optimal protocol allows many evolving B cells to become bnAbs via diverse evolutionary paths.;http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1919329117;17.1;16.1;15.7;00278424;;;;

The metabolic conversion of nucleoside analogues into their triphosphates often proceeds insufficiently. We developed a nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) delivery system (the TriPPPro approach), in which the -phosphate is covalently modified by two different biodegradable masking units, one is the acyloxybenzyl (AB) moiety and the other is the alkoxycarbonyloxybenzyl (ACB) group. Such compounds formed NTPs with high selectivity by an enzyme-triggered mechanism in human T-lymphocyte CEM cell extracts loosing first the AB moiety, followed by the ACB group. This enables the bypass of all steps of the intracellular phosphorylation. This approach was applied here to convert some modestly active or even inactive nucleoside analogues into powerful biologically active metabolites. Potent antiviral activity profiles were obtained depending on the lipophilicity of the TriPPPro-NTP prodrugs against HIV-1 and HIV-2 replication in cultures of infected wild-type CD4+ CEM T-cells and more importantly in thymidine kinase-deficient CD4+ T-cells (CEM/TK-). This TriPPPro strategy offers high potential for future antiviral and antitumoral chemotherapies.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00358;11.3;10.9;11.3;00222623;;;;

Granulomatous-lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLILD) was classically identified as a non-infectious complication of common variable immunodeficiency; however, it is now being recognized in other immunodeficiency disorders. Here, we report the first case of GLILD accompanied by vacuolar encephalomyelopathy in a newly diagnosed HIV-infected man. Case presentation: A 40-year-old Japanese man presented with chronic dry cough and progressing paraplegia. Radiological examination revealed diffuse pulmonary abnormalities in bilateral lungs, focal demyelinating lesions of the spinal cord, and white matter lesions in the brain. He was diagnosed with GLILD based on marked lymphocytosis detecting in bronchoalveolar lavage, and transbronchial-biopsy proven T-cellular interstitial lung disease with granulomas. Microbiological examinations did not reveal an etiologic agent. The patient was also diagnosed with HIV-associated vacuolar encephalomyelopathy on the basis of an elevated HIV viral load in cerebrospinal fluid. After initiating ART, the brain lesions and paraplegia improved significantly, and interstitial abnormalities of the lungs and cough disappeared. Conclusion: This report highlights that even in the post-ART era in developed countries with advanced healthcare services, HIV-associated vacuolar encephalomyelopathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a progressive neurological disorder during the first visit. Furthermore, GLILD may represent an HIV-associated pulmonary manifestation that can be treated by ART.";https://aidsrestherapy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12981-020-00295-y;3.2;3.8;4.4;;;;;

Prior work suggested a complicated interplay between the cytosolic proteostasis stress response, controlled by the transcriptional master regulator heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). We sought to uncouple HSF1 transcription factor activity from cytotoxic proteostasis stress and thereby better elucidate the proposed role(s) of HSF1 in the HIV-1 lifecycle. To achieve this objective, we used chemical genetic, stress-independent control of HSF1 activity to establish whether and how HSF1 influences HIV-1 replication. Stress-independent HSF1 induction decreased both the total quantity and infectivity of HIV-1 virions. Moreover, HIV-1 was unable to escape HSF1-mediated restriction over the course of several serial passages. These results clarify the interplay between the host's heat shock response and HIV-1 infection and motivate continued investigation of chaperones as potential antiviral therapeutic targets.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00166;4.3;6.0;7.3;;;;;

Our recent study suggests that the cellular protein M-Sec plays a role in these processes. However, the timing, mechanism, and to what extent M-Sec contributes to HIV-1 transmission is not fully understood, and the lack of a cell line model that mimics macrophages has hindered in-depth analysis. Results: We found that HIV-1 increased the number, length and thickness of TNTs in a manner dependent on its pathogenic protein Nef and M-Sec in U87 cells, as observed in macrophages. In addition, we found that M-Sec was required not only for TNT formation but also motility of U87 cells, both of which are beneficial for viral transmission. In fact, M-Sec knockdown in U87 cells led to a significantly delayed viral production in both cellular and extracellular fractions. This inhibition was observed for wild-type virus, but not for a mutant virus lacking Nef, which is known to promote not only TNT formation but also migration of infected macrophages. Conclusions: By taking advantage of useful features of U87 cells, we provided evidence that M-Sec mediates a rapid and efficient cell-cell transmission of HIV-1 at an early phase of infection by enhancing both TNT formation and cell motility.;https://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12977-020-00528-y;7.3;6.7;6.7;;;;;

Methods: All newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases at Beijing YouAn Hospital from January 2012 to December 2013 were selected as the control group, while all newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients from January 2015 to December 2016 were selected as the intervention group, receiving the comprehensive case management model. Results: 4906 patients were enrolled, of which 1549 were in the control group and 3357 in the intervention group. The median time from confirming HIV infection to ART initiation in the intervention group was 35 (18-133) days, much shorter than the control group (56 (26-253) days, P < 0.001). Participants in the intervention group had better ART adherence compared to those in the control group (intervention: 95.3%; control: 89.2%; p < 0.001). During the 2 years' follow-up, those receiving case management were at decreased odds of experiencing virological failure (OR: 0.27, 95%CI: 0.17-0.42, P < 0.001). Observed mortality was 0.4 deaths per 100 patient-years of follow-up for patients in the control group compared with 0.2 deaths per 100 patient-years of follow-up in the intervention group. Conclusions: People living with HIV engaged in the comprehensive case management model were more likely to initiate ART sooner and maintained better treatment compliance and improved clinical outcomes compared to those who received routine care. A comprehensive case management program could be implemented in hospitals across China in order to reduce the HIV disease burden in the country.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05219-9;4.5;4.3;4.1;;;;;

Leprosy–HIV co-infected patients during HAART may present a more severe form of the disease (RR/HIV), but the immune mechanisms related to the pathogenesis of leprosy–HIV co-infection remain unknown. Although the adaptive immune responses have been extensively studied in leprosy–HIV co-infected individuals, recent studies have described that innate immune cells may drive the overall immune responses to mycobacterial antigens. Monocytes are critical to the innate immune system and play an important role in several inflammatory conditions associated with chronic infections. In leprosy, different tissue macrophage phenotypes have been associated with the different clinical forms of the disease, but it is not clear how HIV infection modulates the phenotype of innate immune cells (monocytes or macrophages) during leprosy. In the present study, we investigated the phenotype of monocytes and macrophages in leprosy–HIV co-infected individuals, with or without RR. We did not observe differences between the monocyte profiles in the studied groups; however, analysis of gene expression within the skin lesion cells revealed that the RR/HIV group presents a higher expression of macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MRS1), CD209 molecule (CD209), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), arginase 2 (ARG2), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) when compared with the RR group. Our data suggest that different phenotypes of tissue macrophages found in the skin from RR and RR/HIV patients could differentially contribute to the progression of leprosy.";https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01493/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;;;;

The number of patients affected with HAND ranges from 30 to 50% of HIV infected individuals and although the development of combinational antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved longevity, HAND continues to pose a significant clinical problem as the current standard of care does not alleviate or prevent HAND symptoms. At present, the pathological mechanisms contributing to HAND remain unclear, but evidence suggests that it stems from neuronal injury due to chronic release of neurotoxins, chemokines, viral proteins, and proinflammatory cytokines secreted by HIV-1 activated microglia, macrophages and astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) not only serves as a route for HIV-1 entry into the brain but also prevents cART therapy from reaching HIV-1 brain reservoirs, and therefore could play an important role in HAND. The goal of this review is to discuss the current data on the epidemiology, pathology and research models of HAND as well as address the potential pharmacological treatment approaches that are being investigated.;https://fluidsbarrierscns.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12987-020-00204-5;7.1;5.9;6.0;;;;;

We propose a parametric nonlinear mixed effects model for the viral rebound trajectory, which often has a rapid rise to a peak value followed by a decrease to a viral load set point. We choose a flexible functional form that captures the shapes of viral rebound trajectories and can also provide biological insights regarding the rebound process. Each parameter can incorporate a random effect to allow for variation in parameters across individuals. Key features of viral rebound trajectories such as viral set points are represented by the parameters in the model, which facilitates assessment of intervention effects and identification of important pretreatment interruption predictors for these features. We employ a stochastic expectation-maximization (StEM) algorithm to incorporate HIV-1 RNA values that are below the lower limit of assay quantification. We evaluate the performance of our model in simulation studies and apply the proposed model to longitudinal HIV-1 viral load data from five AIDS Clinical Trials Group treatment interruption studies.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.8529;3.4;3.4;3.3;02776715;;;;

This study aimed to identify biomarker predictors of frailty in HIV-infected patients. Methods: A cross-sectional study of HIV-infected patients who had been on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least 1 year and who presented an undetectable viral load (< 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) at baseline was carried out. For each frail patient, up to four pre-frail and robust patients were randomly selected. The frailty status assessment was based on the five-item criteria described by Fried et al. Sociodemographic, anthropometric, biochemical and HIV-related characteristics were evaluated. Multiple potential biomarkers of frailty and a biological age biomarker were analysed. Results: A total of 73 HIV-infected patients on ART for at least 1 year were evaluated. The patients were categorized as robust (n = 33), pre-frail (n = 32) and frail (n = 8) using the Fried criteria. All patients were on ART, with 100% undetectable viral load (< 50 copies/mL) at baseline. No significant differences in demographic, clinical or analytical characteristics were observed among patients in the different categories based on Fried criteria, with the exception of the veterans aging cohort study index (VACS). Similarly, no differences were observed in HIV-related characteristics, although nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) use was less common in frail persons. The distribution of biomarker values varied according to frailty status, with frail persons having higher levels of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-18, CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4). In multivariable analysis, the assocation of frailty with RBP4 showed a tendency to statistical significance (odds ratio 1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.99–1.00; P < 0.05). Conclusions: Differential biomarker expression was present according to Fried status. Longitudinal studies will clarify the utility of these biomarkers as targets for diagnostic or therapeutic intervention.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hiv.12837;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;;

This protein is proteolytically cleaved by HIV-1 protease (PR) to finally generate a mature RT that is a heterodimer, composed of a p66 subunit and a p66-derived 51 kDa subunit, p51. In our prior work, we demonstrated that tRNALys3 binding to p66/p66 facilitates efficient cleavage of p66 to p51 by PR. However, tRNALys3 is known to be recruited to the virus by forming a complex with lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS). Herein, we tested whether LysRS can have an effect on RT maturation in vitro. Importantly, our data show no significant differences in RT maturation in the presence of LysRS. Furthermore, no apparent p66/66 interaction with LysRS was observed. Although PR cleaved LysRS, it did not immediately release tRNALys3 from LysRS. Thus, we conclude that a free fraction of tRNALys3, which is in equilibrium with a LysRS-bound form, interacts with p66/p66 without any additional mechanism involving release of tRNALys3 from LysRS. Given that only transient tRNALys3-p66/p66 interaction is needed for efficient RT maturation, a small amount of free tRNA may be sufficient for this process. These studies reveal molecular level insights into RT maturation and will be useful for the design of cellular/viral experiments to better understand the role of tRNA in HIV-1 replication.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.0c01449;0.7;1.4;2.7;;;;;

However, the mechanism(s) by which inflammation facilitates infection is not fully understood. In rhesus macaques challenged with simian immunodeficiency virus, dendritic cell (DC) mediated recruitment of CD4+ T cells to the FGT was critical for infection. The aim of this study was to delineate the mechanisms underlying DC-mediated HIV infection by comparing chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to transmitted founder (TF) and chronic infection (CI) Envelope (Env) pseudotyped viruses (PSV). Results: Monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) were stimulated with PSV and recombinant gp140 representing matched TF and CI pairs of four individuals and cytokine secretion measured by multiplex immuno-assay. We found that 4/9 Env induced robust MDDC inflammatory responses and of those, three were cloned from TFs. Overall, TF Env induced MDDCs from healthy donors to secrete higher concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines than those from CI, suggesting TF Env were better inducers of inflammation. Assessing the signalling pathway associated with inflammatory cytokines, we found that PSV of matched TF and CI variants and a gp140 clone activated ERK and JNK to similar levels. Recombinant soluble DC-SIGN inhibited cytokine release and activation of ERK by PSV, suggesting that Env-DC-SIGN binding was partly involved in MDDC stimulation. Therefore, Env clones might differentially stimulate MDDC immune responses via alternative, yet unidentified signalling pathways. Conclusion: Overall, this could suggest that the genetics of the virus itself influences inflammatory responses during HIV infection. In the absence of pre-existing infections, induction of greater inflammatory response by TFs might favour virus survival within the healthy FGT by driving an influx of target cells to sites of infection while suppressing immune responses via IL-10.;https://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12977-020-00526-0;7.3;6.7;6.7;;;;;

We demonstrate a novel publicly available modeling tool (teen-SPARC) to help state and local health departments predict the impact of behavioral change on gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV burden among adolescents. Methods: Teen-SPARC is built in Excel for familiarity and ease and parameterized using data from CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. We present teen-SPARC's methods, including derivation of national parameters and instructions to obtain local parameters. We model multiple scenarios of increasing condom use and estimate the impact on gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV incidence, comparing national and New York State (NYS) results. Results: A 1% annual increase in condom use (consistent with Healthy People 2020 goals) could prevent nearly 10,000 cases of STIs nationwide. Increases in condom use of 17.1%, 2.2%, and 25.5% in NYS would be necessary to avert 1000 cases of gonorrhea, 1000 cases of chlamydia, and 10 cases of HIV infection, respectively. Additional results disaggregate outcomes by age, sex, partner sex, jurisdiction, and pathogen.

The virus enters the central nervous system (CNS) early in infection and continues to cause HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The pathogenic mechanisms of HIV-associated brain injury remain incompletely understood. Since HIV-1 activates the type I interferon system, which signals via interferon- receptor (IFNAR) 1 and 2, this study investigated the potential role of IFNAR1 in HIV-induced neurotoxicity. Methods: We cross-bred HIVgp120-transgenic (tg) and IFNAR1 knockout (IFNAR1KO) mice. At 11-14 months of age, we performed a behavioral assessment and subsequently analyzed neuropathological alterations using deconvolution and quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy, quantitative RT-PCR, and bioinformatics. Western blotting of brain lysates and an in vitro neurotoxicity assay were employed for analysis of cellular signaling pathways. Results: We show that IFNAR1KO results in partial, sex-dependent protection from neuronal injury and behavioral deficits in a transgenic model of HIV-induced brain injury. The IFNAR1KO rescues spatial memory and ameliorates loss of presynaptic terminals preferentially in female HIVgp120tg mice. Similarly, expression of genes involved in neurotransmission reveals sex-dependent effects of IFNAR1KO and HIVgp120. In contrast, IFNAR1-deficiency, independent of sex, limits damage to neuronal dendrites, microgliosis, and activation of p38 MAPK and restores ERK activity in the HIVgp120tg brain. In vitro, inhibition of p38 MAPK abrogates neurotoxicity caused similarly by blockade of ERK kinase and HIVgp120. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that IFNAR1 plays a pivotal role in both sex-dependent and independent processes of neuronal injury and behavioral impairment triggered by HIV-1.;https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-020-01894-2;8.4;8.4;9.4;;;;;

Brain monocyte-derived macrophages can induce HIV neurocognitive disorders (HAND) by releasing neurotoxic factors. One of these secreted factors is cathepsin B (CATB), a lysosomal cysteine protease that interacts with serum amyloid P component (SAPC) contributing to HIV-induced neurotoxicity. However, the mechanisms that trigger CATB and SAPC neuronal apoptosis remain unknown. We aimed to elucidate intracellular pathways in neurons exposed to HIV-infected macrophage supernatants after inhibition of CATB or SAPC with specific antibodies and with the cathepsin B inhibitor CA074 using Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) quantitative proteomics and Ingenuity pathways analyses. Based on significant fold change (FC) > |2|and p-value < 0.05 criteria a total of 10, 13, and 48 proteins were deregulated after CATB antibody, SAPC antibody, and CA074 treatment, respectively. Antibodies against CATB and SAPC downregulated two common apoptosis related proteins: Cyclophilin A (CYPA) and Tubulin alpha-1A (TUBA1). CATB, SAPC antibodies and CA074 downregulated a common protein TUBA1A. Quantitative proteomics analyses revealed that treatment of HIV-infected MDM supernatants with antibodies against CATB/SAPC or with CA074 can reverse common and unique apoptotic pathways that deserve further studies as potential targets against HIV-induced neuronal degeneration.;None;2.4;3.0;1.2;;;;;

Along with CD4+ T cells, HIV-1 targets macrophages which may contribute to viral spreading and the latent reservoir. We have studied the relationship between macrophages and HIV-2, focusing on post-entry steps. HIV-2-infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) produced substantial amounts of viral particles that were largely harbored intracellularly. New viruses assembled at the limiting membrane of internal compartments similar to virus-containing compartments (VCCs) described for HIV-1. VCCs from MDMs infected with either virus shared protein composition and morphology. Strikingly, HIV-2 Gag was mostly absent from the cytosol and almost exclusively localized to the VCCs, whereas HIV-1 Gag was distributed in both locations. Ultrastructural analyses of HIV-2-infected MDMs revealed the presence of numerous VCCs containing both immature and mature particles in the lumen. HIV-2 particles produced de novo by MDMs were poorly infectious in reporter cells and in transmission to activated T cells through a process that appeared independent of BST2 restriction. Rather than being involved in viral spreading, HIV-2-infected macrophages may represent a cell-associated source of viral antigens that can participate in the immune control of HIV-2 infection.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01603/full;5.0;5.6;6.4;;;;;

Methods: A total of 540 samples of newly reported HIV-1 positive MSM were consecutively collected in Kunming from 2016 to 2018, the pol gene fragments were amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HIV-1 molecular networks were constructed according to the bootstrap value of the maximum likelihood evolutionary tree over 95% and the genetic distance less than 3%. The factors associated with the subjects entering network and network growth were further analyzed. Results: Among 459 successfully sequenced samples, seven genotypes were found, in which CRF07_BC (49.2%, 226/459) and CRF01_AE (40.3%, 185/459 ) were predominant. Other genotypes included URFs (4.8%, 22/459), CRF08_BC (3.1%, 14/459), CRF55_01B (1.7%, 8/459), B (0.7%, 3/459) and CRF68_01B (0.2%, 1/459). A total of 163 sequences entered the network, with an entry rate of 35.5%(163/459), forming 56 clusters with the number of individuals in the cluster was between 2 and 13. The analysis of the factors associated with entering network showed that the MSM who married and had multiple homosexual partners were more likely to be found in HIV-1 molecular networks. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the number of sexual partners was the factor for the growth of HIV-1 molecular network. According to the criteria for the emergence of three or more newly reported cases in every year, six transmission clusters were judged as active transmission clusters, in which MSM who were not Kunming natives, had sexually transmitted diseases (STD), were divorced and students were the key targets of intervention. Conclusions: HIV-1 genotypes in MSM in Kunming were becoming complex, the risk factors associated with transmission networks in MSM in Kunming included being married and having multiple partners, the intervention targets in active transmission clusters included MSM who were not Kunming natives, had STD, were divorced and students. This study provided the basis for applying HIV-1 molecular networks to real-time intervention in this population.;http://journal.yiigle.com/LinkIn.do?linkin_type=DOI&DOI=10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20190916-00676;0.8;0;0;02546450;;;;

We have recently found several benzotriazole and benzotriazine analogues that have the ability to reactivate latent HIV by inhibiting signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) SUMOylation and promoting STAT5 binding to the HIV long terminal repeat and increasing its transcriptional activity. To understand the essential structural groups required for biological activity of these molecules, we performed a systematic analysis of >40 analogues. First, we characterized the essential motifs within these molecules that are required for their biological activity. Second, we identified three benzotriazine analogues with similar activity. We demonstrated that these three compounds are able to increase STAT5 phosphorylation and transcriptional activity. All active analogues reactivate latent HIV in a primary cell model of latency and enhance the ability of interleukin-15 to reactivate latent HIV in cells isolated from aviremic participants. Third, this family of compounds also promote immune effector functions in vitro in the absence of toxicity or global immune activation. Finally, initial studies in mice suggest lack of acute toxicity in vivo. A better understanding of the biological activity of these compounds will help in the design of improved LRAs that work via inhibition of STAT5 SUMOylation.";https://aac.asm.org/content/64/8/e00888-20;7.8;7.9;8.3;00664804;;;;

Methods: PROMISE was a large multi-national randomized controlled trial of the safety and efficacy of interventions to reduce perinatal transmission of HIV-1 (HIV) during pregnancy and breastfeeding and of interventions to preserve maternal health after cessation of perinatal transmission risk. The PROMISE study included two protocols for HIV-infected pregnant women in resource-limited countries who intended to either breastfeed or formula-feed their infants and did not meet country criteria for antiretroviral treatment. The PROMISE breastfeeding protocol (1077BF) used a sequential randomization design with up to three randomizations (Antepartum, Postpartum, and Maternal Health). The PROMISE formula-feeding protocol (1077FF) had two randomizations (Antepartum and Maternal Health). Women presenting to the clinic during early or active labor or in the immediate postpartum period were registered as Late Presenters and screened to determine whether eligible to participate in the Postpartum randomization. Results: The study was conducted at 14 sites in seven countries and opened to enrollment in April 2011. A total of 3259 pregnant women intending to breastfeed and an additional 284 pregnant women intending to formula feed were randomized in the Antepartum component. A total of 204 Late Presenters were registered during labor or after delivery. Enrollment was high among breastfeeding women (representing 96% of the target of 3400 women) but was lower than expected among women intending to formula feed (28% of 1000 expected) and late-presenting women (8% of 2500 expected). The successful overall enrollment and final primary study analyses results were attributed to substantial preparation before the study opened, collaboration among all stakeholders, close study monitoring during implementation and the flexibility to change and streamline the protocol. Conclusions: Experiences from the PROMISE study illustrate the challenges of enrolling in longer term studies in the setting of rapidly evolving prevention and treatment standards priorities. The lessons learned will help the community, site investigators, and study coordinators in the design and implementation of future clinical trials.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1740774520912428;4.6;4.4;4.3;17407745;;;;

It is also considered as a promising therapeutic target for HIV-1 infection. Despite its role in HIV acquisition and disease progression, HIV-1-mediated integrin 47 signaling has not been elucidated so far. In view of this, we determined phosphoproteomic signatures of HIV-1 gp120 signaling as well as signaling mediated by the integrin 47 ligand, mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), in primary CD4+ T cells. This is the first comprehensive report on MAdCAM-1 signaling, which is believed to enhance HIV-1 replication. Importantly, we identified proteins associated with both classical and nonclassical integrin functions. We observed that HIV-1 gp120 signaling is associated with proteins that have previously not been associated with HIV-1 pathogenesis and thus, need to be explored further. There was a significant overlap in proteins identified by both MAdCAM-1 and HIV-1 gp120 signaling, which most likely represents cellular processes triggered upon interaction of HIV-1 gp120 with integrin 47. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of processes that could facilitate viral replication as well as viral entry through endocytosis. Although these results warrant independent replication and further validation, they suggest the presence of additional potential therapeutic targets. These results also suggest that combinatorial approaches for targeting both HIV-1 gp120 and MAdCAM-1 signaling may be necessary for efficient control of HIV-1 infection as well as novel innovation strategies in HIV therapeutics.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/omi.2019.0196;4.6;4.5;4.8;15362310;;;;

National guidelines endorse provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling (PITC) to increase testing coverage, but PITC is rarely provided in Sierra Leone. In response, a Quality Improvement Collaborative (QIC) was implemented to improve PITC coverage amongst adult inpatients. Methods: Ten hospitals received the intervention between October 2017 and August 2018; there were no control facilites. Each hospital aimed to improve PITC coverage to  95% of eligible patients. Staff received training on PITC and QIC methods and a package of PITC best practices and tools. They then worked to identify additional contextually-appropriate interventions, conducted rapid tests of change, and tracked performance using shared indicators and time-series data. Supportive supervision bolstered QI skills, and quarterly meetings enabled diffusion of innovations while spurring friendly competition. Results: Baseline PITC coverage was 4%. The hospital teams tested diverse interventions using QI methods, including staff training; data review meetings; enhanced workflow processes and supervision; and patient education and sensitization activities Nine hospitals reached and sustained the 95% target, and all saw rapid and durable improvement, which was sustained for a median of six months. Of the 5,238 patients tested for HIV, 311 (6%) were found to be HIV-positive and were referred for treatment. HIV rapid test kit stockouts occurred during the project period, limiting PITC services in some cases. Conclusions: The intervention led to swift and sustained improvement in inpatient PITC coverage and to the diagnosis of hundreds of people living with HIV.

Our objective was to analyze the post-transmission mutations associated with escape to the cytotoxic immune response and its relationship with the progression of the infection. In this study, a total of 17 patients were enrolled during acute/early primary HIV infection and 8 subjects that were the HIV positive partner resulting in 8 transmission pairs. Genotyping of the genetic polymorphisms of HLA class I A and B was performed using PCR-SSOP. Viral RNA extraction was from plasma. 570 single Gag-gene amplifications were obtained by limiting-dilution RT-PCR. Epitope prediction was performed with NetMHC CBS prediction server for the 19 HLA-A and [sbnd]B alleles. Cytotoxic response prediction was performed by using the IEDB Analysis Resource. From our results, we deduce that the transmitted CTL / gag escape frequency in the founder virus was at least double compared to the post-transmission events. Additionally, by means of an algorithm that combines these frequencies, we observed that the founder viruses better adapted to the HLA A / B alleles of the recipient could contribute to a greater progression of the infection. Our results suggest that there is a large adaptation of HIV-1 to the HLA A / B alleles prevalent in our population. However, despite this adaptive advantage, the virus needs to make “readjustments” through new escape and compensatory mutations. Interestingly, according to our results, this readaptation could have a role in the progression of the infection.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567134820300393;5.2;4.9;5.0;15671348;S1567134820300393;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1567134820300393;;

Young adults with perinatally acquired HIV (YPHIVs) living in the United States are transitioning to adult clinical care, yet there is little information on factors that affect transition outcomes. Methods. YPHIVs aged =18 years in the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) AMP Up cohort approaching or having completed transition from pediatric to adult healthcare were included. Demographic and clinical characteristics and self-reported ability to self-manage healthcare were compared by transition status, and multivariable logistic regression models examined factors associated with satisfaction with, and retention in, adult clinical care (clinic visit within the previous 6 months). Results. Most of the 455 YPHIVs, regardless of transition status, reported satisfaction with their clinic and care provider, but many reported antiretroviral medication nonadherence. Of the 124 YPHIVs who had transitioned, 56% had periods of unsuppressed HIV-1 RNA in the year before transition. Those who had transitioned were more likely to report high ability to self-manage their healthcare (ability to manage =7 of 8 skills) than those not transitioned. High self-management was associated with retention after transition (odds ratio, 3.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.33-9.12). Higher perceived emotional social support was also associated with retention. Older age at transition was associated with greater satisfaction with provider and clinic. Conclusions. YPHIVs have positive associations with their clinical care around the time of their transition to adult care, but unsuppressed viral load and suboptimal adherence are a concern. Strengthening skills that increase ability to self-manage care and enhance social support may increase retention in care and improve clinical health.";https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/1/133/5550320;14.0;13.8;12.5;10584838;;;;

HIV Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British HIV AssociationIntroduction: There is limited literature on the appropriateness of viral load (VL) monitoring and management of detectable VL in public health settings in rural South Africa. Methods: We analysed data captured in the electronic patient register from HIV-positive patients  15 years old initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 17 public sector clinics in rural KwaZulu-Natal, during 2010–2016. We estimated the completion rate for VL monitoring at 6, 12, and 24 months. We described the cascade of care for those with any VL measurement  1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL after  20 weeks on ART, including the following proportions: (1) repeat VL within 6 months; (2) re-suppressed; (3) switched to second-line regimen. Results: There were 29 384 individuals who initiated ART during the period [69% female, median age 31 years (interquartile range 25–39)]. Of those in care at 6, 12, and 24 months, 40.7% (9861/24 199), 34% (7765/22 807), and 25.5% (4334/16 965) had a VL test at each recommended time-point, respectively. The VL results were documented at all recommended time-points for 12% (2730/22 807) and 6.2% (1054/16 965) of ART-treated patients for 12 and 24 months, respectively. Only 391 (18.3%) of 2135 individuals with VL  1000 copies/mL on first-line ART had a repeat VL documenting re-suppression or were appropriately changed to second-line with persistent failure. Completion of the treatment failure cascade occurred a median of 338 days after failure was detected. Conclusion: We found suboptimal VL monitoring and poor responses to virologic failure in public-sector ART clinics in rural South Arica.

By interacting with cellular receptors, the Env protein complex initiates the infectious cycle of HIV. After the first contact has been established Env disassembles by shedding gp120 while the remaining gp41 undergoes a number of conformational changes which drive fusion of the cellular and the viral membranes. Here we investigated the membrane interactions and oligomerization of the two gp41 heptad repeat domains NHR and CHR. While these are thought to form a six-helix bundle in the post-fusion state little is known about their structure and role during prior fusion events. When investigated in aqueous buffer by CD and fluorescence quenching techniques the formation of NHR/CHR hetero-oligomers is detected. An equilibrium of monomers and hetero-oligomers is also observed in membrane environments. Furthermore, the partitioning to POPC or POPC/POPG 3/1 vesicles of the two domains alone or in combination has been studied. The membrane interactions were further characterized by 15N solid-state NMR spectroscopy of uniaxially oriented samples which shows that the polypeptide helices are oriented parallel to the bilayer surface.

Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) needs the HIV-1 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) for its replication. Therefore, both HIV-1 PR and RT are important targets for antiretroviral drug development. Experimental procedure: The crude hexane (LRH), ethanol (LRE) and water (LRW) extracts of LR were in vitro screened for inhibitory activity against HIV-1 PR and RT, then anti-HIV-1 activity on the infected MOLT-4 cells were determined. Chemical constituents of the extracts were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography (LC)-MS. The identified compounds were in silico analysed for drug-likeness property and molecular modelling. Results and conclusion: According to our screening assays, LRE and LRW significantly inhibited both enzymes (25–55%), while LRH suppressed only the HIV-1 PR activity (88.97%). At 0.5 mg/ml of LRW showed significant inhibition of HIV-1 induced syncytial formation and p24 production in the infected MOLT-4 cells. Investigation of chemical analysis revealed that major groups of identified constituents found in the extracts were fatty acids, peptides and terpenoids. In silico analysis showed that heliantriol F and 6 alpha-fluoroprogesterone displayed great binding energies with HIV-1 PR and HIV-1 RT, respectively. These findings suggest that LR could be a potential source of compounds to inhibit HIV-1 PR and/or RT activities in vitro. Furthermore, our results provide beneficial data for the development of novel HIV-1 PR and RT inhibitors.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2225411019303542;3.9;4.9;6.5;;S2225411019303542;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2225411019303542;;

While KSHV is clearly the etiologic agent of KS, the mechanisms underlying KS development are not fully understood. For example, HIV-1 co-infection and concomitant immune dysfunction have been associated with EpKS development. However, the direct or indirect role(s) of HIV-1, and therefore of immune suppression, in EpKS remains unclear. How, or whether, EpKS is mechanistically distinct from EnKS is unknown. Thus, the absence of HIV- 1 co-infection in EnKS provides a unique control for investigating and deciphering whether HIV-1 plays a direct or indirect role in the EpKS tumor microenvironment. We hypothesized that HIV-1 co-infection would induce transcriptome changes that differentiate EpKS from EnKS, thereby defining the direct intra-tumor role of HIV-1 in KS. Comparison of ARTtreated and -naïve patients would further define the impact of ART on the KS transcriptome. We utilized RNA-seq followed by multiparameter bioinformatics analysis to compare transcriptomes from KS lesions to uninvolved control skin. We provide the first transcriptomic comparison of EpKS versus EnKS, ART-treated vs-naïve EpKS and male vs female EpKS to define the roles of HIV-1 co-infection, the impact of ART, and gender on KS gene expression profiles. Our findings suggest that ART-use and gender have minimal impact on transcriptome profiles of KS lesions. Gene expression profiles strongly correlated between EpKS and EnKS patients (Spearman r = 0.83, p<10-10). A subset of genes involved in tumorigenesis and inflammation/immune responses showed higher magnitude, but not unique dysregulation in EnKS compared to EpKS. While gender and ART had no detectable contribution, the trend toward higher magnitude of gene dysregulation in EnKS coupled with the absence of HIV-1 transcripts in EpKS may suggest an indirect or systemic effect of HIV- 1 to promote KS tumorigenesis.

DESIGN: PBMC were obtained from six patients who had been HIV---infected for over 20 years and were on ART for 1---12 years prior to this study. METHODS: The PBMC were derived into iPSCs and genetically edited with TALENs or CRISPR---cas9 endonucleases combined with PiggyBac technology to introduce the naturally occurring 32---bp deletion to the CCR5 gene. These iPSCs were differentiated into macrophages, and subsequently challenged with CCR5---tropic or CCR5/CXCR4 dual--- tropic HIV---1 strains. iPSC derivation, gene editing and immune cell differentiation were done in feeder---free, xeno---free in-vitro conditions. RESULTS: Multiple unedited (wild---type) and CCR5 gene---edited (mutant) iPSCs were derived from patients' PBMC. When differentiated into immune cells and HIV---1 challenged, mutant iPSC lines were resistant to CCR5---tropic and to some extent to CCR5/CXCR4 dual---tropic HIV---1 infection when compared to wild---type iPSC lines. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that iPSC---derived, gene---edited immune cells are resistant to distinct HIV---1 strains.

One factor determining the fate of dUMP in proviral DNA is the host cell uracil base excision repair (UBER) system. Here we explore the relative UBER capacity of monocytes (MC) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and the fate of integrated uracilated viruses in both cell types to understand the implications of viral dUMP on HIV diversification and infectivity. We find that the kinetics for MC infection is compatible with their lifetime in vivo and their near absence of hUNG2 activity is consistent with the retention of viral dUMP at high levels at least until differentiation into macrophages, where UBER becomes possible. Overexpression of human uracil DNA glycosylase in MDM prior to infection resulted in rapid removal of dUMP from HIV cDNA and near complete depletion of dUMP-containing viral copies. This finding establishes that the low hUNG2 expression level in these cells limits UBER but that hUNG2 is restrictive against uracilated viruses. In contrast, overexpression of hUNG2 after viral integration did not accelerate the excision of uracils, suggesting that they may poorly accessible in the context of chromatin. We found that viral DNA molecules with incorporated dUMP contained unique (+) strand transversion mutations that were not observed when dUMP was absent (G!T, T!A, T!G, A!C). These observations and other considerations suggest that dUMP introduces errors predominantly during (-) strand synthesis when the template is RNA. Overall, the likelihood of producing a functional virus from in vitro infection of MC is about 50-fold and 300-fold reduced as compared to MDM and activated T cells. The results implicate viral dUMP incorporation in MC and MDM as a potential viral diversification and restriction pathway during human HIV infection.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235012;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

In contrast to CD4+ T cells, HIV-M are resistant to the cytopathic effects of acute HIV infection and have increased expression of cell survival factors, including X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), baculoviral IAP repeat containing (BIRC) 2/cIAP1, beclin-1, BCL2, BCL-xl, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1, mitofusin (MFN) 1, and MFN2. DIABLO/SMAC mimetics are therapeutic agents that affect cancer cell survival and induce cell death. We found that DIABLO/SMAC mimetics (LCL-161, AT-406 (also known as SM-406 or Debio 1143), and birinapant) selectively kill HIV-M without increasing bystander cell death. DIABLO/SMAC mimetic treatment of HIV-M-induced XIAP and BIRC2 degradation, leading to the induction of autophagy and the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex on phagophore membranes that includes both pro-apoptotic or necroptotic (FADD, receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 1, RIPK3, caspase 8, and MLKL) and autophagy (ATG5, ATG7, and SQSTM1) proteins. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of early stages of autophagy, but not late stages of autophagy, ablated this interaction and inhibited apoptosis. Furthermore, DIABLO/SMAC mimetic-mediated apoptosis of HIV-M is dependent upon tumor necrosis factor signaling. Our findings thus demonstrate that DIABLO/SMAC mimetics selectively induce autophagy-dependent apoptosis in HIV-M.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-020-02761-x;9.4;6.8;8.0;;;;;

Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.Background. Coinfection with human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is associated with shorter survival for adults and children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), although the reasons remain a matter of debate. We evaluated the factors associated with survival time in a large cohort of HIV/HTLV-1-coinfected and HIV-monoinfected individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Methods. In a nested, retrospective case-control study (1:1), we reviewed medical records of people with HIV infection on cART in a referral AIDS center in Salvador, Brazil. We matched 149 patients coinfected with HTLV-1 (cases) by age at HIV diagnosis and sex, to an equal number of HTLV-uninfected persons (controls). Death rates, survival time, baseline and current CD4 cell count, last HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load (pVL), and causes of death were compared between groups. Results. The overall mortality rate was 2.1 person-years (76 deaths, 53 among coinfected patients). Survival time for cases (16.7 ± 0.7 years) was significantly shorter than for controls (18.1 ± 0.4 years; P =.001). Among patients with pVL >50 copies/mL, coinfected patients had a shorter survival time (8.4 ± 0.8 years) than monoinfected ones (12.9 ± 1.4 years; P =.02), regardless of pVL magnitude. However, survival time did not differ for HIV-monoinfected (19.0 ± 0.4 years) or coinfected patients (20.2 ± 0.6 years) presenting with pVL <50 copies/mL (P =.5). Deceased coinfected patients had higher initial CD4 count (417 ± 219 cells) than monoinfected ones with the same outcome (177 ± 160 cells; P =.004), while survivors had similar CD4 cell count at baseline, regardless of HTLV status. Conclusions. Successful cART is able to normalize survival for coinfected patients and should be introduced for all coinfected patients, regardless of CD4 cell count.";https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/1/196/5549137;14.0;13.8;12.5;10584838;;;;

However, other HIV+ individuals could naturally also harbour low viral reservoirs. Methods: We screened 451 HIV-1-infected treated-individuals with suppressed plasma viremia for at least 3 years and stored cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Total HIV-DNA was analysed in PBMCs with ddPCR. Individuals with <50 HIV-DNA copies/106 PBMCs constitute the ‘Low Viral Reservoir Treated’ cohort (LoViReT). Longitudinal samples were obtained from 12 chronically treated LoViReT and compared to 13 controls (>50 HIV-DNA copies/106 PBMCs) to analyse total HIV-DNA, T-cell and NK-cell populations, HIV-1 specific antibodies, and plasma inflammation markers. Findings: We found that 9.3% of the individuals screened had <50 HIV-DNA copies/106 PBMCs. At least 66% initiated cART during the chronic phase of HIV-1 infection (cp-LoViReT). Cp-LoViReT harboured lower levels of HIV-DNA before cART and after treatment introduction the decays were greater compared to controls. They displayed a marked decline in quantity and avidity in HIV-specific antibodies after initiation of cART. Cp-LoViReT had fewer CD8+ TTM and TEMRA in the absence of cART, and higher CD8+ TN after 18 months on therapy. Interpretation: Treated chronically HIV-1-infected LoViReT represent a new phenotype of individuals characterized by an intrinsically reduced viral reservoir, less impaired CD8+ T-cell compartment before cART, and low circulating HIV-1 antigens despite being treated in the chronic phase of infection. The identification of this unique group of individuals is of great interest for the design of future eradication studies.

Design A population-based study using key informant methodology (KIM) was conducted as part of a clinical research trial. Children aged 4-15 years were clinically assessed for CP. Results The estimated prevalence of CP using KIM was 2.3/1000 children (95% CI 2.0 to 2.5/1000). 388 children were diagnosed with CP, with Gross Motor Function Classification System level 1 in 70 (18.1%), II in 156 (40.2%), III in 54 (13.9%), IV in 54 (13.9%), V in 54 (13.9%). 300/388 (77.3%) had Manual Ability Classification Scale of level 1-3 and 88 (22.7%) of level 4-5. CP types were spastic in 271 (70%), with 60% of these bilateral and 40% unilateral, ataxic 38 (9.8%), dystonic 18 (4.6%), choreoathetoid 29 (7.5%) and unclassifiable 32 (8.3%). Postneonatal risk factors for CP were seen in 140 (36.1%) children including malaria with seizures 101/140 (72.1%), malaria with coma 21/140 (15.0%), meningitis 12/140 (8.6%), tuberculosis 2/140 (1.4%), sickle cell disease 3/140 (2.2%), HIV 1/221 (0.7%). Prenatal/perinatal risk factors were seen in 248 (63.9%%), birth asphyxia 118 (47.6%) and clinical congenital rubella syndrome 8 (3.3%) and hyperbilirubinaemia 59 (23.8%) were identified as preventable risk factors for CP. Conclusion The profile of CP in this population is similar to that found in other low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC). Some risk factors identified were preventable. Prevention and management strategies for CP designed for LMIC are needed.;https://adc.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/archdischild-2019-317932;5.3;5.5;4.7;00039888;;;;

DESIGN: HIV-1 antibody and HIV-1 DNA levels were measured in blood specimens from 61 children and adolescents from the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study: Adolescent Master Protocol. Twenty perinatally HIV-1-exposed, uninfected children studied through 2 years served as controls. METHODS: HIV-1 IgG antibodies to six HIV-1 proteins were measured by quantitative ELISA; HIV-1 DNA levels were measured by droplet digital PCR. RESULTS: Among 13 children with viral suppression at less than 1 year, antibodies to gp160 and gp41 were low but stable longitudinally; antibodies to p17, p24, and RT decreased, and antibodies to p31 were low or undetectable. Among 48 children with viral suppression between 1 and 5 years, antibody levels to all six HIV-1 proteins were higher than in children with earlier viral suppression and remained high over time. A receiver operator curve approach identified gp41 and gp160 as useful predictors of HIV-1 DNA less than 10 or less than 100 copies per million PBMC (cpm); C-statistics including all antibodies ranged from 0.75 to 0.77.

All Rights Reserved.HIV-1 successfully establishes long-term infection in its target cells despite viral cytotoxic effects. We have recently shown that cell metabolism is an important factor driving CD4+ T cell susceptibility to HIV-1 and the survival of infected cells. We show here that expression of antiapoptotic clone 11 (AAC-11), an antiapoptotic factor upregulated in many cancers, increased with progressive CD4+ T cell memory differentiation in association with the expression of cell cycle, activation, and metabolism genes and was correlated with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Synthetic peptides based on the LZ domain sequence of AAC-11, responsible for its interaction with molecular partners, were previously shown to be cytotoxic to cancer cells. Here, we observed that these peptides also blocked HIV-1 infection by inducing the death of HIV-1-susceptible primary CD4+ T cells across all T cell subsets. The peptides targeted metabolically active cells and had the greatest effect on effector and transitional CD4+ T cell memory subsets. Our results suggest that the AAC-11 survival pathway is potentially involved in the survival of HIV-1-infectible cells and provide proof of principle that some cellular characteristics can be targeted to eliminate the cells offering the best conditions to sustain HIV-1 replication. IMPORTANCE Although antiretroviral treatment efficiently blocks HIV multiplication, it cannot eliminate cells already carrying integrated proviruses. In the search for an HIV cure, the identification of new potential targets to selectively eliminate infected cells is of the outmost importance. We show here that peptides derived from antiapoptotic clone 11 (AAC-11), whose expression levels correlated with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells, induced cytotoxicity in CD4+ T cells showing the highest levels of activation and metabolic activity, conditions known to favor HIV-1 infection. Accordingly, CD4+ T cells that survived the cytotoxic action of the AAC-11 peptides were resistant to HIV-1 replication. Our results identify a new potential molecular pathway to target HIV-1 infection.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/14/e00611-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

In this study, 83 HIV-positive MSM infections were confirmed at a sentinel surveillance site in Xi'an city, China in 2018. HIV-1 genotypes were determined by phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 gag, pol and env gene fragments, including CRF07_BC (51.8%), CRF01_AE (30.1%), subtype B (3.6%), CRF55_01B (3.6%), CRF104_0107 (1.2%) and unique recombinant forms (URFs) (9.6%). Transmitted drug resistance mutations were detected in 2.4% (2/82) of HIV-infected MSM individuals. The phylogenetic analyses of near full-length genome (NFLG) of HIV-1 URFs were performed. A new circulating recombinant form (CRF), designated as CRF104_0107, was found in three epidemiologically unlinked individuals in Shaanxi province, China. The CRF104_0107 is composed of genomes CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC, with six recombinant breakpoints in the gag, pol, vif and vpr genes. This second-generation CRF has a breakpoint (HXB2 nt 3011) in common with CRF07_BC. The emergence of novel CRF and multiple URFs reflected HIV-1 genetic complexity among the local key populations in Xi'an city, China.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567134820300885;5.2;4.9;5.0;15671348;S1567134820300885;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1567134820300885;;

Grow-ing evidence has emphasized the importance of both activation and repression of the host DDR by diverse DNA and RNA viruses. Previous work has shown that HIV-1 is also capable of engaging the host DDR, primarily through the conserved accessory protein Vpr. However, the extent of this engagement has remained unclear. Here, we show that HIV-1 and HIV-2 Vpr directly induce DNA damage and stall DNA replication, leading to the activation of several markers of double-and single-strand DNA breaks. Despite causing damage and activating the DDR, we found that Vpr represses the repair of double-strand breaks (DSB) by inhibiting homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Mutational analyses of Vpr re-vealed that DNA damage and DDR activation are independent from repression of HR and Vpr-mediated cell cycle arrest. Moreover, we show that repression of HR does not require cell cycle arrest but instead may precede this long-standing enigmatic Vpr phenotype. Together, our data uncover that Vpr globally modulates the host DDR at at least two independent steps, offering novel insight into the primary functions of lentiviral Vpr and the roles of the DNA damage response in lentiviral replica-tion. IMPORTANCE The DNA damage response (DDR) is a signaling cascade that safe-guards the genome from genotoxic agents, including human pathogens. However, the DDR has also been utilized by many pathogens, such as human immunodefi-ciency virus (HIV), to enhance infection. To properly treat HIV-positive individuals, we must understand how the virus usurps our own cellular processes. Here, we have found that an important yet poorly understood gene in HIV, Vpr, targets the DDR at two unique steps: it causes damage and activates DDR signaling, and it represses the ability of cells to repair this damage, which we hypothesize is central to the primary function of Vpr. In clarifying these important functions of Vpr, our work high-lights the multiple ways human pathogens engage the DDR and further suggests that modulation of the DDR is a novel way to help in the fight against HIV.;https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/4/e00940-20;11.2;10.5;9.9;21612129;;;;

All Rights Reserved.Antiretroviral therapy (ART) cannot eradicate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a rapid rebound of virus replication follows analytical treatment interruption (ATI) in the vast majority of HIV-infected individuals. Sustained control of HIV replication without ART has been documented in a subset of individuals, defined as posttreatment controllers (PTCs). The key determinants of post-ART viral control remain largely unclear. Here, we identified 7 SIVmac239-infected rhesus macaques (RMs), defined as PTCs, who started ART 8 weeks postinfection, continued ART for >7 months, and controlled plasma viremia at <104 copies/ml for up to 8 months after ATI and <200 copies/ml at the latest time point. We characterized immunologic and virologic features associated with post-ART SIV control in blood, lymph node (LN), and colorectal (RB) biopsy samples compared to 15 noncontroller (NC) RMs. Before ART initiation, PTCs had higher CD4 T cell counts, lower plasma viremia, and SIV-DNA content in blood and LN compared to NCs, but had similar CD8 T cell function. While levels of intestinal CD4 T cells were similar, PTCs had higher frequencies of Th17 cells. On ART, PTCs had significantly lower levels of residual plasma viremia and SIV-DNA content in blood and tissues. After ATI, SIV-DNA content rapidly increased in NCs, while it remained stable or even decreased in PTCs. Finally, PTCs showed immunologic benefits of viral control after ATI, including higher CD4 T cell levels and reduced immune activation. Overall, lower plasma viremia, reduced cell-associated SIV-DNA, and preserved Th17 homeostasis, including at pre-ART, are the main features associated with sustained viral control after ATI in SIV-infected RMs. IMPORTANCE While effective, antiretroviral therapy is not a cure for HIV infection. Therefore, there is great interest in achieving viral remission in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. Posttreatment controllers represent a small subset of individuals who are able to control HIV after cessation of antiretroviral therapy, but characteristics associated with these individuals have been largely limited to peripheral blood analysis. Here, we identified 7 SIV-infected rhesus macaques that mirrored the human posttreatment controller phenotype and performed immunologic and virologic analysis of blood, lymph node, and colorectal biopsy samples to further understand the characteristics that distinguish them from noncontrollers. Lower viral burden and preservation of immune homeostasis, including intestinal Th17 cells, both before and after ART, were shown to be two major factors associated with the ability to achieve posttreatment control. Overall, these results move the field further toward understanding of important characteristics of viral control in the absence of antiretroviral therapy.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/14/e00338-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

The efficacy of screening programs to prevent anal cancer in persons with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is unclear. Methods. To examine the impact of a screening program to detect anal cancer precursors on the incidence of cases of invasive anal squamous-cell carcinoma (IASCC) in persons with HIV-1, we performed a single-center, retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort of outpatients with HIV-1 attending a reference HIV unit from January 2005 onward. All participants were invited to participate in a continued structured screening program for anal cancer prevention. We estimated the incidence of IASCC and performed a comparative analysis between subjects enrolled in the screening program (screening group) and those who declined to participate (nonscreening group). To reduce any selection bias, a propensity score analysis was applied. Results. We included 3111 persons with HIV-1 (1596 men-who-have-sex-with-men [MSM], 888 men-who-have-sex-with-women [MSW], 627 women; mean age, 41 years), with a median follow-up of 4.7 years (14 595 patient-years of follow-up); 1691 (54%) participated in the screening program. Ten patients were diagnosed with IASCC: 2 (MSM) in the screening group and 8 (4 MSM, 2 MSW, and 2 women) in the nonscreening group. The incidence rates of IASCC were 21.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7-70.3) and 107.0 (95% CI, 46.2-202.0) per 100 000 person-years, respectively. After a propensity score adjustment, the difference was significant in favor of the screening group (hazard ratio, 0.17; 95% CI,.03-.86). Conclusions. The number of cases of IASCC was significantly lower in persons with HIV engaged in an anal cytology screening program. These results should be validated in a randomized clinical trial.";https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/2/390/5559772;14.0;13.8;12.5;10584838;;;;

Two linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MAVS gene render MAVS insensitive to HIV-1-dependent suppression, and have been shown to be associated with a lower viral load at set point and delayed increase of viral load during disease progression. Here, we studied the underlying mechanisms involved in the control of viral replication in individuals homozygous for this MAVS genotype. We observed that individuals with the MAVS minor genotype had more stable total CD4+ T cell counts during a 7-year follow up and had lower cell-associated proviral DNA loads. Genetic variation in MAVS did not affect immune activation levels; however, a significantly lower percentage of naïve CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells was observed in the MAVS minor genotype. In vitro HIV-1 infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors with the MAVS minor genotype resulted in decreased viral replication. Although the precise underlying mechanism remains unclear, our data suggest that the protective effect of the MAVS minor genotype may be exerted by the initiation of local innate responses affecting viral replication and CD4+ T cell susceptibility.";https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/7/764;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

All Rights Reserved.HIV-1 assembly occurs principally at the plasma membrane (PM) of infected cells. Gag polyprotein precursors (Pr55Gag) are targeted to the PM, and their binding is mediated by the interaction of myristoylated matrix domain and a PM-specific phosphoinositide, the phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2]. The major synthesis pathway of PI(4,5)P2 involves the activity of phosphatidylinositol-4phosphate 5-kinase family type 1 composed of three isoforms (PIP5K1, PIP5K1, and PIP5K1). To examine whether the activity of a specific PIP5K1 isoform determines proper Pr55Gag localization at the PM, we compared the cellular behavior of Pr55Gag in the context of PIP5K1 inhibition using siRNAs that individually targeted each of the three isoforms in TZM-bl HeLa cells. We found that downregulation of PIP5K1 and PIP5K1 strongly impaired the targeting of Pr55Gag to the PM with a rerouting of the polyprotein within intracellular compartments. The efficiency of Pr55Gag release was thus impaired through the silencing of these two isoforms, while PIP5K1 is dispensable for Pr55Gag targeting to the PM. The PM mistargeting due to the silencing of PIP5K1 leads to Pr55Gag hydrolysis through lysosome and proteasome pathways, while the silencing of PIP5K1 leads to Pr55Gag accumulation in late endosomes. Our findings demonstrated that, within the PIP5K1 family, only the PI(4,5)P2 pools produced by PIP5K1 and PIP5K1 are involved in the Pr55Gag PM targeting process. IMPORTANCE PM specificity of Pr55Gag membrane binding is mediated through the interaction of PI(4,5)P2 with the matrix (MA) basic residues. It was shown that over-expression of a PI(4,5)P2-depleting enzyme strongly impaired PM localization of Pr55Gag. However, cellular factors that control PI(4,5)P2 production required for Pr55Gag-PM targeting have not yet been characterized. In this study, by individually inhibiting PIP5K1 isoforms, we elucidated a correlation between PI(4,5)P2 metabolism pathways mediated by PIP5K1 isoforms and the targeting of Pr55Gag to the PM of TZM-bl HeLa cells. Confocal microscopy analyses of cells depleted from PIP5K1 and PIP5K1 show a rerouting of Pr55Gag to various intracellular compartments. Notably, Pr55Gag is degraded by the proteasome and/or by the lysosomes in PIP5K1depleted cells, while Pr55Gag is targeted to endosomal vesicles in PIP5K1-depleted cells. Thus, our results highlight, for the first time, the roles of PIP5K1 and PIP5K1 as determinants of Pr55Gag targeting to the PM.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/14/e00189-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

To determine whether differential rates of clonal proliferation or HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) pressure shape the provirus landscape, we performed an intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) and obtained 661 near-full-length provirus sequences from 8 individuals with suppressed viral loads on ART at time points 7 years apart. We observed slow decay of intact proviruses but no changes in the proportions of various types of defective proviruses. The proportion of intact proviruses in expanded clones was similar to that of defective proviruses in clones. Intact proviruses observed in clones did not have more escaped CTL epitopes than intact proviruses observed as singlets. Concordantly, total proviruses at later time points or observed in clones were not enriched in escaped or unrecognized epitopes. Three individuals with natural control of HIV-1 infection (controllers) on ART, included because controllers have strong HIV-1-specific CTL responses, had a smaller proportion of intact proviruses but a distribution of defective provirus types and escaped or unrecognized epitopes similar to that of the other individuals. This work suggests that CTL selection does not significantly check clonal proliferation of infected cells or greatly alter the provirus landscape in people on ART.;https://www.jci.org/articles/view/135953;21.2;19.0;17.0;00219738;;;;

EVs such as exosomes and microvesicles are membrane-bound vesicles ranging in size from 30 to 1000 nm in diameter. Under normal conditions, EVs mediate cell to cell as well as inter-organ communication via the shuttling of their cargoes which include RNA, DNA and proteins. Under pathological conditions, however, the number, size and content of EVs are found to be altered and have been shown to play crucial roles in disease progression. Emerging studies have demonstrated that EVs are involved in many aspects of viral infection-mediated neurodegenerative diseases. In the current review, we will describe the interactions between EV biogenesis and the release of virus particles while also reviewing the role of EVs in various viral infections, such as HIV-1, HTLV, Zika, CMV, EBV, Hepatitis B and C, JCV, and HSV-1. We will also discuss the potential uses of EVs and their cargoes as biomarkers and therapeutic vehicles for viral infections.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/7/700;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.To investigate the effects of oral bacteriotherapy on intestinal phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism, in this longitudinal, double-arm trial, 15 virally suppressed HIV+ individuals underwent blood and fecal sample collection at baseline and after 6 months of oral bacteriotherapy. A baseline fecal sample was collected from 15 healthy individuals and served as control group for the baseline levels of fecal phenylalanine and tyrosine. CD4 and CD8 immune activation (CD38+) was evaluated by flow cytometry. Amino acid evaluation on fecal samples was conducted by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. Results showed that HIV+ participants displayed higher baseline phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio values than healthy volunteers. A significand reduction in phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio and peripheral CD4+ CD38+ activation was observed at the end of oral bacteriotherapy. In conclusion, probiotics beneficially affect the immune activation of HIV+ individuals. Therefore, the restoration of intestinal amino acid metabolism could represent the mechanisms through which probiotics exert these desirable effects.;https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/10/7/274;4.2;4.8;3.1;;;;;

The available data on diseases, drugs, pharmacological effects, molecular targets, and drug-like substances, taking into account the combinatorics of the associative relationships between them, correspond to the Big Data. Analysis of such data requires application of modern computer-aided drug design methods. This review summarizes results obtained by the Laboratory for Structure-Function Based Drug Design, Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, in this area. We have developed approaches for identification of promising pharmacological targets, prediction of several thousand types of biological activity based on the structural formula of the compound, analysis of protein-ligand interactions considering local similarity of amino acid sequences, identifying of putative molecular mechanisms responsible for side effects of drugs, calculation of the integral toxicity of drugs taking into account their metabolism, in the human body, as well as prediction of resistant and sensitive strains and evaluation of the effectiveness of therapy by combinations of antiretroviral drugs in view of the molecular genetic peculiarities of the clinical isolates of HIV-1. Our computer programs are implemented as the web-services freely available in the Internet; they are used by thousands of researchers from many countries of the world to select the most promising substances for synthesis and to identify the priority areas for experimental testing of their biological activity.";http://link.springer.com/10.1134/S1990750820030117;0.6;0.7;0.8;19907508;;;;

DESIGN: Retrospective, observational, multicenter cohort. METHODS: Inclusion criteria: HIV-1 patients at least 18 years old having received DTG as part of their combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) between 1 April 2014 and 1 December 2017. Primary endpoint: rate of virologic suppression, defined as plasma HIV-1 viral load less than 50 copies/ml, at weeks 24, 48, and 96. Secondary endpoints: durability, expressed as probability of experiencing loss of virologic suppression by week 96 (defined as two consecutive HIV-1 viral load measurements of at least 200 copies/ml after having initially achieved virologic suppression); immunological response at weeks 24, 48, and 96; incidence of and reasons for DTG discontinuation; and change in weight at week 96. RESULTS: Four thousand, one hundred and one patients were included. Through 96 weeks, virologic suppression rate was 96% (on-treatment analysis), probability of experiencing loss of virologic suppression was 7%, and mean increase in CD4 cell count was 100 cells/l (SD 220). There were 785 (19.1%) discontinuations of DTG (8.9 discontinuations per 100 patient-years). The most common cause of discontinuation was an adverse drug reaction (ADR; 9.5%) with neuropsychiatric toxicity being the most prevalent (5.2%; 2.4 discontinuations per 100 patient-years). By week 96, the median change in weight for the study population was +2.0 kg (IQR -1 to 5). CONCLUSION: In this large cohort, DTG showed excellent virologic efficacy and was generally well tolerated.

All rights reserved.The ANRS-163 ETRAL trial, a switch study to an etravirine 200 mg/raltegravir 400 mg twice-daily regimen in 165 patients with HIV-1 infection, showed durable efficacy until Week 96. The aim of this work was to investigate in detail the virological rebounds (VRs), defined as at least one plasma HIV viral load (VL) >50 copies/mL. Methods: Quantification of HIV-DNA level was assessed at baseline, Week 48 and Week 96 (n = 157). VLs were measured in seminal plasma at Week 48 (n = 26). Genotypic resistance testing by ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) for reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase regions was performed at baseline and at the time of VR. Results: In this study, 19 patients experienced VR, with 2 patients having virological failure (VF; two consecutive VLs >50 copies/mL). For the first patient with VF, UDS detected minority resistant variants only in RT (K103N, 9.6%; Y181C, 4.9%) at baseline. Some RT variants became dominant at VF (K101E, 86.3%; Y181C, 100.0%; G190A, 100.0%) and others emerged in integrase (Y143C, 2.4%; Q148R, 6.2%; N155H, 18.8%). For the second patient with VF, neither RT nor integrase mutations were detected at baseline and VF. Median HIV-DNA level was similar at baseline, Week 48 and Week 96 (2.17, 2.06 and 2.11 log 10 copies/106 cells, respectively). Only one patient had a detectable seminal HIV VL (505 copies/mL). Conclusions: The dual etravirine/raltegravir regimen as maintenance therapy was effective and the emergence of mutations in cases of VF was similar to that seen in other dual-regimen studies. No HIV-DNA level modification was evidenced by Week 96.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/7/1943/5817086;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;;

Enveloped VLPs are a class of these nanoparticles and their production process occurs by a budding process, which is known to be the most critical step at intracellular level. In this study, we developed a novel imaging method based on super-resolution fluorescence microscopy (SRFM) to assess the generation of VLPs in living cells. This methodology was applied to study the production of Gag VLPs in three animal cell platforms of reference: HEK 293-transient gene expression (TGE), High Five-baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) and Sf9-BEVS. Quantification of the number of VLP assembly sites per cell ranged from 500 to 3,000 in the different systems evaluated. Although the BEVS was superior in terms of Gag polyprotein expression, the HEK 293-TGE platform was more efficient regarding the assembly of Gag as VLPs. This was translated into higher levels of non-assembled Gag monomer in BEVS harvested supernatants. Furthermore, the presence of contaminating nanoparticles was evidenced in all three systems, specifically in High Five cells. The SRFM-based method here developed was also successfully applied to measure the concentration of VLPs in crude supernatants. The lipid membrane of VLPs and the presence of nucleic acids alongside these nanoparticles could also be detected using common staining procedures. Overall, a complete picture of the VLP production process was achieved in these three production platforms. The robustness and sensitivity of this new approach broaden the applicability of SRFM toward the development of new detection, diagnosis and quantification methods based on confocal microscopy in living systems.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bit.27345;7.8;7.7;7.1;00063592;;;;

We collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 272 children with retinopathy-negative or retinopathy-positive CM and selected CSF from 111 of these children (38 retinopathy positive, 71 retinopathy negative, 2 retinopathy unknown) for analysis by metagenomic next-generation sequencing. We found CSF viral coinfections in 7/38 (18.4%) retinopathy-positive children and in 18/71 (25.4%) retinopathy-negative children. Excluding HIV-1, human herpesviruses (HHV) represented 61% of viruses identified. Excluding HIV-1, CNS viral coinfection was equally likely in children who were retinopathy positive and retinopathy negative (P = 0.1431). Neither mortality nor neurological morbidity was associated with the presence of virus (odds ratio [OR] = 0.276, 95% CI: 0.056–1.363). Retinopathy-negative children with a higher temperature, lower white blood cell count, or being dehydrated were more likely to have viral coinfection. Level of consciousness at admission was not associated with CNS viral coinfection in retinopathy-negative children. Viral CNS coinfection is unlikely to contribute to coma in children with CM. The herpesviruses other than herpes simplex virus may represent incidental bystanders in CM, reactivating during acute malaria infection.;http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.19-0962;4.2;4.2;4.0;00029637;;;;

In this rapid communication, a unique algorithm to determine FP-rTTHc conjugation ratio was developed based off the amino acid analysis. Five well recovered amino acids (present in both FP and rTTHc) were used to calculate the conjugation ratio, while proline (present only in rTTHc) was identified and utilized as the intrinsic internal standard for normalization. With this calculation, the assay variability was minimized (<20%), especially for conjugates with moderate to low conjugation ratios as being compared to previously reported methods.

Despite their wide use, these enzymes' behaviors at chemical modified nucleotides remain poorly understood. Wellington-Oguri et al. recently reported an apparent loss of chemical modification within putatively unstructured polyadenosine stretches modified by dimethyl sulfate or 2 hydroxyl acylation, as probed by reverse transcription. Here, reanalysis of these and other publicly available data, capillary electrophoresis experiments on chemically modified RNAs, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on (A)12 and variants show that this effect is unlikely to arise from an unusual structure of polyadenosine. Instead, tests of different reverse transcriptases on chemically modified RNAs and molecules synthesized with single 1-methyladenosines implicate a previously uncharacterized reverse transcriptase behavior: near-quantitative bypass through chemical modifications within polyadenosine stretches. All tested natural and engineered reverse transcriptases (MMLV; SuperScript II, III, and IV; TGIRT-III; and MarathonRT) exhibit this anomalous bypass behavior. Accurate DMS-guided structure modeling of the polyadenylated HIV-1 3 untranslated region requires taking into account this anomaly. Our results suggest that poly(rA-dT) hybrid duplexes can trigger an unexpectedly effective reverse transcriptase bypass and that chemical modifications in mRNA poly(A) tails may be generally undercounted.";https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.biochem.0c00020;5.4;5.2;5.3;00062960;;;;

Results: 96 economic migrants, asylum seekers and refugees from 43 countries were screened (46 [47.9%] women; mean age 35.2 years [SD 11.7; range 18–73]; mean time in the UK 4.8 years [SD 3.2; range 0–10]). 14 migrants (14.6%) tested positive for LTBI alongside HIV [1], hepatitis B [2], and hepatitis C [1] Of migrants with LTBI, 5 (35.7%) were successfully engaged in treatment. 74 (77.1%) migrants reported no previous screening since migrating to the UK. Conclusion: Multi-disease screening in this setting is feasible and merits being further tested in larger-scale studies. However, greater emphasis must be placed on ensuring successful treatment outcomes. We identified major gaps in current screening provision; most migrants had been offered no prior screening despite several years since migration, which holds relevance to policy and practice in the UK and other European countries.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1477893920300788;4.1;4.1;4.7;14778939;S1477893920300788;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1477893920300788;;

KGaA, WeinheimDouble electron-electron resonance (DEER) EPR spectroscopy is a powerful method for obtaining distance distributions between pairs of engineered nitroxide spin-labels in proteins and other biological macromolecules. These measurements require the use of cryogenic temperatures (77 K or less) to prolong the phase memory relaxation time (Tm) sufficiently to enable detection of a DEER echo curve. Generally, a cryoprotectant such as glycerol is added to protein samples to facilitate glass formation and avoid protein clustering (which can result in a large decrease in Tm) during relatively slow flash freezing in liquid N2. However, cryoprotectants are osmolytes and can influence protein folding/unfolding equilibria, as well as species populations in weak multimeric systems. Here we show that submillisecond rapid freezing, achieved by high velocity spraying of the sample onto a rapidly spinning, liquid nitrogen cooled copper disc obviates the requirement for cryoprotectants and permits high quality DEER data to be obtained in absence of glycerol. We demonstrate this approach on five different protein systems: protein A, the metastable drkN SH3 domain, urea-unfolded drkN SH3, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and the transmembrane domain of HIV-1 gp41 in lipid bicelles.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cphc.202000312;5.5;5.4;5.6;14394235;;;;

KGaA, WeinheimSince the beginning of the HIV epidemic, research has been carried out to control the virus. Understanding the mechanisms of replication has given access to the various classes of drugs that over time have transformed AIDS into a manageable chronic disease. The class of protease inhibitors (PIs) gained notice in anti-retroviral therapy, once it was found that peptidomimetic molecules act by blocking the active catalytic center of the aspartic protease, which is directly related to HIV maturation. However, mutations in enzymatic internal residues are the biggest issue for these drugs, because a small change in biochemical interaction can generate resistance. Low plasma concentrations of PIs favor viral natural selection; high concentrations can inhibit even partially resistant enzymes. Food-drug/drug-drug interactions can decrease the bioavailability of PIs and are related to many side effects. Therefore, this review summarizes the pharmacokinetic properties of current PIs, the changes when pharmacological boosters are used and also lists the major mutations to help understanding of how long the continuous treatment can ensure a low viral load in patients.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cmdc.202000101;5.0;4.4;5.5;18607179;;;;

The experimental “shock-and-kill” therapeutic approach involves use of latency-reversal agents (LRAs) that reactivate HIV expression in reservoir-containing cells, followed by infected cell elimination through viral or host immune cytopathic effects. Several LRAs that function as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are reported to reverse HIV latency in cells and in clinical trials; however, none to date have consistently reduced viral reservoirs in humans, prompting a need to identify new LRAs. Toward this goal, we describe here a virtual screening (VS) approach which uses 14 reported HDAC inhibitors to probe PubChem and identifies 60 LRA candidates. We then show that four screening “hits” including (S)-N-Hydroxy-4-(3-methyl-2-phenylbutanamido)benzamide (compound 15), N-(4-Aminophenyl)heptanamide (16), N-[4-(Heptanoylamino)phenyl]heptanamide (17), and 4-(1,3-Dioxo-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl)-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)butanamide (18) inhibit HDAC activity and/or reverse HIV latency in vitro. This study demonstrates and supports that VS-based approaches can readily identify novel HDAC inhibitors and LRAs, which in turn may help toward inhibitor design and chemical optimization efforts for improved HIV shock-and-kill-based efforts.";https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fphar.2020.00905/full;4.7;3.9;5.0;;;;;

This is in part due to the relative simplicity of crafting their rules and the convenience of visualizing disease dynamics in 2D. Although such models appeared in 2001 and have been extended in dozens of studies, their potential to serve as a virtual laboratory has been limited by their computationally intensive nature. So far, they have been used to simulate at most 0.5 million cells instead of the billion cells that may harbor the virus. Simulating too few cells is a key issue for calibration (the 'small' models are calibrated based on results observed in a much larger space), prevents us from using a sufficient proportion of cells to model latent HIV reservoirs (in which HIV can hide for years), and prohibits even more computationally intensive aspects such as tracking mutations (which is essential to assess drug resistance). In short, the low number of cells prevents these models from answering many of the questions that would make them useful as virtual laboratories. Although the models may be scaled by running on clusters, this is not always an option since interdisciplinary research in discrete models of HIV often takes place on the lab's computer, and patients for whom we seek to provide virtual laboratories may have limited access to computational resources. Given these constraints, we demonstrate how to optimize simulations of HIV on a workstation by combining features such as just-in-time compilation, parallelism at the level of threads, pseudo random number generators, and simplified handling of neighbors in a cellular automaton. Our results demonstrate that, within 10 minutes, we can finish a simulation run for 6.7 billion cells instead of 60,000 cells in an unoptimized simulation.;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3384441.3395987;0;0;0;;;;true;9781450375924

However, the underlying mechanism of how Vif induces G2 arrest is not fully understood, and more specifically, direct target molecules of G2 arrest have not been identified. Here we show that degradation of B56 family proteins (PP2A-B56), one of the regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 2A, is critical for the Vif-induced G2 arrest. NL4-3 Vif caused degradation of PP2A-B56, and complementation of PP2A-B56 overcome the Vif-induced arrest. Supportively, knockdown of PPP2R5D, one of PP2A-B56, by siRNA itself induced cell cycle arrest of non-infected cells. We also identified Vif residues I31 and R or K33 are determinants for inducing G2 arrest, and Vif variants that did not cause G2 arrest did not induce PPP2R5D degradation, although it maintain the ability to induce APOBEC3G degradation, showing strong correlation between Vif-induced arrest and PP2A-B56 degradation. In a sequence database of HIV-1 isolates, Vif strains harboring residues that presumably induce cell cycle arrest are approximately 43%, suggesting Vif-induced G2 arrest contributes to HIV-1 infection in vivo and spread. Our data help understand the mechanism of Vif-mediated arrest, and gain insights into general cell cycle regulation.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006291X20308639;4.4;4.2;4.6;0006291X;S0006291X20308639;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006291X20308639;;

However, with the recent failure of the HVTN 702 clinical trial, comprehensive profiling of humoral immune responses may provide insight for these disappointing results. One of the changes included in the HVTN 702 study was the addition of a late boost, aimed at augmenting peak immunity and durability. The companion vaccine trial RV305 was designed to permit the evaluation of the immunologic impact of late boosting with either the boosting protein antigen alone, the canarypox viral vector ALVAC alone, or a combination of both. Although previous data showed elevated levels of IgG antibodies in both boosting arms, regardless of ALVAC-HIV vector incorporation, the effect on shaping antibody effector function remains unclear. Thus, here we analyzed the antibody and functional profile induced by RV305 boosting regimens and found that although IgG1 levels increased in both arms that included protein boosting, IgG3 levels were reduced compared with the original RV144 vaccine strategy. Most functional responses increased upon protein boosting, regardless of the viral vector-priming agent incorporation. These data suggest that the addition of a late protein boost alone is sufficient to increase functionally potent vaccine-specific antibodies previously associated with reduced risk of infection with HIV.;https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/135057;0;2.6;5.8;;;;;

With the presently available combination antiretroviral therapeutic arsenal, AIDS is now a manageable disease but with no cure available till date. The development of novel antivirals consumes an extensive amount of time and resources. Hence, repurposing of the established gold standard molecules for their anti-HIV application is enormously advantageous. In this study, we report that N-p-Tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) inhibits HIV-1 replication in a highly-conserved manner. Further, TPCK inhibits HIV-1 replication at the late stages of its life cycle by impeding viral protease (PR) enzyme activity. Additionally, our results demonstrate that the combination of TPCK with established HIV-1 PR inhibitors shows significant synergistic inhibitory potential, suggesting the potential use of TPCK in cART regimen. Collectively, we report the anti-HIV activity of TPCK, which should be further characterized for its translational applications.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006291X20308226;4.4;4.2;4.6;0006291X;S0006291X20308226;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006291X20308226;;

We report here a sex-biased interferogenic phenotype for a frequent single-nucleotide polymorphism of human TLR7, rs179008, displaying an impact on key parameters of acute HIV-1 infection. We show allele rs179008 T to determine lower TLR7 protein abundance in cells from women, specifically — likely by diminishing TLR7 mRNA translation efficiency through codon usage. The hypomorphic TLR7 phenotype is mirrored by decreased TLR7-driven IFN-I production by female pDCs. Among women from the French ANRS PRIMO cohort of acute HIV-1 patients, carriage of allele rs179008 T associated with lower viremia, cell-associated HIV-1 DNA, and CXCL10 (IP-10) plasma concentrations. RNA viral load was decreased by 0.85 log10 (95% CI, -1.51 to -0.18) among T/T homozygotes, who also exhibited a lower frequency of acute symptoms. TLR7 emerges as an important control locus for acute HIV-1 viremia, and the clinical phenotype for allele rs179008 T, carried by 30%–50% of European women, supports a beneficial effect of toning down TLR7-driven IFN-I production by pDCs during acute HIV-1 infection.;https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/136047;0;2.6;5.8;;;;;

HIV-1 must express all of its gene products from a single primary transcript, which undergoes alternative splicing to produce diverse protein products that include structural proteins and regulatory factors1,2. Despite the critical role of alternative splicing, the mechanisms that drive the choice of splice site are poorly understood. Synonymous RNA mutations that lead to severe defects in splicing and viral replication indicate the presence of unknown cis-regulatory elements3. Here we use dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq) to investigate the structure of HIV-1 RNA in cells, and develop an algorithm that we name ‘detection of RNA folding ensembles using expectation–maximization’ (DREEM), which reveals the alternative conformations that are assumed by the same RNA sequence. Contrary to previous models that have analysed population averages4, our results reveal heterogeneous regions of RNA structure across the entire HIV-1 genome. In addition to confirming that in vitro characterized5 alternative structures for the HIV-1 Rev responsive element also exist in cells, we discover alternative conformations at critical splice sites that influence the ratio of transcript isoforms. Our simultaneous measurement of splicing and intracellular RNA structure provides evidence for the long-standing hypothesis6–8 that heterogeneity in RNA conformation regulates splice-site use and viral gene expression.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2253-5;53.7;55.7;51.0;00280836;;;;

Among these, three inhibitors which embody a halobenzene ring derivative (HR) in their structures are presently used in clinics. High-resolution X-ray crystallography of the complexes of the IN-viral DNA transient complex bound to each of the three inhibitors showed in all cases the HR ring to interact within a confined zone of the viral DNA, limited to the highly conserved 5CpA 3/5TpG 3 step. The extension of its extracyclic CX bond is electron-depleted, owing to the existence of the “sigma-hole.” It interacts favorably with the electron-rich rings of base G4. We have sought to increase the affinity of HR derivatives for the G4/C16 base pair. We thus designed thirteen novel derivatives and computed their Quantum Chemistry (QC) intermolecular interaction energies (E) with this base-pair. Most compounds had E values significantly more favorable than those of the HR of the most potent halobenzene drug presently used in clinics, Dolutegravir. This should enable the improvement in a modular piece-wise fashion, the affinities of halogenated inhibitors for viral DNA (vDNA). In view of large scale polarizable molecular dynamics simulations on the entirety of the IN-vDNA-inhibitor complexes, validations of the SIBFA polarizable method are also reported, in which the evolution of each E(SIBFA) contribution is compared to its QC counterpart along this series of derivatives.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fchem.2020.00440/full;7.0;2.1;2.5;;;;;

Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), low-level persistent HIV replication in these reservoirs remains detectable, which contributes to neuroinflammation and neurological disorders in HIV-infected patients. New approaches complementary to ART to repress residual HIV replication in CNS reservoirs are needed. Our group has recently identified a BRD4-selective small molecule modulator (ZL0580) that induces the epigenetic suppression of HIV. Here, we examined the effects of this compound on HIV in human myeloid cells. We found that ZL0580 induces potent and durable suppression of both induced and basal HIV transcription in microglial cells (HC69) and monocytic cell lines (U1 and OM10.1). Pretreatment of microglia with ZL0580 renders them more refractory to latent HIV reactivation, indicating an epigenetic reprogramming effect of ZL0580 on HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) in microglia. We also demonstrate that ZL0580 induces repressive effect on HIV in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) by promoting HIV suppression during ART treatment. Mechanistically, ZL0580 inhibits Tat transactivation in microglia by disrupting binding of Tat to CDK9, a process key to HIV transcription elongation. High-resolution micrococcal nuclease mapping showed that ZL0580 induces a repressive chromatin structure at the HIV LTR. Taken together, our data suggest that ZL0580 represents a potential approach that could be used in combination with ART to suppress residual HIV replication and/or latent HIV reactivation in CNS reservoirs, thereby reducing HIV-associated neuroinflammation.;http://jvi.asm.org/lookup/doi/10.1128/JVI.01880-19;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

War-related traumas combined with difficulties accessing HIV prevention and health services has led to extreme HIV-related vulnerability among conflict-affected people who survived the war. Objectives were to (1) determine HIV incidence among conflict-affected people in Northern Uganda and (2) identify vulnerabilities associated with HIV infection. Methods: The Cango Lyec (Healing the Elephant) Project is a prospective cohort involving conflict-affected populations in three districts in Northern Uganda. In 2011, eight randomly selected communities were mapped, and a census was conducted. Consenting participants aged 13–49 years were followed over three rounds of follow-up. Longitudinal data collected included war-related experiences, sexual vulnerabilities, and sociodemographics. Blood samples were tested for HIV-1 at baseline and each 12-month follow-up. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models determined factors associated with HIV incidence. Findings: Overall, 1920 baseline HIV-negative participants with at least one follow-up contributed 3877 person-years (py) for analysis. Thirty-nine (23 female, 16 male) participants contracted HIV during follow-up. Age- and gender-standardised HIV incidence rate was 10•2 per 1000py (95%CI: 7•2-14•0). Stratified by sex, the age-adjusted HIV incidence was 11•0 per 1000py (95%CI: 6•9-16•6) among women and 9•4 per 1000py (95%CI: 5•3-15•3) among men. Adjusting for confounders, factors associated with risk of HIV included: having been abducted (HR: 3•70; 95%CI: 1•87-7•34), experiencing 12 war-related traumatic events (HR: 2•91 95%CI: 1•28-6•60), suicide ideation (HR: 2•83; 95%CI: 1•00-8•03), having 2 sexual partners (HR: 4•68; 95%CI: 1•36-16•05), inconsistent condom use (HR: 6•75; 95%CI: 2•49-18•29), and self-reported genital ulcers (HR: 4•39; 95%CI: 2•04-9•45). Interpretation: Conflict-affected participants who had experienced abduction and multiple traumas during the war were at greater risk of HIV infection. Trauma-informed HIV prevention and treatment services, and culturally-safe mental health initiatives, are urgent for Northern Uganda.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589537020301528;0;0;1.7;;S2589537020301528;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2589537020301528;;

Yet, it is unknown whether long-lived infected brain cells release productive virus that can egress from the brain to re-seed peripheral organs. This understanding has significant implication for the brain as a reservoir for HIV and most importantly HIV interplay between the brain and peripheral organs. Given the sheer number of astrocytes in the human brain and their controversial role in HIV infection, we evaluated their infection in vivo and whether HIV infected astrocytes can support HIV egress to peripheral organs. We developed two novel models of chimeric human astrocyte/ human peripheral blood mononuclear cells: NOD/scid-IL-2Rgc null (NSG) mice (huAstro/ HuPBMCs) whereby we transplanted HIV (non-pseudotyped or VSVg-pseudotyped) infected or uninfected primary human fetal astrocytes (NHAs) or an astrocytoma cell line (U138MG) into the brain of neonate or adult NSG mice and reconstituted the animals with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We also transplanted uninfected astrocytes into the brain of NSG mice and reconstituted with infected PBMCs to mimic a biological infection course. As expected, the xenotransplanted astrocytes did not escape/ migrate out of the brain and the blood brain barrier (BBB) was intact in this model. We demonstrate that astrocytes support HIV infection in vivo and egress to peripheral organs, at least in part, through trafficking of infected CD4+ T cells out of the brain. Astrocyte-derived HIV egress persists, albeit at low levels, under combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Egressed HIV evolved with a pattern and rate typical of acute peripheral infection. Lastly, analysis of human cortical or hippocampal brain regions of donors under cART revealed that astrocytes harbor between 0.4-5.2% integrated HIV gag DNA and 2-7% are HIV gag mRNA positive. These studies establish a paradigm shift in the dynamic interaction between the brain and peripheral organs which can inform eradication of HIV reservoirs.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008381;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

The present study was carried out to delineate the underlying molecular mechanisms of immunological non-responsiveness to HIV therapy. Design: We conducted microarray-based whole gene expression profiles of 30 subjects infected with HIV-1 subtype C, in peripheral blood to discern the signature genes associated with immunological non-responsiveness. After a thorough analysis and comparison of geneexpression profiles, microarray data was validated via qRT-PCR approach. Results: Overall, we found 10 genes significantly up-regulated and 60 genes down-regulated (2- fold change) in immunological non-responders as compared to responders. Based on these results and pathway analysis of the protein-protein interaction, 20 genes were shortlisted for validation in human infected cases. We found statistically significant differences in expression levels of twelve genes IL-1, IL-1, IL-7R, TNF-, FoxP3, PDCD5, COX7B, SOCS1, SOCS3, RPL9, RPL23, and LRRN3 respectively among immunological non-responders compared to therapy responders, confirming their an intimate relationship with immunological responsiveness to therapy. Conclusions: Altogether, microarray and qRT-PCR validation results indicated that the aberrant expression of key genes involved in the regulation of T cell homeostasis, immune activation, inflammatory cytokine production, apoptosis, and immune-regulatory processes are possibly associated with immunological non-responsiveness in HIV-1 C infected individuals on ART.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234270;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are typically isolated by using soluble Env trimers, which do not capture all Env states. To address these limitations, we devised a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based probe to display membrane-embedded Env trimers and isolated five bNAbs from two chronically infected donors, M4008 and M1214. Donor B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires identified two bNAb lineages, M4008_N1 and M1214_N1, that class-switched to immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA. Variants of these bNAbs reconstituted as IgA demonstrated broadly neutralizing activity, and the IgA fraction of M1214 plasma conferred neutralization.

In contrast, the rare HIV-2UC1 strain is noncytopathic and has no effect on CD4 expression in infected cells but still replicates as efficiently as more cytopathic strains in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Here, we show that HIV-2UC1 Env interactions with the CD4 receptor exhibit slow association kinetics, whereas the dissociation kinetics is within the range of cytopathic strains. Despite the resulting 10- to 100-fold decrease in binding affinity, HIV-2UC1 Envs exhibit long-lived activation state and efficient fusion activity. These observations suggest that HIV-2UC1 Envs evolved to balance low affinity with an improved and readily triggerable molecular machinery to mediate entry. Resistance to cold exposure, similar to many primary HIV-1 isolates, and to sCD4 neutralization suggests that HIV-2UC1 Envs preferentially sample a closed Env conformation.

We identified two different promoter variant strains circulating in this region along with the globally circulating common promoter variant. Seven sequences had an additional nuclear factor kappa-light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) binding motif and the sequence from another subject showed one NF-B and one RBE-III binding site. Phylogenetic and subtyping analyses revealed that the circulating strains comprised HIV-2 subtype A. The occurrence of two NF-B binding sites in 30% of the sequences analyzed in our study prompts us to hypothesize that as in the case of HIV-1 subtype C viruses that possess additional B sites, the two NF-B HIV-2 variants might possess superior replication fitness because of the increased magnitude of transcription, thus leading to the expansion of these variants in the country.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2020.0027;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;;

During the earliest stages of infection, this process of evolution is very rapid, driven by a small number of CTL escape mutations. As the infection progresses, immune escape variants evolve under reduced magnitudes of selection, while competition between an increasing number of polymorphic alleles (i.e., clonal interference) makes it difficult to quantify the magnitude of selection acting upon specific variant alleles. To tackle this complex problem, we developed a novel multi-locus inference method to evaluate the role of selection during the chronic stage of within-host infection. We applied this method to targeted sequence data from the p24 and gp41 regions of HIV-1 collected from 34 patients with long-term untreated HIV-1 infection. We identify a broad distribution of beneficial fitness effects during infection, with a small number of variants evolving under strong selection and very many variants evolving under weaker selection. The uniquely large number of infections analysed granted a previously unparalleled statistical power to identify loci at which selection could be inferred to act with statistical confidence. Our model makes no prior assumptions about the nature of alleles under selection, such that any synonymous or non-synonymous variant may be inferred to evolve under selection. However, the majority of variants inferred with confidence to be under selection were non-synonymous in nature, and in most cases were have previously been associated with either CTL escape in p24 or neutralising antibody escape in gp41. We also identified a putative new CTL escape site (residue 286 in gag), and a region of gp41 (including residues 644, 648, 655 in env) likely to be associated with immune escape. Sites inferred to be under selection in multiple hosts have high within-host and between-host diversity although not all sites with high between-host diversity were inferred to be under selection at the within-host level. Our identification of selection at sites associated with resistance to broadly neutralising antibodies (bNAbs) highlights the need to fully understand the role of selection in untreated individuals when designing bNAb based therapies.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008171;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

We have investigated KSHV prevalence and factors associated with KSHV infection in Tanzania. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of voluntary blood-donors from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Plasma was screened for KSHV, HIV-1, HBV, HCV and Treponema pallidum (syphilis). Associations between KSHV sero-status and risk factors were analyzed. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported to evaluate risk factors of KSHV infection. All tests were 2-tailed, and P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: The overall KSHV seroprevalence was 56.9%. Significantly increased risk of KSHV infection was detected in persons from the Lake and Central Zones (OR = 6.4, 95% CI = 1.6–25.3, P = 0.008 and OR = 5.7, 95% CI = 1.0–32.5, P = 0.048 respectively). A trend toward increased risk of KSHV infection with HIV-1 co-infection was not significant (OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.0–8.0, P = 0.06). Seroreactivity to T. pallidum was surprisingly high (14.9%). Conclusion: The prevalence of KSHV infection and syphilis was high among Tanzanian blood-donors. The most common transfusion-transmissible infections did not associate with KSHV infection.

Elucidating the proviral genetic composition of the reservoir, particularly in the context of pre-therapy viral diversity, is therefore important to understanding reservoir formation and the persistence of latently infected cells. Here we investigate reservoir proviral variants from 13 Zambian acutely-infected individuals with additional pre-therapy sampling for a unique comparison to the ART-naïve quasispecies. We identified complete transmitted/founder (TF) viruses from seroconversion plasma samples, and additionally amplified and sequenced HIV-1 from plasma obtained one year post-infection and just prior to ART initiation. While the majority of proviral variants in the reservoir were most closely related to viral variants from the latest pre-therapy time point, we also identified reservoir proviral variants dating to or near the time of infection, and to intermediate time points between infection and treatment initiation. Reservoir proviral variants differing by five or fewer nucleotide changes from the TF virus persisted during treatment in five individuals, including proviral variants that exactly matched the TF in two individuals, one of whom had remained ART-naïve for more than six years. Proviral variants during treatment were significantly less divergent from the TF virus than plasma variants present at the last ART-naïve time point. These findings indicate that reservoir proviral variants are archived throughout infection, recapitulating much of the viral diversity that arises throughout untreated HIV-1 infection, and strategies to target and reduce the reservoir must therefore permit for the clearance of proviruses encompassing this extensive diversity.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008378;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

In the current era of antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-1 replication is well-suppressed, and yet, HIV-1-infected patients still have high levels of chronic inflammation, indicating that factors other than viral replication are contributing to the development of neurocognitive impairment in these patients. The underlying mechanisms of HAND are still unknown, but the HIV-1 protein, Tat, has been highlighted as a potential viral product that contributes to the development of cognitive impairment. In AD, the presence of senescent cells in the CNS has been discussed as a contributing factor to the progression of cognitive decline and may be a mechanism also involved in the development of HAND. This mini-review discusses the viral protein HIV-1 Tat, and its potential to induce senescence in the CNS, contributing to the development of HAND.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00168/full;6.5;5.5;6.3;;;;;

Members of the Thymelaeaceae family have been of interest owing to their excellent medicinal value. Given the successful history of natural product-based drug discovery, extracts from the aerial parts of Thymelaea hirsuta were evaluated for their potential antihuman immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) activity. Ethyl acetate extracts from leaves (71B) and branches (72B) of Thymelaea hirsuta showed potent and selective activity against HIV-1 wt (EC50 = 0.8 g/mL) at non-cytotoxic concentrations (CC50 > 100 g/mL). They proved to be active against HIV-1 variants carrying clinically relevant NNRTI and NRTI mutations at low concentration (0.3-4 g/mL range) and against the M-tropic strain HIV-1 BaL. The 72B extract, chosen as a lead, was not able to inhibit the RT and protease enzymatic functions. Furthermore, it was not virucidal, since exposure of HIV to high concentration did not affect virus infectivity. The pre-clinical safety profile of this extract showed no adverse effect on the growth of Lactobacilli, and non-toxic concentration of the extract did not influence the Caco-2 epithelial cells monolayer integrity. Additionally, extract 72B prevented syncytia formation at low concentration (0.4 g/mL). The potent inhibitory effect on the syncytia formation in co-cultures showed that 72B inhibits an early event in the replication cycle of HIV. All of these findings prompt us to carry on new studies on Thymelaea hirsuta extracts.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/6/664;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

In particular, for the HIV-1 genome to enter the nucleus, it must be led through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). During the HIV-1 cytoplasmic journey, the viral core acts as a shell to protect the viral genetic material from antiviral sensors and ensure an adequate environment for reverse transcription. However, the relatively narrow size of the nuclear pore channel requires that the HIV-1 core is reshaped into a structure that fits the pore. On the other hand, the organization of the viral CA proteins that remain associated with the preintegration complex (PIC) during and after nuclear translocation is still enigmatic. In this study, we analyzed the progressive organizational changes of viral CA proteins within the cytoplasm and the nucleus by immunogold labeling. Furthermore, we set up a novel technology, HIV-1 ANCHOR, which enables the specific detection of the retrotranscribed DNA by fluorescence microscopy, thereby offering the opportunity to uncover the architecture of the potential HIV-1 PIC. Thus, we combined the immunoelectron microscopy and ANCHOR technologies to reveal the presence of DNA- and CA-positive complexes by correlated light and electron microscopy (CLEM). During and after nuclear translocation, HIV-1 appears as a complex of viral DNA decorated by multiple viral CA proteins remodeled in a pearl necklace-like shape. Thus, we could describe how CA proteins are reshaped around the viral DNA to permit the entrance of the HIV-1 in the nucleus. This particular CA protein complex composed of the integrase and the retrotranscribed DNA leads the HIV-1 genome inside the host nucleus. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the early steps of HIV-1 infection and provide new insights into the organization of HIV-1 CA proteins during and after viral nuclear entry. Of note, we are now able to visualize the viral DNA in viral complexes, opening up new perspectives for future studies on virus's fate in the cell nucleus.;http://jvi.asm.org/lookup/doi/10.1128/JVI.00135-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

Karger AG, Basel.Background: Transplantation of human corneal tissue is associated with the potential risk of transmittance of viral infections. In accordance with European directives and federal laws, in Germany each tissue donor has to be tested for infectious diseases such as hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, most of the currently available CE-marked serologic and nucleic acid screening systems are only validated for antemortem blood. Methods: Twenty related and paired ante- and postmortem blood samples from cornea donors were obtained and subsequently analyzed for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B antibody (anti-HBc), anti-HCV, HCV RNA, anti-HIV-1/2, and HIV p24 Ag using Abbott test systems. The sera were also spiked with reference materials in concentrations giving low and high positivity for HBV, HCV, and HIV markers. Results: The spiked ante- and postmortem sera from related donors showed similar results for HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, HCV RNA, anti-HIV, and HIV p24 Ag, indicating a high stability of viral markers in cadaveric specimens. Three cornea donors had a medical history of HBV infection and revealed anti-HBc at similar levels in the ante- and postmortem sera. In addition, there was a single postmortem sample demonstrating a weak signal of anti-HIV-1 and HIV-1 p24 Ag. False-positive or false-negative results were not detected. The results obtained with the Abbott ARCHITECT analyzer and Abbott RealTime HCV PCR showed no significant differences. Conclusion: The analyzed screening assays are suitable for the detection of infectious markers of HBV, HCV, and HIV at similar levels in spiked ante- and postmortem sera from cornea donors.;https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/502866;4.0;4.3;5.0;16603796;;;;

Here we explore phenotypic drug resistance in such patients in order to better understand this phenomenon. Patients (n = 71) failing a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen, but who subsequently re-suppressed on the same regimen, were assessed for HIV-1 genotypic drug resistance through Sanger sequencing. A subset (n = 23) of these samples, as well as genotypically matched samples from patients who did not re-suppress (n = 19), were further assessed for phenotypic drug resistance in an in vitro single cycle assay. Half of the patients (n = 36/71, 51%) harboured genotypic drug resistance, with M184V (n = 18/36, 50%) and K103N (n = 16/36, 44%) being the most prevalent mutations. No significant difference in the median time to re-suppression (31-39 weeks) were observed for either group (p = 0.41). However, re-suppressors with mutant virus rebounded significantly earlier than those with wild-type virus (16 vs. 33 weeks; p = 0.014). Similar phenotypic drug resistance profiles were observed between patients who re-suppressed and patients who failed to re-suppress. While most remained susceptible to stavudine (d4T) and zidovudine (AZT), both groups showed a reduced susceptibility to 3TC and NNRTIs. HIV- 1 infected patients on an NNRTI-based regimen can achieve viral re-suppression on the same regimen despite harbouring viruses with genotypic and phenotypic drug resistance. However, re-suppression was less durable in those with resistance, reinforcing the importance of appropriate regimen choices, ongoing viral load monitoring and adherence counselling.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234937;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

From this dataset 854 sequences were selected because they had associated values of CD4+ T lymphocytes counts and viral loads and they were used to assess the correlation between clinical parameters and hypermutation. We found that the frequency of stop codons at sites 5, 11 and 79 ranged from 2.8x10-4 to 4.2x10-4. On the other hand, at codons 21, 38, 70, 89 and 174 the frequency of stop codons ranged from 1.4x10-3 to 2.5x10-3. We also found a correlation between clinical parameters and hypermutation where patients harboring proviruses with one or more stop codons at the tryptophan sites of the gene vif had higher CD4+ T lymphocytes counts and lower viral loads compared to the population. Our findings indicate that A3 activity potentially restrains HIV-1 replication because individuals with hypermutated proviruses tend to have lower numbers of RNA copies. However, owing to the low frequency of hypermutated sequences observed in the databank (44 out of 7072), it is unlikely that A3 has a significant impact to curb HIV-1 dissemination at the population level.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225563;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

A CA-15L surrogate with hydrophilic residues, and its derivatives, in which amino acid sequences are shifted toward the C-terminus by one or more residues, were synthesized and their anti-HIV activity was evaluated.

We show that a chromosome periphery protein, CCDC137/cPERP-B, is targeted for depletion by HIV-1 Vpr, in a cullin4A-DDB1-DCAF1 dependent manner. CCDC137 depletion caused G2/M cellcycle arrest, while Vpr-resistant CCDC137 mutants conferred resistance to Vpr-induced G2/M arrest. CCDC137 depletion also recapitulated the ability of Vpr to enhance HIV-1 gene expression, particularly in macrophages.

Accordingly, ADCC and ADCP induced by anti-HIV envelope gp120 IgG have been correlated to the limited success of the HIV-1 phase III vaccine trial RV144. It remains elusive whether ADCP can also be triggered by IgA, the isotype predominant at mucosal surfaces through which HIV-1 is mainly transmitted. Yet, we have previously shown that the HIV envelope subunit gp41-specific broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5 under the IgA isotype (2F5-IgA) triggers ADCC and cooperates with 2F5-IgG to increase HIV-1-infected cell lysis. Here, we now demonstrate that 2F5-IgA, more efficiently than 2F5-IgG, induces ADCP not only of gp41-coated beads but also of primary HIV-1-infected cells in a FcRI-dependent manner. Both primary monocytes and neutrophils can act as effector cells of 2F5-IgA-mediated ADCP, although with different kinetics with faster neutrophil phagocytosis. However, unlike for ADCC, 2F5-IgA and 2F5-IgG do not cooperate to increase ADCP. Altogether, our results reveal that gp41-specific IgA mediate the efficient phagocytosis of HIV-1-infected cells. Inducing such ADCC and ADCP-prone IgA response by vaccination in addition to anti-HIV envelope IgG, might increase the protection against HIV acquisition at mucosal level.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01141/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;;;;

Furthermore, silencing AK130181 significantly reactivates viral production from HIV-1 latently infected Jurkat T cells and primary CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, we found that inhibition of AK130181 in resting CD4+ T cells from HIV-1-infected individuals treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy significantly increased viral reactivation upon T cell activation in vivo.

These results suggest that AK130181 is involved in HIV-1 latency by inhibiting LTR-driven HIV-1 gene transcription.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2162253120301190;7.5;6.6;7.7;;S2162253120301190;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2162253120301190;;

In this work, we report two of novel N-substituted pyrrolidine at C-8 position of quinolone derivatives 18 and 19, their synthesis under microwave technique, spectral methods, molecular docking study and anti-HIV activities. Docking study exhibited hydrogen bonding, polar, and Van der Waals interactions with the active site residues of HER2 target. The binding energy and hydrogen bonding interactions show that synthesized compounds are being considered to have a potential activity against breast cancer. In addition, quinolone derivatives were evaluated in vitro for antiviral activity against the replication of HIV-1 and HIV-2 in MT-4 cells.

Here, we studied how VRC01 infusions affected viral rebound after cessation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 18 acutely treated and durably suppressed individuals. Viral rebound occurred in all individuals, yet VRC01 infusions modestly delayed rebound and participants who showed a faster decay of VRC01 in serum rebounded more rapidly. Participants with strains most sensitive to VRC01 or with VRC01 epitope motifs similar to known VRC01-susceptible strains rebounded later. Upon rebound, HIV-1 sequences were indistinguishable from those sampled at diagnosis. Across the cohort, participant-derived Env showed different sensitivity to VRC01 neutralization (including 2 resistant viruses), yet neutralization sensitivity was similar at diagnosis and after rebound, indicating the lack of selection for VRC01 resistance during treatment interruption. Our results showed that viremia rebounded despite the absence of HIV-1 adaptation to VRC01 and an average VRC01 trough of 221 g/mL. Although VRC01 levels were insufficient to prevent a resurgent infection, knowledge that they did not mediate Env mutations in acute-like viruses is relevant for antibody-based strategies in acute infection.;https://www.jci.org/articles/view/134395;21.2;19.0;17.0;00219738;;;;

Bictegravir is highly bound to plasma proteins, and this significantly determines its clearance, solubility, and activity. These characteristics are crucial determinants of bictegravir penetration into human body compartments, as the central nervous system. We developed and validated UHPLC-MS/MS procedures to measure total and unbound bictegravir concentrations in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Simple protein precipitation with acetonitrile was implemented to prepare plasma and cerebrospinal fluid samples. Sample preparation was preceded by ultrafiltration for measuring unbound bictegravir concentrations. Chromatographic separations were achieved on an Acquity® UHPLC® BEHTM (2.1 × 100 mm id, 1.7 m) reverse-phase C18 column using an isocratic mobile phase 20:80 (v/v) water/acetonitrile with 0.1% formic. Bictegravir and its internal standard (bictegravir-15N d2) were detected by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in positive and multiple reaction monitoring modes, using transitions of 450.2289.2/145.4 and 453.2289.2, respectively. Ultrafiltration procedures presented non-specific bindings of (8.6 ± 1.2) % for bictegravir in plasma and (26.6 ± 3.1) % for bictegravir in cerebrospinal fluid.

Membrane binding by the Gag protein of HIV-1 and most other lentiviruses is dependent on N-terminal myristoylation of MA by host N-myristoyltransferase enzymes (NMTs), which recognize a six-residue “myristoylation signal” with consensus sequence: M1GXXX[ST]. For unknown reasons, the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), which infects both domestic and wild cats, encodes a non-consensus myristoylation sequence not utilized by its host or by other mammals (most commonly: M1GNGQG). To explore the evolutionary basis for this sequence, we compared the structure, dynamics, and myristoylation properties of native FIV MA with a mutant protein containing a consensus feline myristoylation motif (MANOS) and examined the impact of MA mutations on virus assembly and ability to support spreading infection. Unexpectedly, myristoylation efficiency of MANOS in Escherichia coli by co-expressed mammalian NMT was reduced by ~ 70% compared to the wild-type protein. NMR studies revealed that residues of the N-terminal myristoylation signal are fully exposed and mobile in the native protein but partially sequestered in the MANOS chimera, suggesting that the unusual FIV sequence is conserved to promote exposure and efficient myristoylation of the MA N terminus. In contrast, virus assembly studies indicate that the MANOS mutation does not affect virus assembly, but does prevent virus spread, in feline kidney cells. Our findings indicate that residues of the FIV myristoylation sequence play roles in replication beyond NMT recognition and Gag–membrane binding.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022283620303491;8.8;8.7;9.1;00222836;S0022283620303491;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0022283620303491;;

About 41.3% of NCp7 remained soluble after incubated at 100 °C for 60 min, and heat-treated NCp7 maintained its abilities to bind to HIV-1 packaging signal (Psi) and the stem-loop 3 of the Psi. At high or very high degrees of sequence occupancy, NCp7 inhibited first-strand cDNA synthesis catalyzed by purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and heat-treated NCp7 maintained the inhibition. Moreover, both EDTA-treated and H23K + H44K double mutant of NCp7 inhibited first-strand cDNA synthesis, demonstrating that the NA-binding activity of NCp7 at high NC:NA ratios is independent on its zinc-fingers.

This work explores the mechanisms of MxB-mediated HIV-1 inhibition. Results: We demonstrated that MxB represses NUP358-mediated PIC nuclear import and HIV-1 replication. Moreover, MxB's effects on PIC nuclear import and HIV-1 replication depend critically on cofactor cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 6 (CPSF6). MxB binds nucleoporin NUP358, blocks NUP358-CA interaction, thereby impeding the nuclear import of HIV-1 PIC with CPSF6 binding to PIC. More intriguingly, CPSF6's role in nuclear import depends on MxB, being a facilitator of HIV-1 nuclear import on its own, but becoming an inhibitor when MxB is present. Conclusions: Our work establishes that MxB impedes the NUP358-mediated HIV-1 nuclear import and viral replication cooperatively with CPSF6.;https://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12977-020-00524-2;7.3;6.7;6.7;;;;;

We sought to determine whether a community-based intervention to identify and rapidly treat people living with HIV, and support male circumcision could increase population levels of HIV diagnosis, treatment, viral suppression, and male circumcision in Botswana. Methods: The Ya Tsie Botswana Combination Prevention Project study was a pair-matched cluster-randomised trial done in 30 communities across Botswana done from Oct 30, 2013, to June 30, 2018. 15 communities were randomly assigned to receive HIV prevention and treatment interventions, including enhanced HIV testing, earlier antiretroviral therapy (ART), and strengthened male circumcision services, and 15 received standard of care. The first primary endpoint of HIV incidence has already been reported. In this Article, we report findings for the second primary endpoint of population uptake of HIV prevention services, as measured by proportion of people known to be HIV-positive or tested HIV-negative in the preceding 12 months; proportion of people living with HIV diagnosed and on ART; proportion of people living with HIV on ART with viral suppression; and proportion of HIV-negative men circumcised. A longitudinal cohort of residents aged 16–64 years from a random, approximately 20% sample of households across the 15 communities was enrolled to assess baseline uptake of study outcomes; we also administered an end-of-study survey to all residents not previously enrolled in the longitudinal cohort to provide study end coverage estimates. Differences in intervention uptake over time by randomisation group were tested via paired Student's t test. The study has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01965470). Findings: In the six communities participating in the end-of-study survey, 2625 residents (n=1304 from standard-of-care communities, n=1321 from intervention communities) were enrolled into the 20% longitudinal cohort at baseline from Oct 30, 2013, to Nov 24, 2015. In the same communities, 10 791 (86%) of 12 489 eligible enumerated residents not previously enrolled in the longitudinal cohort participated in the end-of-study survey from March 30, 2017, to Feb 25, 2018 (5896 in intervention and 4895 in standard-of-care communities). At study end, in intervention communities, 1228 people living with HIV (91% of 1353) were on ART; 1166 people living with HIV (88% of 1321 with available viral load) were virally suppressed, and 673 HIV-negative men (40% of 1673) were circumcised in intervention communities. After accounting for baseline differences, at study end the proportion of people living with HIV who were diagnosed was significantly higher in intervention communities (absolute increase of 9% to 93%) compared with standard-of-care communities (absolute increase of 2% to 88%; prevalence ratio [PR] 1·08 [95% CI 1·02–1·14], p=0·032). Population levels of ART, viral suppression, and male circumcision increased from baseline in both groups, with greater increases in intervention communities (ART PR 1·12 [95% CI 1·07–1·17], p=0·018; viral suppression 1·13 [1·09–1·17], p=0·017; male circumcision 1·26 [1·17–1·35], p=0·029). Interpretation: It is possible to achieve very high population levels of HIV testing and treatment in a high-prevalence setting. Maintaining these coverage levels over the next decade could substantially reduce HIV transmission and potentially eliminate the epidemic in these areas.

In this study, we examined a subset (n = 275) of sequences from Rakai, Uganda, collected between August 2011 and January 2015. Sequences were initially screened with COMET for subtyping and then evaluated using bootscanning and phylogenetic inference. Among 275 sequences, 38.6% were subtype D, 19.3% were subtype A, 2.9% were subtype C, and 39.3% were recombinant. The recombinants were structurally diverse in the number of breakpoints observed, the location of recombinant segments, and represented subtypes, with AD recombinants accounting for the majority of all recombinants (29.8%). Within the AD subpopulation, we identified a potential new circulating recombinant form in five individuals where the polymerase gene was subtype D and most of env was subtype A (D-A junctures at HXB2 6760 and 8709). While the breakpoints were identical for the viruses from these individuals, the viral fragments did not cluster together. These results suggest selection for a viral strain where properties of the subtype A and subtype D portions of the virus confer a survival advantage. The continued study of recombinants will increase our breadth of knowledge for the genetic diversity and evolution of HIV-1, which can further contribute to our understanding toward a universal HIV-1 vaccine.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2019.0150;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;;

In untreated infections, immune activation increases the turnover of intrinsically long-lived provirus-containing CD4+ T cells. Those are ‘washed out’ as a result of their activation, which when coupled to viral protein expression can facilitate local inflammation and recruitment of uninfected cells to activation sites, causing latently infected cells to compete for survival. De novo infection can counter this washout. During ART, inflammation and CD4+ T cell activation wane, resulting in reduced cell turnover and a persistent reservoir. We propose accelerating reservoir washout during ART by triggering sequential waves of polyclonal CD4+ T cell activation while simultaneously enhancing virus protein expression. Reservoir reduction as an adjunct to other therapies might achieve lifelong viral control.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1471490620300685;23.0;23.1;21.5;14714906;S1471490620300685;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1471490620300685;;

Because retroviruses of different morphogenetic types assemble their immature particles in distinct regions of the host cell, the mechanism of MA-mediated plasma membrane targeting differs among distinct retroviral morphogenetic types. Here, we focused on possible mechanistic differences of the MA-mediated plasma membrane targeting of the B-type mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) and C-type HIV-1, which assemble in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations, together with surface mapping, indicated that, similarly to HIV-1, MMTV uses a myristic switch to anchor the MA to the membrane and electrostatically interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to stabilize MA orientation. We observed that the affinity of MMTV MA to the membrane is lower than that of HIV-1 MA, possibly related to their different topologies and the number of basic residues in the highly basic MA region. The latter probably reflects the requirement of C-type retroviruses for tighter membrane binding, essential for assembly, unlike for D/B-type retroviruses, which assemble in the cytoplasm. A comparison of the membrane topology of the HIV-1 MA, using the surface-mapping method and molecular dynamics simulations, revealed that the residues at the HIV-1 MA C terminus help stabilize protein-protein interactions within the HIV-1 MA lattice at the plasma membrane. In summary, HIV-1 and MMTV share common features such as membrane binding of the MA via hydrophobic interactions and exhibit several differences, including lower membrane affinity of MMTV MA.;http://www.jbc.org/lookup/doi/10.1074/jbc.RA119.011991;8.2;7.7;7.4;;;;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.HIV-1 CRF07_BC is a B’ and C subtype recombinant emerging virus and many of its viral characteristics remain unclear. Galectin-3 (Gal3) is a -galactose binding lectin that has been reported as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and is known to mediate adhesion between cells and microbes. This study aims to examine the viral characteristics of HIV-1 CRF07_BC virus and the role of extracellular galectin-3 in HIV-1 CRF07_BC infection. A total of 28 HIV-1+ injecting drug users (IDUs) were recruited and 24 (85.7%) were identified as HIV-1 CRF07_BC. Results indicate that significant higher serum galectin-3 was measured in CRF07_BC infected patients and CRF07_BC infection triggered significant galectin-3 expression (p < 0.01). Viral characteristics demonstrate that CRF07_BC virions display a higher level of envelope gp120 spikes. The virus infectivity assay demonstrated that co-treatment with galectin-3 significantly promoted CRF07_BC attachment and internalization (p < 0.01). A co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that pulldown galectin-3 co-precipitated both CD4 and gp120 proteins. Results from an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) indicate that the galectin-3 promoting effect occurs through enhancement of the interaction between gp120 and CD4. This study suggests that CRF07_BC was predominant in HIV-1+ IDUs and CRF07_BC utilized extracellular galectin-3 to enhance its infectivity via stabilization of the gp120-CD4 interaction.;https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/9/6/425;5.3;5.0;3.1;;;;;

Latent reservoirs throughout the body are a major hurdle when it comes to eradicating the virus. In our previous study, we found that exosomes, a type of extracellular vesicle (EV), from uninfected cells activate the transcription of HIV-1 in latent infected cells, regardless of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). In this study, we investigated the specific mechanism behind the EV activation of latent HIV-1. We found that phosphorylated c-Src is present in EVs of various cell lines and has the ability to activate downstream proteins such as EGFR, initiating a signal cascade. EGFR is then able to activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, resulting in the activation of STAT3 and SRC-1, culminating in the reversal of HIV-1 latency. This was verified by examining levels of HIV-1 TAR, genomic RNA and HIV-1 Gag p24 protein in cell lines and primary cells. We found that EVs containing c-Src rescued HIV-1 despite the presence of inhibitors, validating the importance of EV-associated c-Src in latent HIV-1 activation. Lastly, we discovered an increased recruitment of p300 and NF-B in the nucleus of EV-treated infected cells. Collectively, our data suggest that EV-associated c-Src is able to activate latent HIV-1 via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and SRC-1/p300-driven chromatin remodeling. These findings could aid in designing new strategies to prevent the reactivation of latent HIV-1 in patients under cART.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/6/665;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

The HIV-1 capsid is the key determinant of MxB sensitivity and cofactor binding defective HIV-1 capsid mutants P90A (defective for cyclophilin A and Nup358 recruitment) and N74D (defective for CPSF6 recruitment) have reduced dependency on nuclear transport associated cofactors, altered integration targeting preferences and are not restricted by MxB expression. This has suggested that nuclear import mechanism may determine MxB sensitivity. Here we have use genetics to separate HIV-1 nuclear import cofactor dependence from MxB sensitivity. We provide evidence that MxB sensitivity depends on HIV-1 capsid conformation, rather than cofactor recruitment. We show that depleting CPSF6 to change nuclear import pathway does not impact MxB sensitivity, but mutants that recapitulate the effect of Cyclophilin A binding on capsid conformation and dynamics strongly impact MxB sensitivity. We demonstrate that HIV-1 primary isolates have different MxB sensitivities due to cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) selected differences in Gag sequence but similar cofactor dependencies. Overall our work demonstrates a complex relationship between cyclophilin dependence and MxB sensitivity likely driven by CTL escape. We propose that cyclophilin binding provides conformational flexibility to HIV-1 capsid facilitating simultaneous evasion of capsid-targeting restriction factors including TRIM5 as well as MxB.;https://elifesciences.org/articles/56910;10.0;10.8;10.8;;;;;

All Rights Reserved.Compartmentalization of HIV-1 between the systemic circulation and the male genital tract may have a substantial impact on which viruses are available for sexual transmission to new hosts. We studied compartmentalization and clonal amplification of HIV-1 populations between the blood and the genital tract from 10 antiretroviral-naive men using Illumina MiSeq with a PrimerID approach. We found evidence of some degree of compartmentalization in every study participant, unlike previous studies, which collectively showed that only 50% of analyzed individuals exhibited compartmentalization of HIV-1 lineages between the male genital tract (MGT) and blood. Using down-sampling simulations, we determined that this disparity can be explained by differences in sampling depth in that had we sequenced to a lower depth, we would also have found compartmentalization in only 50% of the study participants. For most study participants, phylogenetic trees were rooted in blood, suggesting that the male genital tract reservoir is seeded by incoming variants from the blood. Clonal amplification was observed in all study participants and was a characteristic of both blood and semen viral populations. We also show evidence for independent viral replication in the genital tract in the individual with the most severely compartmentalized HIV-1 populations. The degree of clonal amplification was not obviously associated with the extent of compartmentalization. We were also unable to detect any association between history of sexually transmitted infections and level of HIV-1 compartmentalization. Overall, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics that affect the composition of virus populations that are available for transmission. IMPORTANCE Within an individual living with HIV-1, factors that restrict the movement of HIV-1 between different compartments-such as between the blood and the male genital tract-could strongly influence which viruses reach sites in the body from which they can be transmitted. Using deep sequencing, we found strong evidence of restricted HIV-1 movements between the blood and genital tract in all 10 men that we studied. We additionally found that neither the degree to which particular genetic variants of HIV-1 proliferate (in blood or genital tract) nor an individual's history of sexually transmitted infections detectably influenced the degree to which virus movements were restricted between the blood and genital tract. Last, we show evidence that viral replication gave rise to a large clonal amplification in semen in a donor with highly compartmentalized HIV-1 populations, raising the possibility that differential selection of HIV-1 variants in the genital tract may occur.;http://jvi.asm.org/lookup/doi/10.1128/JVI.00229-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

Bacterium-like particles (BLPs) are a new type of vector used to induce mucosal immune responses, and have already been used for some vaccines against respiratory tract viruses. In this study, we designed a mucosal vaccine against HIV-1 based on BLPs. The vaccine was used to immunize both mice and guinea pigs via intramuscular (i.m.) injection or intranasal (i.n.) drip. We found that gp120 trimers bound to BLPs delivered via i.n. drip successfully induced Env-specific secretory IgA (sIgA) at mucosal sites in mice. Furthermore, nasal washes from guinea pigs immunized via i.n. drip showed neutralizing activity against HIV-1 tier 1 pseudoviruses.

It has also been shown to disrupt the mTORC1 signaling pathway. The replication of many viruses requires mTORC1 activation. Here, we investigated the inhibitory activity of niclosamide against HIV-1, and determined whether mTORC1 inhibition was involved. The cytotoxicity and anti-HIV-1 activity of niclosamide were tested in TZM-bl and SupT1 cells. Niclosamide showed a dose- and time-dependent inhibitory activity against HIV-1 replication, but the inhibition did not involve the reverse transcription and transcription steps. The mechanism of mTORC1 inhibition was explored by using MHY1485, an mTORC1 activator, to reverse the mTORC1 inhibition, which could partially restore HIV-1 replication. In addition, niclosamide was found to downregulate mTORC1 via AMPK activation, resulting in a decreased phosphorylation of the downstream substrates of S6K and 4EBP1. Niclosamide could also reduce the synthesis of HIV-1 p24 protein. Likewise, MHY-1485 could partially reverse the inhibitory effect of niclosamide by increasing the phosphorylation in the mTORC1 pathway and HIV-1 viral protein synthesis. Our findings, therefore, demonstrated the antiviral mechanism of niclosamide is via the AMPK-mTORC1 pathway, which could be a common therapeutic target for various viruses.© 2020 The Author(s)Microbiology; Cell biology; Virology; Molecular biology; Biomolecules; Niclosamide; HIV-1; mTorC1; AMPK";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S240584402030894X;0.7;1.1;1.2;24058440;S240584402030894X;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S240584402030894X;;

The Aptima HIV-1 Quant Dx Assay on the Panther platform (Panther) is the first commercially available test that is CE-marked for both HIV-1 diagnosis and monitoring, but only FDA-cleared for HIV-1 monitoring. Objective: To evaluate the Panther assay for use as a qualitative and quantitative HIV-1 assay in a pediatric population, including patients younger than 24 months old, and review its effect on laboratory efficiency and hands-on-time following its implementation. Study Design: 100 patient specimens previously tested on the Abbott m2000 RealTime HIV-1 assay (RealTime) and 185 patient specimens previously tested on the Aptima HIV-1 RNA Qualitative Assay (RNA Qual) were tested on the Panther. Verification panels were used to establish precision and linearity. In addition, 268 samples from 134 patients under 24 months of age were also evaluated on the Panther. Results: Overall agreement between the Panther and RealTime assays was 83 %. The mean difference between the two methods was 0.10 Log copies/mL. All Panther measurements were linear across the dynamic range (R2 = 0.999). The Panther and RNA Qual assays showed 100 % agreement. Implementation of the assay opened 600 sq. ft. of space, saved 0.4 FTE and reduced hands-on-time by 70 %. Conclusions: The Panther assay is an excellent option for HIV-1 qualitative detection and quantitative testing in pediatric patients, including those under 24 months of age.

Schistosomiasis is hypothesized to increase HIV-1 acquisition risk, and multiple cross-sectional studies reported strong associations. We evaluated this hypothesis within four large prospective cohorts. Methods: We conducted nested case-control analyses within three longitudinal cohorts of heterosexual HIV-1 serodiscordant couples and one female sex worker (FSW) cohort from Kenya and Uganda. The serodiscordant couples studies were conducted between 2004 and 2012 while the FSW cohort analysis included participant follow-up from 1993 to 2014. Cases HIV-1 seroconverted during prospective follow-up; three controls were selected per case. The presence of circulating anodic antigen in archived serum, collected prior to HIV-1 seroconversion, identified participants with active schistosomiasis; immunoblots determined the schistosome species. Data from serodiscordant couples cohorts were pooled, while the FSW cohort was analysed separately to permit appropriate confounder adjustment. Results: We included 245 HIV-1 seroconverters and 713 controls from the serodiscordant couples cohorts and 330 HIV-1 seroconverters and 962 controls from the FSW cohort. The prevalence of active schistosomiasis was 20% among serodiscordant couples and 22% among FSWs. We found no association between schistosomiasis and HIV-1 acquisition risk among males (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.99, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.67) or females (aOR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.30) in serodiscordant couples. Similarly, in the FSW cohort we detected no association (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) = 1.11, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.50). Exploring schistosome species-specific effects, there was no statistically significant association between HIV-1 acquisition risk and Schistosoma mansoni (serodiscordant couples: aOR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.44; FSW: aIRR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.20) or Schistosoma haematobium (serodiscordant couples: aOR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.40; FSW: aIRR = 1.64, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.87) infection. Conclusions: Schistosomiasis was not a strong risk factor for HIV-1 acquisition in these four prospective studies. S. mansoni was responsible for the majority of schistosomiasis in these cohorts, and our results do not support the hypothesis that S. mansoni infection is associated with increased HIV-1 acquisition risk. S. haematobium infection was associated with a point estimate of elevated HIV-1 risk in the FSW cohort that was not statistically significant, and there was no trend towards a positive association in the serodiscordant couples cohorts.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jia2.25534;5.5;6.7;7.1;;;;;

Secondary distribution of HIV self-tests by women to their male partners is a promising approach for increasing male testing that is being implemented in several countries. Here, we examine male partner and couples testing outcomes and sexual decision making associated with this approach in a cluster randomized trial. Methods: We examined data from women at higher risk of HIV participating in the intervention arm of an ongoing pair-matched cluster randomized trial in Kenya. HIV-negative women 18 years who self-reported 2 partners in the past month were eligible. Participants received self-tests at enrolment and three-monthly intervals. They were encouraged to offer tests to sexual partners with whom they anticipated condomless sex. At six months, we collected data on self-test distribution, male partner and couples testing, and testing and sexual behaviour in the three most recent transactional sex encounters. We used descriptive analyses and generalized estimating equation models to understand how sexual behaviour was influenced by self-test distribution. Results: From January 2018 to April 2019, 921/1057 (87%) participants completed six-month follow-up. Average age was 28 years, 65% were married, and 72% reported income through sex work. Participants received 7283 self-tests over six months, a median of eight per participant. Participants offered a median three self-tests to sexual partners. Of participants with a primary partner, 94% offered them a self-test. Of these, 97% accepted the test. When accepted, couples testing was reported among 91% of participants. Among 1954 transactional sex encounters, 64% included an offer to self-test. When offered self-tests were accepted by 93% of partners, and 84% who accepted conducted couples testing. Compared to partners with an HIV-negative result, condom use was higher when men had a reactive result (56.3% vs. 89.7%, p < 0.01), were not offered a self-test (56.3% vs. 62.0%, p = 0.02), or refused to self-test (56.3% vs. 78.3, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Providing women with multiple self-tests facilitated male partner and couples testing, and led to safer sexual behaviour. These findings suggest secondary distribution is a promising approach for reaching men and has HIV prevention potential.

This virus attacks by interacting between HIV-1 proteins and human proteins. This study used data in the form of amino acid sequences of proteins to be selected and then changed its features using global encoding. Then the feature extraction results will be used as input for the k-nearest neighbor models and weighted k-nearest neighbor models to predict the interaction of HIV proteins with human proteins. In addition, this study also compared the evaluation of the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and weighted k-nearest neighbor (WKNN) models. Then both models are given Manhattan distance and Euclidean distance. The results of this study indicate that the best model is WKNN model with Manhattan distance using parameter global encoding (L = 2) and parameter model (K = 2), obtained the highest evaluation results in predicting the interaction of HIV proteins with human proteins, with accuracy reaching 93.78 %, sensitivity reaching 93.58 %, specificity reaching 94.01 % and precision reaching 95.78 %. Also in this study 193 proteins from 6,046 human proteins were found interacted with HIV-1 and 5853 human proteins from predictive datasets that did not interact with HIV-1.;http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/5.0010738;0.4;0.5;0.6;0094243X;;;true;9780735420014

However, a small previous trial of such therapy with dolutegravir in healthy, HIV-negative adults was halted early after two of the four patients developed serious adverse events. Because of the potential use of this therapy, and variable safety outcomes of tuberculosis drugs seen in patients with and without HIV, we aimed to characterise safety, pharmacokinetics, and virological suppression in adults who are HIV positive. Methods: DOLPHIN was a phase 1/2, single-arm trial done at The Aurum Institute (Tembisa Clinical Research Site, Tembisa, South Africa), with pharmacokinetic visits done at VxPharma (Pretoria, South Africa). Adults (18 years) with HIV infection and undetectable viral load (<40 copies per mL) after at least 8 weeks of efavirenz-based or dolutegravir-based regimens were recruited in three consecutive groups, subject to approval by the independent safety monitoring committee. Participants received 50 mg of daily dolutegravir in place of efavirenz for 8 weeks, then began once-weekly rifapentine (900 mg)–isoniazid (900 mg) for 12 weeks. Groups 1A (n=12) and 1B (n=18) had intensive dolutegravir pharmacokinetic sampling at week 8 (before rifapentine–isoniazid), at week 11 (after the third dose of rifapentine)–isoniazid and at week 16 after the eighth dose. Group 2 (n=30) were treated with the same schedule and had sparse dolutegravir pharmacokinetic sampling at weeks 8, 11, and 16. Participants were followed 4 weeks after completion of prophylactic tuberculosis treatment. HIV viral loads were measured at baseline and at weeks 11 and 24. Primary endpoints were adverse events (grade 3 or higher) and dolutegravir population pharmacokinetics, assessed in participants who began rifapentine–isoniazid. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03435146. Findings: Between Jan 24, 2018, and Nov 25, 2018, 61 participants were enrolled into three groups; one participant withdrew (from group 1A). 43 (70%) of 60 participants were women and all participants were black African. Median age was 40 years (IQR 35–48), CD4 cell count was 683 cells per L (447–935), and body-mass index was 28·9 kg/m2 (24·0–32·9). Three grade 3 adverse events occurred; two elevated creatinine and one hypertension. Rifapentine–isoniazid increased dolutegravir clearance by 36% (relative standard error 13%) resulting in a 26% decrease in dolutegravir area under the curve. Overall geometric mean ratio of trough concentrations with versus without rifapentine–isoniazid was 0·53 (90% CI 0·49–0·56) though this ratio varied by day after rifapentine–isoniazid dose. All but one trough value was above the 90% maximal inhibitory concentration for dolutegravir and HIV viral loads were less than 40 copies per mL in all patients. Interpretation: Our results suggest 12 doses of once-weekly rifapentine–isoniazid can be given for tuberculosis prophylaxis to patients with HIV taking dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy, without dose adjustments. Further exploration of the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy in children and pharmacodynamics in individuals naive to antiretroviral therapy is needed.

Under constant stress pressure, mutations can lead to the emergence of unwanted, drug-resistant entities. Methodology: The radial distribution function weighted by the number of valence shell electrons is used to design quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model relating descriptors with the inhibition constant for a series of wild-type HIV-1 protease inhibitor complexes. The residuals of complexes with mutant HIV-1 protease were correlated with the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbitals of the residues introduced to enzyme via point mutations.

This analysis examines experiences of violence victimization, and the perpetrators of this violence, among AYA living with HIV, aged 15–24 years, in Zambia. Methods We analyzed baseline data from 272 AYA (60.1% female, 71.0% perinatally infected) enrolled in Project YES! (Youth Engaging for Success), a randomized controlled trial conducted in four HIV clinics in Ndola, Zambia. Violence measures were adapted from the ICAST-C and the WHO Multi-Country Study on Women’s Health and Domestic Violence. Youth could report up to 12 perpetrator types for past-year experiences of violence. We estimated lifetime and past-year prevalence of physical violence, psychological abuse, and forced sex, disaggregated by sex and age group. Estimates were weighted using sex and age data from the 2013–14 Zambian Demographic and Health Survey to be representative of HIV-positive AYA in Zambia. Results Estimated lifetime prevalence of any violence victimization was 78.2%. Past-year prevalence was 72.0% among males and 74.5% among females. Almost half of AYA (46.1%) had ever experienced polyvictimization (2+ types of violence). Psychological abuse was most common (70.4% lifetime, 65.3% past-year), followed by physical violence (50.8% lifetime, 44.7% past-year) and forced sex (10.4% lifetime, 4.7% past-year). Among past-year victims, males experienced more violence than females from a friend/peer (74.3% vs. 45.1%, p<0.001); females experienced more violence than males from a romantic partner (33.3% vs. 5.0%, p<0.001), parent/caregiver (32.4% vs. 17.6%, p = 0.02), and stranger (19.7% vs. 5.2%, p<0.001). Conclusion The widespread and overlapping prevalence of multiple types of violence highlights the critical need for prevention and response efforts that are tailored to youths’ sex and the perpetrator type. Future research should explore violence victimization and HIV outcomes, and the measurement of psychological abuse and sexual violence, among HIV-positive AYA in the region.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235203;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

We assessed whether Padina tetrastromatica Hauck will possess the immune stimulatory and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) inhibitory activity. Aqueous and methanolic extracts were tested for the Th1/Th2 cytokines using PBMC. Subsequently, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), nitric oxide (NO) and anti-oxidant effect were analyzed using RAW264.7 cells. In addition, Padina extracts were tested for the HIV-1 clade C & A by measuring the levels of viral p24 antigen in infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and against reverse transcriptase (RT). At 100g/mL, aqueous and methanolic extracts produced a significant amount of IL-10 and IFN-at 24h and 72h post-stimulation by PBMCs. It also produced a significant amount of LTB4, NO and had an antioxidant effect on RAW264.7 cell, suggesting the immune stimulating potential of P. tetrastromatica. Upon infection of PBMCs with 100 TCID50, aqueous and methanolic extracts of P. tetrastromatica inhibited HIV-1 C (>90%) and HIV-1 A (>50%) showed a significant reduction in HIV-1 p24 levels and HIV-1 RT inhibition (>50%). GC-MS study revealed a relative abundance of tetradecanoic and oleic acid in the methanolic extract of P. tetrastromatica, which might be responsible for immune stimulation and anti-HIV-1 activity. At lower concentrations (100mg/mL), the aqueous and methanolic extracts of P. tetrastromatica showed the strong immune stimulation and greatest anti-HIV-1 potential in vitro.

The molecular mechanisms involved in intracellular transport of HIV-1 are not yet fully defined. We demonstrate that the actin-binding protein lymphocyte-specific protein 1 (LSP1) interacts with the interferon-inducible protein bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST-2) in dendritic cells (DCs) to facilitate both endocytosis of surface-bound HIV-1 and the formation of early endosomes. Analysis of the molecular interaction between LSP1 and BST-2 reveals that the N terminus of LSP1 interacts with BST-2. Overall, we identify a novel mechanism of intracellular trafficking of HIV-1 in DCs centering on the LSP1/BST-2 complex. We also show that the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu subverts this pathway by inducing proteasomal degradation of LSP1, augmenting cell–cell transmission of HIV-1.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1873-3468.13788;9.3;8.0;5.6;00145793;;;;

Viral proteins, including Tat, released from infected cells, cause neuronal toxicity. Substance abuse in HIV-infected patients greatly influences the severity of neuronal damage. To repurpose small molecule inhibitors for anti-HAND therapy, we employed MOLIERE, an AI-based literature mining system that we developed. All human genes were analyzed and prioritized by MOLIERE to find previously unknown targets connected to HAND. From the identified high priority genes, we narrowed the list to those with known small molecule ligands developed for other applications and lacking systemic toxicity in animal models. To validate the AI-based process, the selective small molecule inhibitor of DDX3 helicase activity, RK-33, was chosen and tested for neuroprotective activity. The compound, previously developed for cancer treatment, was tested for the prevention of combined neurotoxicity of HIV Tat and cocaine. Rodent cortical cultures were treated with 6 or 60 ng/ml of HIV Tat and 10 or 25 M of cocaine, which caused substantial toxicity. RK-33 at doses as low as 1 M greatly reduced the neurotoxicity of Tat and cocaine. Transcriptome analysis showed that most Tat-activated transcripts are microglia-specific genes and that RK-33 blocks their activation. Treatment with RK-33 inhibits the Tat and cocaine-dependent increase in the number and size of microglia and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-, MCP-1/CCL2, MIP-2, IL-1 and IL-1. These findings reveal that inhibition of DDX3 may have the potential to treat not only HAND but other neurodegenerative diseases.

Recent structural studies have shown that sequences near the 5 end of HIV-1 RNA can adopt at least two alternate three-dimensional conformations, and that these structures dictate genome versus unspliced mRNA fates. HIV-1’s use of alternate transcription start sites (TSS) can influence which RNA conformer is generated, and this choice, in turn, dictates the fate of the unspliced RNA. The structural context of HIV-1’s major 5 splice site differs in these two RNA conformers, suggesting that the conformers may differ in their ability to support HIV-1 splicing events. Here, we tested the hypothesis that TSS that shift the RNA monomer/dimer structural equilibrium away from the splice site sequestering dimer-competent fold would favor splicing. Consistent with this hypothesis, the results showed that the 5 ends of spliced HIV-1 RNAs were enriched in 3GCap structures and depleted of 1GCap RNAs relative to the total intracellular RNA population. These findings expand the functional significance of HIV-1 RNA structural dynamics by demonstrating roles for RNA structure in defining all three classes of HIV-1 RNAs, and suggest that HIV-1 TSS choice initiates a cascade of molecular events that dictate the fates of nascent HIV-1 RNAs.;http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/lookup/doi/10.1261/rna.073650.119;7.6;6.9;7.1;13558382;;;;

In this study, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of shorter, simpler regimens of trivalent Ad26.Mos.HIV expressing mosaic HIV-1 Env/Gag/Pol antigens combined with aluminium phosphate-adjuvanted clade C gp140 protein. Methods: We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 trial (IPCAVD010/HPX1002) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA, USA. We included healthy, HIV-uninfected participants (aged 18–50 years) who were considered at low risk for HIV infection and had not received any vaccines in the 14 days before study commencement. We randomly assigned participants via a computer-generated randomisation schedule and interactive web response system to one of three study groups (1:1:1) testing different regimens of trivalent Ad26.Mos.HIV (5 × 1010 viral particles per 0·5 mL) combined with 250 g adjuvanted clade C gp140 protein. They were then assigned to treatment or placebo subgroups (5:1) within each of the three main groups. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation until the end of the follow-up period. Group 1 received Ad26.Mos.HIV alone at weeks 0 and 12 and Ad26.Mos.HIV plus adjuvanted gp140 at weeks 24 and 48. Group 2 received Ad26.Mos.HIV plus adjuvanted gp140 at weeks 0, 12, and 24. Group 3 received Ad26.Mos.HIV alone at week 0 and Ad26.Mos.HIV plus adjuvanted gp140 at weeks 8 and 24. Participants in the control group received 0·5 mL of 0·9% saline. All study interventions were administered intramuscularly. The primary endpoints were Env-specific binding antibody responses at weeks 28, 52, and 72 and safety and tolerability of the vaccine regimens for 28 days after the injection. All participants who received at least one vaccine dose or placebo were included in the safety analysis; immunogenicity was analysed using the per-protocol population. The IPCAVD010/HPX1002 trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02685020. We also did a parallel preclinical study in rhesus monkeys to test the protective efficacy of the shortened group 3 regimen. Findings: Between March 7, 2016, and Aug 19, 2016, we randomly assigned 36 participants to receive at least one dose of study vaccine or placebo, ten to each vaccine group and two to the corresponding placebo group. 30 (83%) participants completed the full study, and six (17%) discontinued it prematurely because of loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, investigator decision, and an unrelated death from a motor vehicle accident. The two shortened regimens elicited comparable antibody titres against autologous clade C Env at peak immunity to the longer, 12-month regimen: geometric mean titre (GMT) 41 007 (95% CI 17 959–93 636) for group 2 and 49 243 (29 346–82 630) for group 3 at week 28 compared with 44 590 (19 345–102 781) for group 1 at week 52). Antibody responses remained increased (GMT >5000) in groups 2 and 3 at week 52 but were highest in group 1 at week 72. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, Env-specific IgG3, tier 1A neutralising activity, and broad cellular immune responses were detected in all groups. All vaccine regimens were well tolerated. Mild-to-moderate pain or tenderness at the injection site was the most commonly reported solicited local adverse event, reported by 28 vaccine recipients (93%) and two placebo recipients (33%). Grade 3 solicited systemic adverse events were reported by eight (27%) vaccine recipients and no placebo recipients; the most commonly reported grade 3 systemic symptoms were fatigue, myalgia, and chills. The shortened group 3 regimen induced comparable peak immune responses in 30 rhesus monkeys as in humans and resulted in an 83% (95% CI 38·7–95, p=0·004 log-rank test) reduction in per-exposure acquisition risk after six intrarectal challenges with SHIV-SF162P3 at week 54, more than 6 months after final vaccination. Interpretation: Short, 6-month regimens of a mosaic HIV-1 prophylactic vaccine elicited robust HIV-specific immune responses that were similar to responses elicited by a longer, 12-month schedule. Preclinical data showed partial protective efficacy of one of the short vaccine regimens in rhesus monkeys. Further clinical studies are required to test the suitability of the shortened vaccine regimens in humans. Such shortened regimens would be valuable to increase vaccine delivery at the community level, particularly in resource-limited settings.

We report the association between HIV-1 DNA and mortality in HIV-infected adults in a trial of early ART in West Africa. Methods: In the Temprano trial, HIV-infected adults were randomly assigned to start ART immediately or defer ART. After trial termination, HIV-1 DNA was measured in whole blood samples frozen at baseline. We analyzed the association between baseline PBMC HIV-1 DNA and long-term mortality. Findings: 2019 patients were followed for 9253 patient-years (median 4.9 years). At baseline, the median CD4 count was 462/mm3 [IQR 368–571], the median plasma HIV-1 RNA 4.7 log10 copies/ml [IQR 4.0–5.2], and the median HIV-1 DNA 2.9 log10 copies/million PBMC [IQR 2.5–3.3]. During follow-up, 86 participants died. In univariate analysis, the hazard ratio [HR] of death was 2.67 (95% CI, 1.68–4.22) for patients with HIV-1 DNA 3 log10 copies/million PBMC vs. others, and 2.10 (95% CI, 1.38–3.21) for patients with HIV-1 RNA 5 log10 copies/ml vs. others. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, HIV-1 DNA levels 3 log10 copies/million PBMC were strongly associated mortality (adjusted HR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.24–3.52, p= 0.005) while the association between baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA and mortality was not significant. Interpretation: In these African adults who started ART with high CD4 counts, HIV-1 DNA was a strong independent predictor of death. The HIV reservoir still plays a prognostic role in the early ART era.

Multiple early post-fusion steps of HIV-1 replication are restricted in resting peripheral blood CD4 T cells; however, molecular mechanisms that underlie metabolic control of these steps remain undefined. Here, we show that mTOR activity following T cell stimulatory signals overcomes metabolic restrictions in these cells by enabling the expansion of dNTPs to fuel HIV-1 reverse transcription (RT), as well as increasing acetyl-CoA to stabilize microtubules that transport RT products. We find that catalytic mTOR inhibition diminishes the expansion of pools of both of these metabolites by limiting glucose and glutamine utilization in several pathways, thereby suppressing HIV-1 infection. We demonstrate how mTOR-coordinated biosyntheses enable the early steps of HIV-1 replication, add metabolic mechanisms by which mTOR inhibitors block HIV-1, and identify some metabolic modules downstream of mTOR as druggable targets for HIV-1 inhibition.© 2020 The Author(s)Taylor et al. show that mTOR links cellular metabolism to the susceptibility of CD4 T cells to HIV-1 infection by expanding the pools of metabolites that facilitate the synthesis of reverse transcription products and their cytoplasmic transport toward the nucleus.

Increasing evidence links sex-based differences in HIV-1 immune responses and pathogenesis; however, little is known about differences in HIV-1 infection persistence. Here, we quantified persistent HIV-1 infection in 90 adults on suppressive antiretroviral therapy in Rakai, Uganda (57 female patients). Total HIV-1 DNA was quantified by PCR, and replication-competent provirus by quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA). Immune phenotyping of T cell subsets and plasma biomarkers was also performed. We found that whereas both sexes had similar total HIV DNA levels, female patients had significantly fewer resting CD4+ T cells harboring replication-competent virus, as measured by viral outgrowth in the QVOA. Factors associated with viral outgrowth differed by sex; notably, frequency of programmed cell death 1 (PD1+) CD4+ T cells correlated with reservoir size in male but not female patients. The sex-based differences in HIV-1 persistence observed in this cohort warrant additional research, especially given the widespread use of the QVOA to assess reservoir size and current explorations of PD1 agonists in cure protocols.

The efficiency and kinetics of the virus-receptor interactions required for a virus to productively infect a cell is determined by the biophysical properties of the receptors, which are in turn influenced by the receptors' plasma membrane (PM) environments. Currently, little is known about the biophysical properties of these receptor molecules or their engagement during virus binding and entry. Here we review virus-receptor interactions focusing on the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV), the etiological agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), as a model system. HIV is one of the best characterised enveloped viruses, with the identity, roles and structure of the key molecules required for infection well established. We review current knowledge of receptor-mediated HIV entry, addressing the properties of the HIV cell-surface receptors, the techniques used to measure these properties, and the macromolecular interactions and events required for virus entry. We discuss some of the key biophysical principles underlying receptor-mediated virus entry and attempt to interpret the available data in the context of biophysical mechanisms. We also highlight crucial outstanding questions and consider how new tools might be applied to advance understanding of the biophysical properties of viral receptors and the dynamic events leading to virus entry.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0005273619303062;7.5;7.2;7.8;00052736;S0005273619303062;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0005273619303062;;

In that same year, the CCR532 genetic variant was described as a strong protective factor against HIV-1 infection. These findings led to extensive research regarding the CCR5, culminating in critical scientific advances, such as the development of CCR5 inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection. Recently, the research landscape surrounding CCR5 has begun to change. Different research groups have realized that, since CCR5 has such important effects in the chemokine system, it could also affect other different physiological systems. Therefore, the effect of reduced CCR5 expression due to the presence of the CCR532 variant began to be further studied. Several studies have investigated the role of CCR5 and the impacts of CCR532 on autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, various types of cancer, and viral diseases. However, the role of CCR5 in diseases caused by bacteria and parasites is still poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this article is to review the role of CCR5 and the effects of CCR532 on bacterial (brucellosis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis and infection by Chlamydia trachomatis) and parasitic infections (toxoplasmosis, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease and schistosomiasis). Basic information about each of these infections was also addressed. The neglected role of CCR5 in fungal disease and emerging studies regarding the action of CCR5 on regulatory T cells are briefly covered in this review. Considering the “renaissance of CCR5 research,” this article is useful for updating researchers who develop studies involving CCR5 and CCR532 in different infectious diseases.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/iji.12485;2.5;2.3;2.2;17443121;;;;

Previous studies were conducted among people infected with subtypes B or C where CNS compartmentalization has been observed when comparing viral sequences in the blood to virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, little is known about CNS compartmentalization in other HIV-1 subtypes. Using a deep sequencing approach with Primer ID, we conducted a cross-sectional study among Nigerian and Malawian HIV-1 cohorts with or without fungal Cryptococcus infection diagnosed as cryptococcal meningitis (CM) to determine the extent of CSF/CNS compartmentalization with CM. Paired plasma and CSF samples from 45 participants were also analyzed for cytokine/chemokine levels. Viral populations comparing virus in the blood and the CSF ranged from compartmentalized to equilibrated, including minor or partial compartmentalization or clonal amplification of a single viral sequence. The frequency of compartmentalized viral populations in the blood and CSF was similar between the CM-and CM+ participants. We confirmed the potential to see compartmentalization with subtype C infection and have also documented CNS compartmentalization of an HIV-1 subtype G infection. Cytokine profiles indicated a proinflammatory environment, especially within the CSF/CNS. However, sCD163 was suppressed in the CSF in the presence of CM, perhaps due to elevated levels of IL-4, which were also a feature of the cytokine profile, showing a distinct cytokine profile with CM.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2019.0245;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;;

Analyses of prevalence and determinants of ART failure, the genetic diversity and drug resistance among people living with HIV (PLWH) helps improve HIV treatment efficiency and prevent HIV transmission. Methods: A total of 5157 PLWH were recruited from 2016 to 2017. The venous blood samples were subjected to RT-PCR, followed by sequencing of the HIV-1 pol gene, targeting the protease and reverse transcriptase fragments. HIV-1 diversity was analyzed using the DNAStar software and drug resistance mutations were analyzed using the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database. Results: A total of 2156 (41.81%) PLWH showed virological failure on ART. Males (ORm = 1.25), heterosexual behaviors and drug injection (ORm = 1.44) and mother to child transmission routes (ORm = 1.58), the clinical stage of AIDS (ORm = 1.35), having used illicit drugs and shared the needles (1-4 times: ORm = 1.34; more than 5 times: ORm = 1.52), having ever replaced ART regimen (ORm = 1.48) increased the risk of virological failure among PLWH, while higher education lever (ORm = 0.77) and  12 months on ART (12 ~ 36 months: ORm = 0.72; 36 months: ORm = 0.66) was associated with lower likelihood of virological failure. The data revealed that CRF07_BC (1508, 95.62%) were the most common strains, and the drug-resistant rate was 32.10% among PLWH with virological failure in this area. The high frequencies of drug resistance were found in EFV and NVP of NNRTIs, ABC, FTC and 3TC of NRTIs, and TPV/r in PIs. The most common mutations in NNRTIs, NRTIs and PIs were K103N/KN (64.69%), M184V/MV/I (36.29%) and Q58E/QE (4.93%), respectively. Conclusion: We concluded that surveillance of virological failure, HIV-1 subtypes, and drug resistance to understand HIV-1 epidemiology and guide modification of ART guidelines, and target prevention and control strategies should be formatted to reduce the virological failure and drug resistance to promote viral suppression and prevent HIV-1 transmission.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05124-1;4.5;4.3;4.1;;;;;

Regimens include two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus either an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), a non-NRTI (NNRTI) or a boosted protease inhibitor (PI). The objective was to examine the outcomes of recommended first-line ART in Germany. Methods: This nationwide observational study included treatment-naïve chronically HIV-1 infected patients receiving one of the recommended first-line regimens. Patients were allocated to three arms (INSTI, NNRTI, PI) and were prospectively followed for 24 months. Delayed treatment initiation was defined by a baseline CD4 T-cell count of < 350/µl or CDC clinical stage C. Results: Among a total of 434 patients enrolled, virologic failure was rare and occurred in 4.3% (6/141) in the PI arm, in 3.3% (4/122) in the NNRTI arm and in 0.6% (1/171) in the INSTI arm (p = 0.10). De novo drug resistance mutations developed in only two patients in the NNRTI arm. Nonetheless, treatment modifications were frequent (51%) and mostly performed for strategic reasons. Retention on all initial compounds at month 24 was 64%, 49%, and 22% in the INSTI, NNRTI and PI arms respectively. Delayed treatment initiation was common (47%) and more frequently observed in patients in the PI arm. It was not associated with virological failure. Conclusion: High efficacy and low virological failure rates were observed with recommended first-line regimens independent of delayed treatment initiation, chosen regimen and subsequent treatment modifications, demonstrating the validity of the current treatment guidelines.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s15010-020-01428-1;4.6;4.2;4.9;03008126;;;;

Live viral vaccines induce antibody responses that last a lifetime, but those induced with subunit vaccines wane rapidly. Studies in mice and humans have established that long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) in the bone marrow (BM) are critical mediators of durable antibody responses. Here, we present data that adjuvanting an HIV-1 clade C 1086.C-derived gp140 immunogen (Env) with a novel synthetic Toll-like receptor (TLR)-7/8 agonist named 3M-052 formulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic)acid or PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) or with alum, either alone or in combination with a TLR-4 agonist GLA, induces notably high and persistent (up to ~1 year) frequencies of Env-specific LLPCs in the BM and serum antibody responses in rhesus macaques. Up to 36 and 18% of Env-specific cells among total IgG-secreting BM-resident plasma cells were detected at peak and termination, respectively. In contrast, adjuvanting Env with alum or GLA in NP induced significantly lower (~<100-fold) LLPC and antibody responses. Immune responses induced by 3M-052 were also significantly higher than those induced by a combination of TLR-7/8 (R848) and TLR-4 (MPL) agonists. Adjuvanting Env with 3M-052 also induced robust activation of blood monocytes, strong plasmablast responses in blood, germinal center B cells, T follicular helper (TFH) cells, and persistent Env-specific plasma cells in draining lymph nodes. Overall, these results demonstrate efficacy of 3M-052 in promoting high magnitude and durability of antibody responses via robust stimulation of innate immunity and BM-resident LLPCs.";https://immunology.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.abb1025;0;7.9;12.8;;;;;

A dynamical model of HIV-1 infection in CD4+T cells with considering viral transmission from cell to cell and antibody response is constructed in this paper. Antibody response determines viral load in early HIV-1 infection. The existence and stability of the equilibrium is investigated by the basic reproduction ratio. The local stability of uninfected equilibrium is analyzed using Routh Hurwitz linearization. After investigating the local stability, we construct a Lyapunov function to investigate the global stability of endemic equilibrium.

CD8+ T cells are an important component of the host immune response to HIV-1 and may need to be harnessed if a vaccine is to be effective. CD8+ T cells recognize human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-associated viral epitopes and the HLA alleles vary significantly among different ethnic groups. It follows that definition of HIV-1-derived peptides recognized by CD8+ T cells in the geographically relevant regions will critically guide vaccine development. Here, we study fine details of CD8+ T-cell responses elicited in HIV-1/2-uninfected individuals in Nairobi, Kenya, who received a candidate vaccine delivering conserved regions of HIV-1 proteins called HIVconsv. Using 10-day cell lines established by in vitro peptide restimulation of cryopreserved PBMC and stably HLA-transfected 721.221/C1R cell lines, we confirm experimentally many already defined epitopes, for a number of epitopes we define the restricting HLA molecule(s) and describe four novel HLA-epitope pairs. We also identify specific dominance patterns, a promiscuous T-cell epitope and a rescue of suboptimal T-cell epitope induction in vivo by its functional variant, which all together inform vaccine design.;https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/8/2/260;6.5;7.5;4.5;;;;;

On the pathogen side, comparable methods are now applied to identify disease-modulating pathogen variants. As host and pathogen variants jointly determine disease outcomes, the most recent development has been to explore simultaneously host and pathogen genomes, through so-called genome-to-genome studies. In this review, we provide some background on the development of genome-to-genome analysis and we detail the first wave of studies in this emerging field, which focused on patients chronically infected with HIV and hepatitis C virus. We also discuss the need for novel statistical methods to better tackle the issues of population stratification and multiple testing. Finally, we speculate on future research areas where genome-to-genome analysis may prove to be particularly effective.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00439-019-02089-3;9.2;7.8;9.4;03406717;;;;

This paper aims at assessing changes over a five-year period (2009–2015) on the (risk) factors associated with HIV serodiscordance among couples in Mozambique, using cross-sectional data from the INSIDA and IMASIDA surveys. The pooled data of both surveys were analyzed using a joint model for three parameters characterizing in a particular way disagreement and sero(con/dis)corance between the HIV statuses of couples, as introduced by Aerts et al.: the probability that the female partner is HIV positive, given that both partners differ in their HIV status, the probability that only one partner is HIV positive, given that at least one of the two partners is positive (“positive” serodiscordance), and the probability that both partners are negative given that at most one of the two partners is positive (“negative” seroconcordance). The results reveal similar significant factors and estimates as in Aerts et al. (HIV prevalence, union number for woman, STI for man, condom use by woman and wealth index), but the additional significant factors “condom use by man” (no use had a negative effect on the positive serodiscordance) and “union number for man” (for couples where the man has been married or co-habiting with a woman before had a decreased negative seroconcordance) were identified. The only factor that had a different effect over time (IMASIDA as compared to INSIDA) was the effect of “HIV prevalence of province” on the negative seroconcordance. The negative effect of a higher HIV prevalence was less pronounced in 2015 for negative seroconcordance.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234723;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

The improved prognosis increases the desire of individuals with HIV to have biological offspring. With the establishment of washing protocol, no HIV transmission has been reported among more than 11,000 assisted reproduction technology (ART) cycles. Although the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Prevention Act in Korea prevents the use of HIV-infected blood, organs, tissues and semen, we recently obtained the authentic approval from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the practice of ART in HIV-serodiscordant couples. We report a 32-year-old HIV-seronegative female with her husband who was HIV-1 seropositive. After semen washing was performed by means of a density gradient and the swim-up technique, HIV-1 ribonucleic acid was not detected in the semen. An aliquot of processed semen was cryopreserved before ART. None of 3 cycles of intrauterine insemination was successful. After the third frozen-thawed embryo transfer following two cycles of intracytoplasmic sperm injection, an intrauterine singleton pregnancy was identified. She gave birth to a normal healthy male baby at full term by Cesarean section. She and her baby were tested for HIV during pregnancy and after delivery and the results were negative. Semen washing may be a safe ART method for HIV-serodiscordant couples who desire to have a baby in Korea.;https://jkms.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e197;2.8;2.8;3.1;10118934;;;;

In this study, we investigated the distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) among patients with HIV-1 infection in Henan Province, China. HIV-1 strains in blood samples taken from inpatients and outpatients visiting the Sixth People’s Hospital of Zhengzhou from August 2017 to July 2019 with a viral load (VL) greater than 1000 copies/ml were subjected to subtype and DRMs analysis. Out of a total of 769 samples, subtype and DRM data were obtained from 657 (85.43%) samples. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial pol gene sequences indicated that the most commonly found genotype was subtype B (45.51%, 299/657), followed by CRF01_AE (28.61%, 188/657), CRF07_BC (15.68%, 103/657), CRF08_BC (0.76%, 5/657), C (0.61%, 4/657), A (0.30%, 2/657), and others (8.52%, 56/657). Circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) were most commonly found in patients who were naïve to antiretroviral treatment (ART) (68.67%, 160/233). The percentage of patients with one or more major drug-resistance mutations was 50.99% (335/657), and it was 6.44% (15/233) in ART-naive patients that were primarily infected with subtype B (17.74%). Resistance mutations were most common at codons 65, 103, 106, 184, and 190 of the reverse transcriptase gene and codon 46 of the protease gene. Our study provides detailed information about the distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and the incidence of drug resistance mutations of different subtypes in ART-experienced and naïve patients. This can guide policymakers in making decisions about treatment strategies against HIV-1.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00705-020-04606-6;3.9;3.7;4.2;03048608;;;;

Maternal HIV infection and antiretroviral treatment (ART) increase the rate of preterm birth, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown, limiting progress in prediction, prevention and treatment. While overall  T cell levels remain constant, acute HIV infection is associated with a depletion of the V2 subset and an increase in the V1 subset, which do not return to baseline with ART.  T cells have also been implicated in adverse pregnancy outcomes and we therefore investigated the potential association between maternal HIV infection, peripheral  T cell frequencies and preterm birth. Methods Study participants were HIV positive (n = 47) and HIV negative (n = 45) women enrolled in a prospective pregnancy cohort study at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Soweto, South Africa. Women were enrolled in early pregnancy and gestational age was accurately determined by first trimester ultrasound scan. Peripheral blood samples were collected in each trimester and peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated. Frequencies of  T cells, V1+ and V2+  T cell subsets, and CCR6 chemokine receptor expression were determined by flow cytometry. Results Total  T cell levels were similar between HIV positive and HIV negative women throughout pregnancy. However, in each trimester maternal HIV infection was associated with reduced levels of the V2+ subset and increased levels of the V1+ subset, leading to a reversal of the V1/V2 ratio. Timing of ART initiation among HIV positive women did not affect levels of  T cells, the V1+ and V2+ subsets, or the V1/V2 ratio. Importantly, preterm birth was associated with lower total  T cell levels in early pregnancy and  T cell frequencies were lowest in HIV positive women who delivered preterm. Moreover, in the first trimester the proportion of V1+ T cells that were CCR6+ was significantly reduced in HIV+ women and women who delivered preterm, resulting in the lowest proportion of CCR6+ V1 T cells in HIV positive women who delivered preterm. Conclusions Our findings suggest that altered  T cell frequencies may link maternal HIV infection and preterm birth.  T cell frequencies in early pregnancy may serve as predictive biomarkers to identify women at risk of delivering preterm.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235162;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

The same Reveal tests are CE-marked for HIV-1 and HIV-2 detection in laboratory and point-of-care (POC) settings. Objective: We compared the performance of G4 LAB S/P with plasma and POC with whole blood (blood) for detecting early and established HIV-1/HIV-2 infections. Study design: Matched well-characterized plasma and simulated blood were used to evaluate: sensitivity in 104 HIV-1 and 55 HIV-2 established infections, specificity in 49 HIV-negative, and reactivity in early HIV-1 infection in a performance panel (n=38) and 18 plasma panels from seroconverters (SCs, n=183). Median number of days after first RNA-positive was calculated for 13 SCs. Impact of viral suppression (VS) was evaluated in 3 SCs receiving early antiretroviral therapy (ART). Results: Sensitivity was 100 % for HIV-1 and 98.18 % for HIV-2, while specificity was 100 %. All 38 plasma and blood become reactive by Fiebig stage V. Of 18 SCs, 10 had similar reactivity in plasma/blood, 7 showed delayed reactivity in blood, and 1 was nonreactive in plasma/blood. The median days for a G4-reactive after first RNApositive was 13 for plasma and 14 for blood. Long-term VS had no impact on G4 reactivity. Conclusions: Overall reactivity in early HIV-1 infections is delayed by one day in blood compared to plasma. If FDA-approved for POC settings, the G4 POC is a fast sensitive screening tool for HIV-1/HIV-2-specific IgG even during VS.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S138665322030086X;5.7;6.0;5.9;13866532;S138665322030086X;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S138665322030086X;;

There have been commendable efforts made towards the detection, treatment, and prevention of HIV in the country. Even though the genetic diversity of HIV has been shown to affect the parameters ranging from detection to vaccine development, there is no data available with respect to the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in Sri Lanka. Methods In this report we have performed the ancillary analysis of pol gene region sequences (n = 85) obtained primarily for the purpose of HIV-1 drug resistance genotyping. Briefly, dried blood spot specimens (DBS) collected from HIV-1 infected individuals between December 2015 and August 2018 were subjected to pol gene amplification and sequencing. These pol gene sequences were used to interpret the drug resistance mutation profiles. Further, sequences were subjected to HIV-1 subtyping using REGA 3.0, COMET, jPHMM and, RIP online subtyping tools. Moreover, Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was employed to estimate the evolutionary history of HIV-1 subtype C in Sri Lanka. Results Our analysis revealed that the majority (51.8%) of pol gene sequences were subtype C. Other than subtype C, there were sequences categorized as subtypes A1, B, D and G. In addition to pure subtypes there were sequences which were observed to be circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and a few of the recombinants were identified as potential unique recombinants (URFs). We also observed the presence of drug resistance mutations in 56 (65.9%) out of 85 sequences. Estimates of the Bayesian evolutionary analysis suggested that the HIV-1 subtype C was introduced to Sri Lanka during the early 1970s (1972.8). Conclusion The findings presented here indicate the presence of multiple HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of drug resistance mutations in Sri Lanka.

All Rights Reserved.Gene expression profiling of the host response to HIV infection has promised to fill the gaps in our knowledge and provide new insights toward vaccine and cure. However, despite 20 years of research, the biggest questions remained unanswered. A literature review identified 62 studies examining gene expression dysregulation in samples from individuals living with HIV. Changes in gene expression were dependent on cell/tissue type, stage of infection, viremia, and treatment status. Some cell types, notably CD4+ T cells, exhibit upregulation of cell cycle, interferon-related, and apoptosis genes consistent with depletion. Others, including CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells, exhibit perturbed function in the absence of direct infection with HIV. Dysregulation is greatest during acute infection. Differences in study design and data reporting limit comparability of existing research and do not as yet provide a coherent overview of gene expression in HIV. This review outlines the extraordinarily complex host response to HIV and offers recommendations to realize the full potential of HIV host transcriptomics.;http://mmbr.asm.org/lookup/doi/10.1128/MMBR.00080-19;24.0;27.5;29.1;10922172;;;;

However, how cytokines affect TFC remain unclear. Understanding which cytokines show the ability to affect TFC could be a key strategy toward curing HIV. Similar mechanisms could be used for the growth and transfer of TFCs and follicular helper T (TFH) cells; as a result, we hypothesized that cytokines IL-6, IL-21, and transforming growth factor- (TGF-), which are necessary for the differentiation of TFH cells, could also dictate the development of TFCs. In this work, lymph node mononuclear cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV-infected individuals were cocultured with IL-6, IL-21, and TGF-. We then carried out T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis to compare the differences between CXCR5– and CXCR5+CD8 T cells. Our results showed that the percentage and function of TFC can be enhanced by stimulation with TGF-. Besides, TGF- stimulation enhanced the diversity of TCR and complementarity-determining region 3 sequences. HIV DNA showed a negative correlation with TFC. The use of TGF- to promote the expression of CXCR5+CD8 T cells could become a new treatment approach for curing HIV.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1348-0421.12789;3.1;2.5;2.8;03855600;;;;

Recent Findings: Treated HIV-1 infection results in a state of immune exhaustion, which may involve reprogramming of infected and bystander cells toward a state of cellular senescence. Aging research has recently uncovered pathways that make senescent cells uniquely susceptible to pharmacologic intervention. Specific compounds, known as senotherapeutics, have been identified that interrupt pathways senescent cells depend on for survival. Several of these pathways are important in modulating the cellular microenvironment in chronically and latently infected cells. Strategies targeting these pathways may prove useful in combating both HIV-1 persistence and HIV-1-associated immune exhaustion. Summary: Senotherapeutics have recently been described as potential therapeutics for aging-associated diseases driven by senescent cells. Recently, correlations have emerged between HIV-1 infection, senescence, lifelong chronic infection, and viral persistence. New insights and therapies targeting cellular senescence may offer a novel strategy to address both HIV-1 persistence and immune exhaustion induced by chronic viral infection.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11904-020-00496-0;10.3;0;6.5;15483568;;;;

Class I human leukocyte antigens, especially the molecules encoded at the B locus (HLA[sbnd]B), are associated with increased susceptibility to acquire HIV infection and further progression to diseases (AIDS). Rationale: The aim of this study was to evaluate which variants of HLA-B are associated with the risk to acquire HIV infection in Indian population. We have recruited HIV-1 infected individuals (n = 240) with or without tuberculosis (TB) co-infection or other opportunistic infections attending the Out Patient Department (OPD) of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India for this study. We performed HLA-A, HLA[sbnd]B, and HLA-DR genotyping in HIV-infected and Healthy controls. Results: Our observation showed that the alleles HLA-A*24, B*35, B*51 and HLA DRB1*03 occurred more frequently among HIV-1 positive patients than control subjects suggests that they play a role in susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Further, higher preponderance of HLA-B*35 (30.2% vs 24%), were also found in HIV+ cohort. An increased frequency of HLA-B*35 in HIV+,TB+ cohort correlates its possible role in the acquisition of tuberculosis infection being 1.7 fold higher in HIV positive studied subjects. Conclusion: A comparative high-resolution analysis of B*35Px or B*35Py alleles among healthy controls and HIV+ individuals showed an overrepresentation of HLA-B*35Px alleles in the healthy Indian gene pool (58%) and in the HIV+ cohort (70%). The most common B*35 subtype found among the HIV infected subjects was B*3503/55 (20%; Px group), followed by B*3501 (10%; Py group).

New, previously unstudied viruses and some specific mutant or recombinant variants of known viruses constantly appear. An example is a variant of coronaviruses (CoV) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), named SARS-CoV-2. Some antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir as well as antiretroviral drugs including darunavir, lopinavir, and ritonavir are suggested to be effective in treating disorders caused by SARS-CoV-2. There are data on the utilization of antiretroviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Since there are many studies aimed at the identification of the molecular mechanisms of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and the development of novel therapeutic approaches against HIV-1, we used HIV-1 for our case study to identify possible molecular pathways shared by SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1. We applied a text and data mining workflow and identified a list of 46 targets, which can be essential for the development of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1.

This is mediated by their production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETS) to entrap pathogenic micro-organisms, preventing their amplification and dissemination. Pre-eclampsia (PE) is the leading cause of global maternal mortality, yet to date, there is no cure nor a gold-standard diagnostic strategy. The purpose of this review is to discover the role of neutrophils in PE as early identification markers. Additionally, this review aims to explore the role of neutrophils in HIV-infected pregnancies with PE as a source of synergy. Recent Findings: Recent findings demonstrate an elevation of neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in PE placentae. This is due to their activation by excessive release of syncytiotrophoblast microparticles (STBM). There is also an elevation of NETs in HIV-infected placentae—where histone H3 entraps HIV by binding to its glycoprotein envelope. Additionally, histones H1 and H2A inhibit HIV infection. It is interesting to note that women with both PE and HIV infection have supressed NETs. Summary: This review focuses on the role of neutrophils in the synergy of PE and HIV infection. It is plausible that the deregulation of NETs in the synergy of pre-eclamptic HIV-infected women is strategic for the entrapment of the HIV-1 virus. Finally, it is plausible that neutrophils and NETS may act as early biomarkers of PE development.

Thus, investigations into simpler regimens with comparable efficacy and improved safety have been undertaken and continue to be conducted. Various 2-drug combinations have been evaluated with variable results. The combinations of dolutegravir plus lamivudine and dolutegravir plus rilpivirine were found to be comparable in efficacy to conventional 3-drug regimens and have now been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have entered into clinical practice. Dolutegravir/rilpivirine was approved for the treatment of adults with HIV-1 infection whose virus has been suppressed on a stable regimen for at least 6 months, with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of the combination.

Data that could be used to guide the scale up of HIV prevention and control strategies has significant gaps. The study sought to estimate the prevalence of HIV and its associated determinants in Akwa Ibom state. Methods Akwa Ibom AIDS Indicator Survey (AKAIS) is a population based cross-sectional survey, with a two-stage probability sampling. The survey had both behavioural and biological components. Tablet-based questionnaire was used to collect data on participant’s household information, demographics, socio-economic, and behavioral risk factors associated with HIV; while the biological component involved collection of venous blood samples for participants who were over 19months. For children aged 18months on less, capillary blood from finger prick sample was used. Participants were tested for HIV. Other biomarker tests for HIV positive participants included CD4, HIV-1 RNA viral load and incidence assays. Results In all 15,609 people (8,963 adults aged 15 years and older (55% females), 6,646 individuals less than 15 years (51% males), from 4,313 households, participated in AKAIS. Overall, 2.8% (423 persons; 422 HIV-1 and 1 HIV-2) were found to be HIV positive. HIV prevalence was 4.8% in adults (15 years and above) and 0.4% in pediatric (< = 14 years) participants. HIV prevalence was significantly higher in females (5.6%) than males (3.7%) aged 15 years and older (p <0.001). Overall HIV incidence was 0.41% Conclusions HIV prevalence among adults was 4.8% with an overall incidence of 0.41%. These estimates are essential to inform strategic control and prevention of HIV epidemic in Akwa Ibom state targeting the affected populations.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234079;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

We recently evaluated the association between monocyte subsets and regulatory T cells in HIV-infected individuals with syphilis. Currently, the dynamic changes of CCR2 and CX3CR1 on monocyte subsets during HIV-1 and syphilis coinfection have not been fully investigated. In this study, cell surface staining was used to explore CCR2 and CX3CR1 expression on three monocyte subsets during HIV-1/T. pallidum coinfection. We found that CCR2 densities on the classical monocyte subsets decreased in acute HIV-1 infected (AHI) patients, chronic HIV-1-infected individuals without antiviral therapy (ART) (CHI+ ART–), chronic HIV-1-infected individuals receiving ART (CHI+ART+), rapid plasma reagin-positive (RPR+) individuals, CHI+ ART– plus RPR+ (CHI+RPR+ ART–) individuals, and CHI+ART+ plus RPR+ (CHI+RPR+ART+) individuals. CX3CR1 density increased on the three monocyte subsets during HIV-1 and/or T. pallidum infection. CX3CR1 density on the intermediate and non-classical monocyte subsets in CHI+ ART– individuals was lower than that in CHI+ART+ individuals, and CX3CR1 density on the three monocyte subsets in CHI+ART+ individuals was higher than that in CHI+RPR+ART+ individuals.

To date, a large amount of OMICs data as well as information from functional genomics screenings regarding the HIV–host interaction has been accumulated in the literature and in public databases. We processed databases containing HIV–host interactions and found 2910 HIV-1-human protein-protein interactions, mostly related to viral group M subtype B, 137 interactions between human and HIV-1 coding and non-coding RNAs, essential for viral lifecycle and cell defense mechanisms, 232 transcriptomics, 27 proteomics, and 34 epigenomics HIV-related experiments. Numerous studies regarding network-based analysis of corresponding OMICs data have been published in recent years. We overview various types of molecular networks, which can be created using OMICs data, including HIV–human protein–protein interaction networks, co-expression networks, gene regulatory and signaling networks, and approaches for the analysis of their topology and dynamics. The network-based analysis can be used to determine the critical pathways and key proteins involved in the HIV life cycle, cellular and immune responses to infection, viral escape from host defense mechanisms, and mechanisms mediating different susceptibility of humans to infection. The proteins and pathways identified in these studies represent a basis for developing new anti-HIV therapeutic strategies such as new drugs preventing infection of CD4+ cells and viral replication, effective vaccines, “shock and kill” and “block and lock” approaches to cure latent infection.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01314/full;5.0;5.6;6.4;;;;;

Although these novel drug formulations could contribute greatly to HIV treatment and prevention efforts, their lack of activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) could limit their global impact, particularly in populations with high burdens of both HIV and HBV. An urgent need for greater investment in research and development of long-acting drugs with dual activity against HIV and HBV exists. Access to long-acting HIV drug formulations with dual activity against HBV would be transformative and have a great impact on efforts to prevent, treat, and eradicate both of these important global epidemics.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S235230181930342X;14.3;17.7;19.0;;S235230181930342X;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S235230181930342X;;

Clade C envelopes were isolated from CAP257, an individual who developed a unique temporal pattern of neutralization breadth development, comprising three separate “Waves” targeting distinct Env epitopes and different HIV clades. We used phylogeny and neutralization criteria to down-select envelope vaccine candidates, and confirmed antigenicity of our antigens by interaction with well-characterized broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Using these envelopes, we performed rabbit studies that screened for immunogenicity of CAP257 Envs from timepoints preceding peak neutralization breadth in each Wave. Selected CAP257 envelopes from Waves 1 and 2, during the first 2 years of infection that were highly immunogenic in rabbits were then tested in macaques. We found that in rabbits and macaques, co-immunization of DNA, and protein envelope-based vaccines induced maximum binding and neutralizing antibody titers with three immunizations. No further benefit was obtained with additional immunizations. The vaccine strategies recapitulated the Wave-specific epitope targeting observed in the CAP257 participant, and elicited Tier 1A, 1B, and Tier 2 heterologous neutralization. CAP257 envelope immunogens also induced the development of ADCC and TFH responses in macaques, and these responses positively correlated with heterologous neutralization. Together, the results from two animal models in this study have implications for identifying effective vaccine immunogens. We used a multi-step strategy to (1) select an Env donor with well-characterized neutralization breadth development; (2) study Env phylogeny for potential immunogens circulating near peak breadth timepoints during the first 2 years of infection; (3) test down-selected Envs for antigenicity; (4) screen down-selected Envs in an effective vaccine regimen in rabbits; and (5) advance the most immunogenic Envs to NHP studies. The results were an induction of high titers of HIV-1 envelope-specific antibodies with increasing avidity and cross-clade neutralizing antibodies with effector functions that together may improve the potential for protection in a pre-clinical SHIV model.";https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00984/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;;;;

All rights reserved.Objective:Astrocytes are proposed to be a critical reservoir of HIV in the brain. However, HIV infection of astrocytes is inefficient in vitro except for cell-to-cell transmission from HIV-infected cells. Here, we explore mechanisms by which cell-free HIV bypasses entry and postentry barriers leading to a productive infection.Methods:HIV infection of astrocytes was investigated by a variety of techniques including transfection of CD4-expressing plasmid, treatment with lysosomotropic agents or using a transwell culture system loaded with HIV-infected lymphocytes. Infection was monitored by HIV-1 p24 in culture supernatants and integrated proviral DNA was quantified by Alu-PCR.Results:Persistent HIV infection could be established in astrocytes by transfection of proviral DNA, transduction with VSV-G-pseudotyped viruses, transient expression of CD4 followed by HIV infection, or simultaneous treatment with lysosomotropic chloroquine or Tat-HA2 peptide with HIV infection. In absence of these treatments, HIV entered via endocytosis as seen by electronmicroscopy and underwent lysosomal degradation without proviral integration, indicating endocytosis is a dead end for HIV in astrocytes. Nevertheless, productive infection was observed when astrocytes were in close proximity but physically separated from HIV-infected lymphocytes in the transwell cultures. This occurred with X4 or dual tropic R5X4 viruses and was blocked by an antibody or antagonist to CXCR4.Conclusion:A CD4-independent, CXCR4-dependent mechanism of viral entry is proposed, by which immature HIV particles from infected lymphocytes might directly bind to CXCR4 on astrocytes and trigger virus-cell fusion during or after the process of viral maturation. This mechanism may contribute to the formation of brain HIV reservoirs.;http://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAD.0000000000002512;8.8;7.1;7.5;02699370;;;;

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress viral load to undetectable levels in peripheral blood by standard measure, however immune activation/chronic inflammation and latent infection persist and affect quality of life. We have now shown that a novel therapeutic HIV vaccine consisting of replication-defective HIV (HIVAX), given in the context of viral suppression under ART, can reduce both immune activation/chronic inflammation and latent infection. Immune activation, as measured by percent of CD8 + HLA-DR + CD38 + T cells, approached levels of healthy controls at week 16 following vaccination. Reduced immune activation was accompanied by a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines and peripheral 47 + plasmacytoid DC (a marker of mucosal immune activation). Levels of both HIV-1 DNA and 2-LTR circles were reduced at week 16 following vaccination, suggesting HIVAX can impact HIV-1 latency and reduce viral replication. Surprisingly, reduced immune activation/chronic inflammation was accompanied by an increase in the percent of memory CD4 + T cells expressing markers PD-1 and TIM-3. In addition, evaluation of HIV-1 Gag-specific CD4 + T cells for expression of 96 T cell related genes pre- and post-therapy revealed increased expression of a number of genes involved in the regulation of immune activation, T cell activation, and antiviral responses. Overall this study provides evidence that vaccination with HIVAX in subjects under long term antiviral suppression can reduce immune activation/chronic inflammation and latent infection (Clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT01428596).;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264410X20304850;6.0;5.7;5.5;0264410X;S0264410X20304850;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0264410X20304850;;

INSTIs are generally well tolerated, and reported rates of discontinuation due to drug-related adverse events (AEs) have been very low to date. However, recent reports indicate that physicians should be aware of potential INSTI-related AEs to ensure good clinical practice. Areas covered: The authors performed a critical review of the safety issues affecting INSTIs based on published evidence from original studies and new data from researchers. Expert opinion: Almost all antiretroviral drugs, including INSTIs, are associated with undesirable AEs. Dolutegravir in particular has been associated with more frequent AEs such as neuropsychiatric disorders, neural tube defect in newborns, and weight gain. Data with bictegravir in routine practice are still scarce. While this association and its clinical relevance are not clear, physicians should be alert to the appearance of the aforementioned AEs and others in the future. In the meantime, INSTIs continue to be the preferred option in guidelines on antiretroviral therapy.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14740338.2020.1764531;6.3;6.3;6.2;14740338;;;;

Here, using a very sensitive multiplex RT-PCR assay, we screened 1,645 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens collected for pathology diagnostics in Central Africa between 1958 and 1966. We report the near-complete viral genome in one HIV-1 positive specimen from Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), from 1966 (""DRC66"")-a nonrecombinant sister lineage to subtype C that constitutes the oldest HIV-1 near full-length genome recovered to date. Root-to-tip plots showed the DRC66 sequence is not an outlier as would be expected if dating estimates from more recent genomes were systematically biased; and inclusion of the DRC66 sequence in tip-dated BEAST analyses did not significantly alter root and internal node age estimates based on post-1978 HIV-1 sequences. There was larger variation in divergence time estimates among datasets that were subsamples of the available HIV-1 genomes from 1978 to 2014, showing the inherent phylogenetic stochasticity across subsets of the real HIV-1 diversity. Our phylogenetic analyses date the origin of the pandemic lineage of HIV-1 to a time period around the turn of the 20th century (1881 to 1918). In conclusion, this unique archival HIV-1 sequence provides direct genomic insight into HIV-1 in 1960s DRC, and, as an ancient-DNA calibrator, it validates our understanding of HIV-1 evolutionary history.";http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1913682117;17.1;16.1;15.7;00278424;;;;

Methods: A total of 290 newly diagnosed HIV infected student MSM were selected as the research objects for molecular studies on HIV, in Zhejiang province during 2013 to 2015. Data on epidemiology and plasma samples of these people were collected. HIV-1 nucleotide sequences of pol gene regions were amplified using the RT-PCR/nested PCR method and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to determine the HIV-1 genotypes. Characteristics of transmission mode among these cases were also analyzed. Results: A total of 290 cases, 50.3% were diagnosed in Hangzhou and 81.0% had college or above degrees. 178 sequences including 10 subtypes, were obtained, with the main subtypes as CRF01_AE (49.4%, 88/178) and CRF07_BC (39.3%, 70/178). A total of 18 molecular transmission clusters were formed (42 cases, cluster size from 2 to 4), with the proportions of clusters as 23.6% (42/178). 61.9% (26/42) of student MSM with their schools located in the same district within the transmission clusters. Their sexual partners would include both student MSM and non-student MSM. The proportion of clusters among middle school students was 38.2% (13/34), higher than that of college students (20.1%, 29/144) ( (2)=4.996, P<0.05). Conclusions: The HIV-1 subtypes of student MSM in Zhejiang province appeared diversity, which indicated with the diversity of sources of infection. The geographical distribution of cluster cases is relatively centralized.

Developing antivirals against previously undefined targets is essential to treat existing drug-resistant HIV strains. Some peptides derived from HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env, gp120-gp41) have been shown to be effective in inhibiting HIV-1 infection. Therefore, we screened a peptide library from HIV-1 Env and identified a peptide from the cytoplasmic region, designated F9170, able to effectively inactivate HIV-1 virions and induce necrosis of HIV-1–infected cells, and reactivated latently infected cells. F9170 specifically targeted the conserved cytoplasmic tail of HIV-1 Env and effectively disrupted the integrity of the viral membrane. Short-term monoadministration of F9170 controlled viral loads to below the limit of detection in chronically SHIV-infected macaques. F9170 can enter the brain and lymph nodes, anatomic reservoirs for HIV latency. Therefore, F9170 shows promise as a drug candidate for HIV treatment.;https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaz2254;24.2;20.9;18.8;19466234;;;;

In this report, we used single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) technology to study HIV-induced transcriptomic change in innate immune cells in lymphoid organs. We performed scRNA-Seq on hCD45+hCD3–hCD19–human leukocytes isolated from spleens of humanized NOD/Rag2–/–c–/– (NRG) mice transplanted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (NRG-hu HSC mice). We identified major populations of innate immune cells, including plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), macrophages, NK cells, and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). HIV-1 infection significantly upregulated genes involved in type I IFN inflammatory pathways in each of the innate immune subsets. Interestingly, we found that TRAIL was upregulated in the innate immune populations, including pDCs, mDCs, macrophages, NK cells, and ILCs. We further demonstrated that blockade of the TRAIL signaling pathway in NRG-hu HSC mice prevented HIV-1–induced CD4+ T cell depletion in vivo. In summary, we characterized HIV-induced transcriptomic changes of innate immune cells in the spleen at single-cell levels, identified the TRAIL+ innate immune cells, and defined an important role of the TRAIL signaling pathway in HIV-1–induced CD4+ T cell depletion in vivo.;http://insight.jci.org/articles/view/135344;0;2.6;5.8;;;;;

Several conserved targets recognized by these antibodies have been identified on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. One such target that shows particular promise for vaccination is the N332-supersite. Areas covered: This review describes the potential of the N332-supersite epitope as an immunogen design platform. We discuss the structure of the epitope and the bNAbs that target it, emphasizing their diverse modes of binding. Furthermore, the successes and limitations of recent N332-supersite immunization studies are discussed. Expert opinion: During HIV-1 infection, some of the broadest and most potent bNAbs target the N332-supersite. Furthermore, some of these antibodies require less affinity maturation than the high levels typical of many bNAbs, making these potentially more achievable vaccine targets. In addition, bNAbs bind this epitope with multiple angles of approach and glycan dependencies, perhaps increasing the probability of eliciting such responses by vaccination. Animal studies have shown that N332-supersite bNAb precursors can be activated by novel immunogens. While follow-up studies must establish whether boosting strategies can drive the maturation of bNAbs from these precursors, the development of targeted N332-supersite immunogens expands our arsenal of potential HIV-1 vaccine candidates.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14728222.2020.1752183;7.9;8.4;8.5;14728222;;;;

In humans, we know of 10 different TLRs, which are expressed to varying degrees in immune cell subsets. Engaging TLRs through their specific ligands leads to activation of the innate immune system and secondarily priming of the adaptive immune system. Because of these unique properties, TLR agonists have been investigated as immunotherapy in cancer treatment for many years, but in recent years there has also been growing interest in the use of TLR agonists in the context of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) cure research. The primary obstacle to curing HIV-1 is the presence of a latent viral reservoir in transcriptionally silent immune cells. Due to the very limited transcription of the integrated HIV-1 proviruses, latently infected cells cannot be targeted and cleared by immune effector mechanisms. TLR agonists are very interesting in this context because of their potential dual effects as latency reverting agents (LRAs) and immune modulatory compounds. Here, we review preclinical and clinical data on the impact of TLR stimulation on HIV-1 latency as well as antiviral and HIV-1-specific immunity. We also focus on the promising role of TLR agonists in combination strategies in HIV-1 cure research. Different combinations of TLR agonists and broadly neutralizing antibodies or TLRs agonists as adjuvants in HIV-1 vaccines have shown very encouraging results in non-human primate experiments and these concepts are now moving into clinical testing.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01112/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;;;;

Methods: We analyzed published HIV-2 pol sequences to identify HIV-2 treatment-selected mutations (TSMs). Mutation prevalences were determined by HIV-2 group and ARV status. Nonpolymorphic mutations were those in <1% of ARV-naive persons. TSMs were those associated with ARV therapy after multiple comparisons adjustment. Results: We analyzed protease (PR) sequences from 483 PR inhibitor (PI)-naive and 232 PI-treated persons; RT sequences from 333 nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTI)-naive and 252 NRTI-treated persons; and integrase (IN) sequences from 236 IN inhibitor (INSTI)-naive and 60 INSTI-treated persons. In PR, 12 nonpolymorphic TSMs occurred in 11 persons: V33I, K45R, V47A, I50V, I54M, T56V, V62A, A73G, I82F, I84V, F85L, L90M. In RT, 9 nonpolymorphic TSMs occurred in 10 persons: K40R, A62V, K70R, Y115F, Q151M, M184VI, S215Y. In IN, 11 nonpolymorphic TSMs occurred in 4 persons: Q91R, E92AQ, T97A, G140S, Y143G, Q148R, A153G, N155H, H156R, R231 5-amino acid insertions. Nine of 32 nonpolymorphic TSMs were previously unreported. Conclusions: This meta-analysis confirmed the ARV association of previously reported HIV-2 DRMs and identified novel TSMs. Genotypic and phenotypic studies of HIV-2 TSMs will improve approaches to predicting HIV-2 ARV susceptibility and treating HIV-2-infected persons.";https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/221/12/1962/5713448;10.4;9.2;9.0;00221899;;;;

It also acts as a host restriction factor has BST2-dependent and BST2-independent antiviral activity to inhibit the release of HIV-1. In a previous study, we demonstrated that feline BCA2 (fBCA2) also has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, although its antiviral mechanism remained unclear. In this study, we showed that fBCA2 can interact with feline BST2 (fBST2) and exhibits an fBST2-independent antiviral function, and the RING domain is necessary for the antiviral activity of fBCA2. fBCA2 could degrade HIV-1 Gag and restrict HIV-1 transcription to counteract HIV-1 but not promote the degradation of HIV-1 through lysosomal. Furthermore, for both fBCA2 and hBCA2, restricting viral transcription is the main anti-FIV mechanism compared to degradation of FIV Gag or promoting viral degradation. Consequently, transcriptional regulation of HIV or FIV by BCA2 should be the primary restriction mechanism, even though the degradation mechanism is different when BCA2 counteracts HIV or FIV. This may be due to BCA2 has a special preference in antiviral mechanism in the transmission of primate or non-primate retroviruses.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01230/full;5.0;5.6;6.4;;;;;

As a result, it has become recognized as a privileged structural feature for targeting a wide range of therapeutic target proteins, including MAO, tyrosine kinases, BACE1, steroid receptors, mGlu5 receptors, FFA1/GPR40, and HIV-1 RT. Furthermore, a terminal alkyne functionality is frequently introduced in chemical biology probes as a click handle to identify molecular targets and to assess target engagement.

They are naturally released from cells into the extracellular environment. Based on their biogenesis, release pathways, size, content, and function, EVs are classified into exosomes, microvesicles (MVs), and apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs). Previous research has documented that EVs, specifically exosomes and MVs, play an important role in HIV infection, either by promoting HIV infection and pathogenesis or by inhibiting HIV-1 to a certain extent. We have also previously reported that EVs (particularly exosomes) from vaginal fluids inhibit HIV at the post-entry step (i.e., reverse transcription, integration). Besides the role that EVs play in HIV, they are also known to regulate the process of wound healing by regulating both the immune and inflammatory responses. It is noted that during the advanced stages of HIV infection, patients are at greater risk of wound-healing and wound-related complications. Despite ongoing research, the data on the actual effects of EVs in HIV infection and wound healing are still premature. This review aimed to update the current knowledge about the roles of EVs in regulating HIV pathogenesis and wound healing. Additionally, we highlighted several avenues of EV involvement in the process of wound healing, including coagulation, inflammation, proliferation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Understanding the role of EVs in HIV infection and wound healing could significantly contribute to the development of new and potent antiviral therapeutic strategies and approaches to resolve impaired wounds in HIV patients.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/6/584;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

Two well-characterized integrative systems have been described that rely on viral and nonviral vectors. However, use of viral vectors for gene therapy has been associated with several safety concerns. Here, we report a virus-free method for stable transgenesis based on the reaction of retroviral integrase. We constructed a gateway cloning compatible vector containing two truncated long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences (dLTR) that flank the transgene cassette. Notably, 5-ACTG-3 and blunt-end restriction cutting sites were also embedded at the end of dLTR to be recognized by HIV-1 integrase. When performing coinjection of transgene cassette and integrase mRNA into zebrafish embryos at one cell stage, there were 50% to 55% of injected embryos expressing a marker gene in a desired pattern. When applying our method in mammalian cells, there were 42% of cultured human epithelial cell lines showing stable integration. These results demonstrated that our method can successfully insert an exogenous gene into the host genome with highly efficient integration. Importantly, this system operates without most of the viral components while retaining effective stable transgenesis. We anticipate this method will provide a convenient, safe, and highly efficient way for applications in transgenesis and gene therapy.© 2020 The Author(s)Efficient transgene delivery is critical for genetic manipulation and therapeutic intervention of target cells.

Studies on other viral oncogenes suggest that TAg may also inhibit the intracellular autonomous innate immune system that triggers defensive antiviral responses upon detection of viral components by cytosolic sensors. Here we show that an innate response can be generated after HIV-1-derived LV transfection in HEK293T cells, particularly by the transgene, yet, remarkably, this had no effect on LV titer. Further, overexpression of DNA sensing pathway components led to expression of inflammatory cytokine and interferon (IFN) stimulated genes but did not result in detectable IFN or CXCL10 and had no impact on LV titer. Exogenous IFN- also did not affect LV production or transduction efficiency in primary T cells. Additionally, manipulation of TAg did not affect innate antiviral responses, but stable expression of TAg boosted vector production in HEK293 cells. Our findings demonstrate a measure of innate immune competence in HEK293T cells but, crucially, show that activation of inflammatory signaling is uncoupled from cytokine secretion in these cells. This provides new mechanistic insight into the unique suitability of HEK293T cells for LV manufacture.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2329050119301512;4.5;5.0;6.2;;S2329050119301512;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2329050119301512;;

Integrase defective lentiviral vector (IDLV) represents a promising vaccine candidate, inducing functional and durable immune responses in mice and non-human primates. Here, we designed HIV- and SIV-based IDLVs to express the HIVACAT T cell immunogen (HTI), a mosaic antigen designed to cover vulnerable sites in HIV-1 Gag, Pol, Vif, and Nef. We observed that HTI expression during lentiviral vector production interfered profoundly with IDLV particles release because of sequestration of both HIV- and SIV-Gag proteins in the cytoplasm of the vector-producing cells. However, modifications in IDLV design and vector production procedures greatly improved recovery of both HIV- and SIV-based IDLV-HTI. Immunization experiments in BALB/c mice showed that both IDLVs elicited HTI-specific T cell responses. However, immunization with HIV-based IDLV elicited also a T cell response toward exogenous HIV proteins in IDLV particles, suggesting that SIV-based IDLV may be a preferable platform to assess the induction of transgene-specific immune responses against rationally designed HIV structural antigens. These data support the further evaluation of IDLV as an effective platform of T cell immunogens for the development of an effective HIV vaccine.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2329050120300243;4.5;5.0;6.2;;S2329050120300243;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2329050120300243;;

The virus replicates inside the host and infects the T-cells instigating acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The glycoprotein 41 (gp41) of HIV helps to mediate the fusion of virus and host membranes. The detailed mechanism of host cell invasion by virus remains obscure due to the unavailability of experimental structure of complete gp41. In the current study, the post-fusion (PoF) trimeric structure of ecto-domain including transmembrane domain of gp41 was modeled using multiple homologous templates of Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and HIV-1. In order to validate the gp41 model, interactions of three peptide inhibitors: T20, C37 and C34; were studied using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding free-energy calculation and per-residue energy decomposition analysis. The binding free energy calculated using MM-PBSA (Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area) method predicts maximum affinity for C34 and minimum by T20 for gp41, which is in good agreement with the available computational and experimental studies. The van der Waals interaction is a dominant contributor for the peptide-gp41 complexes. The per-residue decomposition of energy confirmed the role of Trp117, Trp120 and Ile124, present in C34 and C37, for the strong hydrophobic interactions with the deep pocket localized around the N-terminal of gp41, which is lacking in T20. The HIV-1 gp41 structure developed in this work can be used in future study to gain insight into the mechanism of virus invasion and probing potent inhibitor to eliminate AIDS.

Yet the preclinical animal model with transplantation of autologous CCR5-ablated HSCs remains to be optimized. In this study, four Chinese rhesus macaques of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) chronic infection were given long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART), during which peripheral CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were purified and infected with CCR5-specific CRISPR/Cas9 lentivirus (three monkeys) or GFP lentivirus (one monkey). After non-myeloablative conditioning, the CCR5-modified or GFP-labeled HSPCs were autotransplanted to four recipients, and ART was withdrawn following engraftment. All of the recipients survived the process of transplantation. The purified CD34+ HSPCs harbored an undetectable level of integrated SIV DNA. The efficiency of CCR5 disruption in HSPCs ranges from 6.5% to 15.6%. Animals experienced a comparable level of hematopoietic reconstuction and displayed a similar physiological homeostasis Despite the low-level editing of CCR5 in vivo (0.3%–1%), the CCR5-disrupted cells in peripheral CD4+ Effector Memory T cell (TEM) subsets were enriched 2- to 3-fold after cessation of ART. Moreover, two of the three treated monkeys displayed a delayed viral rebound and a moderately recovered immune function 6 months after ART withdrawal. This study highlights the importance of improving the CCR5-editing efficacy and augmenting the virus-specific immunity for effective treatment of HIV-1 infection.© 2020 The AuthorsCRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing holds great promise in HIV-1 treatment. Chen and colleagues autotransplanted the CRISPR-mediated CCR5-disrupted HSPCs to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected monkeys. A low-level editing of CCR5 was compensated with a remarkable enrichment of CCR5-disrupted CD4+ TEMs after ART withdrawal and a delayed viral rebound in two out of three treated monkeys.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2329050120300346;4.5;5.0;6.2;;S2329050120300346;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2329050120300346;;

Management of sCVE includes performing genotypic HIV-1 resistance testing (GRT) on CSF and plasma HIV and changing ART accordingly. Neither GRT nor newer drugs (Dolutegravir and Darunavir/ritonavir) are routinely available in India. As a result, management of sCVE includes 2 modalities: a) ART intensification by adding drugs that reach therapeutic concentrations in CSF, like Zidovudine, to existing ART or b) Changing to a regimen containing newer boosted PI/r and integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) as per GRT or expert opinion. In this retrospective study, we report the outcomes of above 2 modalities in treatment of sCVE in Pune, India.Fifty-seven episodes of sCVE in 54 people with HIV taking PI/r-containing ART were identified. Clinical, demographic, laboratory and ART data were recorded. Forty-seven cases had follow-up data available after ART change including measurement of plasma and CSF viral load (VL).Of the 47 cases, 23 received zidovudine intensification (Group A, median VL: plasma- 290, CSF- 5200 copies/mL) and 24 received PI/INSTI intensification (Group B, median VL: plasma- 265, CSF-4750 copies/mL). CSF GRT was performed in 16 participants: 8 had triple class resistance. After ART change, complete resolution of neurologic symptoms occurred in most participants (Group A: 18, Group B: 17). In Group A, follow-up plasma and CSF VL were available for 21 participants, most of whom achieved virologic suppression (VL < 20 copies/mL) in plasma (17) and CSF (15). Four participants were shifted to the PI/INSTI intensification group due to virologic failure (plasma or CSF VL > 200 copies/mL). In Group B, follow-up plasma and CSF VL were available for 23 participants, most of whom also achieved virologic suppression in plasma (21) and CSF (18). Four deaths were noted, 2 of which were in individuals who interrupted ART.This is a unique sCVE cohort that was managed with 1 of 2 approaches based on treatment history and the availability of GRT. At least 75% of participants responded to either approach with virologic suppression and improvement in symptoms.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/MD.0000000000020516;2.1;2.7;2.7;;;;;

This allows the bypass of all steps normally needed in the intracellular phosphorylation. These TriPPPro-nucleotides comprising an acyloxybenzyl (AB; ester) or an alkoxycarbonyloxybenzyl (ACB; carbonate) in combination with an ACB moiety are described as NTP delivery systems. The introduction of these two different groups led to the selective formation of -(ACB)-d4TTPs by chemical hydrolysis and in particular by cell extract enzymes. -(AB)-d4TTPs are faster cleaved than -(ACB)-d4TTPs.

A variety of host, viral and environmental factors can either increase HIV-1 shedding in the infected partner and/or increase mucosal susceptibility of the HIV-1 uninfected partner. Clinical and epidemiological studies have clearly established that Neisseria gonorrhoeae substantially enhances HIV-1 transmission, despite it not being an ulcerative infection. This review will consider findings from molecular, immunologic and clinical studies that have focused on each of these two human-restricted pathogens, in order to develop an integrative model that describes how gonococci can both increase mucosal shedding of HIV-1 from a co-infected person and facilitate virus establishment in a susceptible host.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01299/full;5.0;5.6;6.4;;;;;

Methods: HIV/AIDS patients met the criteria were all enrolled in a 1-year cohort study, in which patients receiving HAART alone were designated as Group A, those receiving HAART in combination with SLFZC were designated as Group B, and those receiving HAART in combination with QDC were designated as Group C, 100 cases in each group. The dose of SLFZC was 1.48 g (4 capsules), 3 times daily, and QDC 1.56 g (4 capsules), 3 times daily. T cell subsets, HIV RNA and HIV-1 drug resistance were detected at enrollment and 1 year after treatment. Patients were followed up every 3 months, during which side-effects and other clinical data were recorded. Results: After 1-year treatment, the median increment in CD4 counts was 165.0, 178.0 and 145.0 cells/L for Group A, B and C, respectively. HIV RNA was undetectable in 94% of patients in Group A, 96% in Group B and 92% in Group C. There were no differences regarding the increment in CD4 counts, HIV RNA and frequency of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations. Two of the 14 suspected side-effect symptoms, i.e. fatigue and dizziness, were lower in Groups B and C than in Group A (P<0.05, respectively) Conclusions: SLFZC and QDC do not have a negative impact on immunological and virological response to HAART; however, these preparations are not as potent in reducing HAART-associated side-effects as anticipated.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11655-019-3156-x;1.9;1.9;2.2;16720415;;;;

To characterize the development of bNAbs in HIV-1 subtype C infected individuals, a panel of 18 Env-pseudotyped viruses was used to screen 18 study participants. The specificity of plasma neutralization was mapped against Env mutants and MPER chimeras. Envelope (env) gene sequence evolution was characterized by single genome amplification and sequencing. Three out of eighteen individuals developed broad plasma neutralizing activity (>60% breadth). Two of the three participants may target epitopes comprising glycans at position 276 of the D loop in the CD4 binding site and 332 glycan supersite, respectively. Deletion of these glycans was associated with neutralization resistance. Our study describes the kinetics of the development of plasma neutralizing activity and identified amino acid residue changes suggestive of immune pressure on putative epitopes. The study enhances our understanding of how neutralization breadth develops in the course of HIV-1 subtype C infection.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0042682220300568;6.3;6.6;5.2;00426822;S0042682220300568;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0042682220300568;;

Setting Mathematical model. Methods We used discrete event simulation modeling to estimate the probability of HIV-TE in the first 8 weeks after ART initiation; we varied ART initiation from D0 to D28 after simulated “diagnosis”. The model inputs used sexual behavior parameters from the MSM population of the START trial, and transmission rates per-sex act and HIV-1 RNA from recent meta-analyses. HIV-1 RNA decay curves were modeled from the databases of Single (efavirenz [EFV] v dolutegravir [DTG]), Spring-2 (raltegravir [RAL] v DTG), and Flamingo (darunavir/ritonavir [DRVr] v DTG) trials. Results We found that the number of HIV-TE per index patient in the first 8 weeks after ART initiation increased linearly for same-day ART to initiation on day 28. Small but statistically significant advantages of integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) over EFV and DRVr were found. Conclusions Rapid, if not same-day initiation of INSTI-based ART to newly diagnosed HIV-infected MSM has the potential for substantial public health benefits related to decreases in HIV-TE.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236032;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

Expanding syphilis testing to improve timely diagnosis and treatment is critical to improve syphilis control. However, syphilis testing rates remain low among MSM, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We describe the protocol for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess whether provision of syphilis self-testing services can increase the uptake of syphilis testing among MSM in China. Methods: Four hundred forty-four high-risk MSM will be recruited online and randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to (1) standard syphilis self-testing arm; (2) a self-testing arm program enhanced with crowdsourcing and a lottery-based incentive, and (3) a standard of care (control). Self-testing services include a free syphilis self-test kit through the mail at monthly intervals. Participants in the lottery incentive arm will additionally receive health promotion materials generated from an open crowdsourcing contest and be given a lottery draw with a 10% chance to win 100 RMB (approximately 15 US Dollars) upon confirmed completion of syphilis testing. Syphilis self-test kits have step-by-step instructions and an instructional video. This is a non-blinded, open-label, parallel RCT. Participants in each arm will be followed-up at three and 6 months through WeChat (a social media app like Facebook messenger). Confirmation of syphilis self-test use will be determined by requiring participants to submit a photo of the used test kit to study staff via secure data messaging. Both self-testing and facility-based testing will be ascertained by sending a secure photographic image of the completed kit through an existing digital platform. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants who tested for syphilis in the past 3 months. Discussion: Findings from this study will provide much needed insight on the impact of syphilis self-testing on promoting routine syphilis screening among MSM. The findings will also contribute to our understanding of the safety, effectiveness and acceptability of syphilis self-testing. These findings will have important implications for self-testing policy, both in China and internationally.

However, little is known about the genetic characteristics of HIV-1 among this population. A molecular epidemiological investigation was conducted among the newly diagnosed antiretroviral therapy-naïve HIV-1-infected individuals during 2015-2019 in Nanjing city, China. The pol fragment (HXB2: 2,253-3,311) was obtained by HIV-1 RNA extraction and gene amplification, and subjected to genotyping, recombination analysis, and phylogenetic inference. A total of 945 pol sequences from 226 students and 719 nonstudents were successfully amplified. Multiple genotypes were identified in students, including CRF01_AE (37.66%), CRF07_BC (32.90%), CRF55_01B (5.63%), CRF68_01B (3.46%), CRF67_01B (3.03%), subtype B (1.73%), and CRF58_01B (1.30%) and unique recombinant forms (URFs) of 01C_like (7.08%), 0107_like (3.98%), 01BC_like (2.21%), and 01B_like (1.33%). The distribution of genotypes among students was similar to that among nonstudents. The estimated mean evolutionary rate of URFs was 2.89 × 10-3 [95% Bayesian credible interval: 1.89-3.90] nucleotide substitutions/site/year. Approximately 64% (21/33) of URFs among students were located in three major clusters (0107_like, 01C_like 1, and 01C_like 2 clusters), which had recent time to the most recent common ancestors and low mean genetic distance, and presumably originated from Nanjing (posterior probability =0.99, state probability =0.9). Among 226 students with pol segments, the prevalence of primary and transmitted drug resistance mutations was 15.93% and 3.98%, respectively. The rapid evolution of multiple HIV-1 genotypes and high prevalence of URFs circulating among students in Nanjing emphasized the necessity of comprehensive surveillance for HIV-1 transmission among this population.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2019.0288;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;;

Using the protease inhibitor lopinavir (LPV) as model drug, LPV loaded CD polymers (pHPCD and pMCD) were prepared and fully characterized. The physicochemical characterization and in vitro drug release confirmed the successful synthesis of pHPCD and pMCD, the formation of sub-micron sized particles and a 12-14 fold increase in LPV solubility. Cytotoxicity assays indicated that both pHPCD and pMCD were able to improve the safety profile of LPV while the viral infectivity assay revealed a concentration independent anti-HIV-1 effect for both pHPCD and pMCD with a maximum percentage inhibition (MPI) of 79 and 91% respectively. After LPV loading, the antiviral profile of pHPCD was reversed to the sigmoidal dose-response profile of LPV, while pMCD maintained its dose-independent profile followed by a LPV mediated increase in viral inhibition.

HIV-1 arose as a regional zoonotic disease during the last century and evolved into a global crisis of enormous proportions; it was nearly universally fatal, but its global spread and disease progression were relatively slow, and it was perceived as being more escapable. More recent outbreaks, such as Ebola in West Africa and Eastern Congo and MERS-CoV in the Middle East were characterized by high mortality rates and rapid spread, but remained relatively contained regionally, with only episodic global spread. The arboviruses, Zika and chikungunya, caused devastating disease with long-lasting effects, but did not cause high mortality and were geographically limited by the range of their vectors. During the last century, the world has endured threats from avian influenza and pandemic influenza, but neither led to shutting down of society to the extent experienced with COVID-19. Uniquely, COVID-19 is caused by a newly discovered CoV strain and part of a virus family that many people had not heard of before, has substantial human-to-human transmission through respiratory secretions, has spread globally within a matter of weeks, affects individuals from all levels of society and status, and has a high enough morbidity and mortality to overwhelm our health care systems.

In the given study, a series of eighteen new (3a-r) 3-ethoxy salicylaldehyde-based thiosemicarbazones (TSC), bearing aryl and cycloalkyl substituents, were synthesized and assayed for their pharmacological potential against carbonic anhydrases (hCA I and hCA II), cholinesterases (AChE and BChE) and -glycosidase. The hCA I isoform was inhibited by these novel 3-ethoxysalicylaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derivatives (3a-r) in low nanomolar levels, the Ki of which differed between 144.18 ± 26.74 and 454.92 ± 48.32 nM. Against the physiologically dominant isoform hCA II, the novel compounds demonstrated Kis varying from 110.54 ± 14.05 to 444.12 ± 36.08 nM. Also, these novel derivatives (3a-r) effectively inhibited AChE, with Ki values in the range of 385.38 ± 45.03 to 983.04 ± 104.64 nM. For BChE was obtained with Ki values in the range of 400.21 ± 35.68 to 1003.02 ± 154.27 nM. For -glycosidase the most effective Ki values of 3l, 3n, and 3q were with Ki values of 12.85 ± 1.05, 16.03 ± 2.84, and 19.16 ± 2.66 nM, respectively. Moreover, the synthesized TCSs were simulated using force field methods whereas the binding energies of the selected compounds were estimated using MM-GBSA method. The findings indicate the present novel 3-ethoxy salicylaldehyde-based thiosemicarbazones to be excellent hits for pharmaceutical applications.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0045206820309834;4.8;4.3;4.5;00452068;S0045206820309834;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0045206820309834;;

The AspectTM HIVST mobile application (app) was developed for use in South Africa. Objectives: This study evaluated the acceptability and feasibility of the AspectTM HIVST app for individuals from the inner city of Johannesburg. Method: This cross-sectional pilot, with a convenience sample of 300 adults, was conducted in July 2018. Participants were provided an OraQuick HIVST kit and a smartphone preloaded with the app, then asked to follow the in-app instructions for use (IFU) to complete the HIVST and upload results. Trained healthcare workers (HCWs) observed and recorded any deviations from the IFU, and conducted a post-test survey to assess acceptability. Feasibility was evaluated by the number of participants who agreed to participate, completed the self-test, and uploaded all information onto the app correctly. Results: Most participants (98.7%) found the app easy to use. To reduce difficulties related to the IFU (26; 8.7%), participants suggested multimedia supplements (4; 1.3%), additional languages (4; 1.3%) and simplified instructions (5; 1.7%). All individuals approached, agreed to participate, 267 (89.0%) correctly completed all steps and 210 (78.7%) successfully captured all information on the app. Most errors (26; 8.7%) were testing errors and 1 (0.3%) was from the app sequence. Twelve (4.5%) errors were with test strip imaging and 72 (27.0%) discordances were with demographic information. Conclusion: Despite some challenges with IFU interpretation and data capture via the app, this pilot showed that the AspectTM HIVST app is an acceptable way to upload mobile HIVST results and demographic information to a central database.";http://www.sajhivmed.org.za/index.php/HIVMED/article/view/1088;1.6;1.2;1.3;16089693;;;;

The HIV Care Continuum and HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) among FSW has not been well studied in most countries in West Africa. In the current study we describe the HIV Care continuum and prevalence of HIVDR among FSW in Guinea-Bissau. Methods: A venue-based recruitment and peer-referral of FSW was used in seven cities in Guinea-Bissau from October 2014 to September 2017. We administered a questionnaire, performed discriminatory HIV-testing and collected blood specimens for CD4 count, viral load and HIVDR genotyping. Results: The survey included 440 FSW. The overall HIV-prevalence among FSW was 26.8%. Of the HIV-1 (HIV-1 single- or dually HIV-1/HIV-2) infected FSW (N = 104), 58.7% were previously diagnosed with HIV-1 at enrolment and 41.4% reported taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared to 28.6% of the HIV-2 single-infected FSW (N = 14). Among HIV-1 infected FSW on ART (N = 43), 55.8% were virally suppressed (&lt; 1000 copies/ml) and of all HIV-1 infected FSW, 29.8% were virally suppressed. Among ART experienced FSW (N = 22), 50.0% had HIVDR. HIVDR was also found in 9.4% of treatment naïve FSW (N = 53). Conclusion: The majority of FSW who knew their HIV status received ART, however a large proportion of FSW were not aware of their HIV positive status. This translated into a great majority of the HIV-infected FSW not being virally suppressed. Amongst treatment naïve FSW nearly a tenth had HIVDR, suggesting that sexual transmission of HIVDR is occurring in this at-risk-population.";https://aidsrestherapy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12981-020-00290-3;3.2;3.8;4.4;;;;;

Northwest region-Cameroon having the second epidemiological burden of HIV infection, generating data on PDR in these geographical settings, will enhance evidence-based decision-making. Objectives We sought to ascertain levels of PDR and HIV-1 clade dispersal in rural and urban settings, and their potential association with subtype distribution and CD4-staging. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to May 2017 among patients recently diagnosed with HIV-infection and initiating ART at the Bamenda regional Hospital (urban setting) and the Mbingo Baptist hospital (rural setting). Protease and reverse transcriptase sequencing was performed using an in-house protocol and pre-treatment drug resistance mutations were interpreted using Stanford HIVdb.v8.3. Phylogeny was performed for subtype assignation. Results A total of 61 patient sequences were generated from ART initiators (median age: 37 years old; 57.4% female; median CD4 cell count: 184 [IQR: 35–387] in urban vs. 161 [IQR: 96–322] cells/mm3 in rural). Overall, the level of PDR was 9.8% (6/61). Of note, burden of PDR was almost doubled in urban (12.9% [4/31]) compared to rural setting 6.7% (2/30), p = 0.352). Fifteen (15) PDR mutations were found among four patients the urban settings [6 resistance mutations to NRTIs:[M41L (2), E44D (1), K65R (1), K70E (1), M184V/I (2), K219R (1)] and 6 resistance mutations to NNRTIs: K103N (1), E138A/G (2), V179E (1), M230L (1), K238T (1), P225H (1)] against two (02) mutations found in two patients in the rural setting[2 resistant mutations to NNRTIs: E138A (1) and Y188H (1)]. The rural setting showed more genetic diversity (8 subtypes) than the urban setting (5 subtypes), with CRF02_AG being the most prevalent clade (72.1% [44/61]). Of note, level of PDR was similar between patients infected with CRF02_AG and non-CRF02_AG infected (9.1% [4/44]) vs. 11.8% [2/17]), p = 1.000). Moreover, PDR appeared higher in patients with CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm3 compared to those with CD4 cell count 200 cells/mm3 (14.7% [5/ 34]) vs. 3.7% [1/27]), p = 0.214). Conclusions PDR is at a moderate rate in the Northwest region of Cameroon, with higher burden within urban populations. CRF02_AG is the most predominant clade in both urban and rural settings. No effect of HIV molecular epidemiology and CD4-staging on the presence of PDR in patients living in these settings was found. Our findings suggest close monitoring, NNRTI-sparing regimens or sequencing for patients initiating ART, especially in urban settings.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235958;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

Evolution has enabled differentiation of species. Pathogens likewise have evolved within various species and mostly come to a settled dynamic equilibrium such that co-existence results (pathogens ideally should not kill their hosts). Problems arise when pathogens jump species because the new host had not developed any resistance. These infections from related species are known as zoonoses. COVID-19 is the latest example of a virus entering another species but HIV (and various strains of influenza) were previous examples. HIV entered the human population from monkeys in Africa. These two papers outline the underlying principle of HIV and the differing epidemiologies in Africa, the USA and in Edinburgh. The underlying immunosuppression of HIV in Africa was initially hidden behind common infections and HIV first came to world awareness in focal areas of the USA as a disease seemingly limited to gay males. The epidemic of intravenous drug abuse in Edinburgh was associated with overlapping epidemics of bloodborne viruses like hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.;https://pmj.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-137923;3.2;3.2;3.6;;;;;

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is associated with proximal renal tubular dysfunction, proteinuria and decrease in glomerular function. Studies in developed countries have shown variable prevalence of proximal renal tubular dysfunction in children on TDF. There are no known studies in developing countries, including Zimbabwe, documenting the proximal tubular function in HIV infected children on TDF. The aim of this study was to assess renal and proximal renal tubular function in HIV infected children receiving TDF and determine factors associated with proximal tubular dysfunction. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in HIV infected patients below 18 years of age attending outpatient clinics at two tertiary hospitals in Harare, who received a TDFcontaining antiretroviral regimen for at least six months. Dipstick protein and glucose, serum and urine phosphate and creatinine levels were measured. Fractional excretion of phosphate was calculated. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Schwartz formula. Tubular dysfunction was defined by at least two of the following characteristics: Normoglycaemic glycosuria, hypophosphatemia and fractional excretion of phosphate >18%. Findings One hundred and ninety-eight children below 18 years of age were recruited over a period of six months. The prevalence of tubular dysfunction was 0.5%. Normoglycaemic glycosuria occurred in 1 (0.5%), fractional excretion of phosphate >18% in 4 (2%), and hypophosphatemia in 22 [11.1%] patients. Severe stunting was associated with increased risk of hypophosphatemia (OR 9.31 CI (1.18, 80.68) p = 0.03). Reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 90ml/min/1.73m2 and proteinuria was evident in 35.9% and 32.8% of children, respectively. Concurrent TDF and HIV-1 protease inhibitor-based regimen was the only independent factor associated with reduction in GFR (OR 4.43 CI (1.32; 4.89) p = 0.016). Conclusion Tubular dysfunction was uncommon in Zimbabwean children on a TDF-based ART regimen. Hypophosphatemia, proteinuria and reduction in eGFR were common. Reassessing renal function using more sensitive biomarkers is needed to examine the long-term tolerance of TDF.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235759;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

Transmission initiated by infected cells has been shown by several in vitro and in vivo studies and a reduced capacity of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) to inhibit cell-to-cell transmission has also been reported. However, due to limitations of available experimental models, there is yet no clarity to which extend bNAbs can prevent transmission mediated by semen leukocytes. Methods: We developed a novel in vitro assay to measure cell-cell transmission that makes use of splenocytes or CD45+ semen leukocytes collected from acutely SHIV162P3-infected cynomolgus macaques. A panel of 11 bNAbs was used either alone or in combination to assess their inhibitory potential against both cell-free and cell-cell infection. Findings: Splenocytes and semen leucocytes displayed a similar proportion of CD4+ T-cell subsets. Either cell type transferred infection in vitro to target TZM-bl cells and PBMCs. Moreover, infection of macaques was achieved following intravaginal challenge with splenocytes. The anti-N-glycans/V3 loop bNAb 10–1074 was highly efficient against cell-associated transmission mediated by infected spleen cells and its potency was maintained when transmission was mediated by CD45+ semen leukocytes. Interpretation: These results support the use of bNAbs in preventative or therapeutic studies aiming to block transmission events mediated not only by free viral particles but also by infected cells.

Our all-atom molecular dynamics simulations show that the counter-anion condensation around the basic functional groups and the solvent accessible surface area of the peptide show non-monotonic dependence on biphosphate concentration. There is an optimum concentration of biphosphate ions in solution where the condensation is maximum, while the solvent exposed area is minimum. Thus, we show that the solvent exposure of the macromolecule can be controlled by tuning anion concentration in the solution which may help in designing drug delivery medium.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0009261420304188;3.1;3.1;3.5;00092614;S0009261420304188;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0009261420304188;;

However, when facing highly variable pathogens or antigens very similar to self-antigens, this system can fail in completely eliminating the anomalies, leading to the establishment of chronic pathologies. Prototypical examples of immune system defeat are cancer and Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. In both conditions, the immune system is persistently exposed to antigens leading to systemic inflammation, lack of generation of long-term memory and exhaustion of effector cells. This triggers a negative feedback loop where effector cells are unable to resolve the pathology and cannot be replaced due to the lack of a pool of undifferentiated, self-renewing memory T cells. In addition, in an attempt to reduce tissue damage due to chronic inflammation, antigen presenting cells and myeloid components of the immune system activate systemic regulatory and tolerogenic programs. Beside these homologies shared between cancer and HIV-1 infection, the immune system can be shaped differently depending on the type and distribution of the eliciting antigens with ultimate consequences at the phenotypic and functional level of immune exhaustion. T cell differentiation, functionality, cytotoxic potential and proliferation reserve, immune-cell polarization, upregulation of negative regulators (immune checkpoint molecules) are indeed directly linked to the quantitative and qualitative differences in priming and recalling conditions. Better understanding of distinct mechanisms and functional consequences underlying disease-specific immune cell dysfunction will contribute to further improve and personalize immunotherapy. In the present review, we describe relevant players of immune cell exhaustion in cancer and HIV-1 infection, and enumerate the best-defined hallmarks of T cell dysfunction. Moreover, we highlight shared and divergent aspects of T cell exhaustion and T cell activation to the best of current knowledge.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01350/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;;;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The human retroviral-like aspartic protease 1 (ASPRV1) is a mammalian retroviral-like enzyme that catalyzes a critical proteolytic step during epidermal differentiation; therefore, it is also referred to as skin-specific aspartic protease (SASPase). Neutrophil granulocytes were also found recently to express ASPRV1 that is involved in the progression of acute chronic inflammation of the central nervous system, especially in autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Thus, investigation of ASPRV1 is important due to its therapeutic or diagnostic potential. We investigated the structural characteristics of ASPRV1 by homology modeling; analysis of the proposed structure was used for interpretation of in vitro specificity studies. For in-vitro characterization, activities of SASP28 and SASP14 enzyme forms were measured using synthetic oligopeptide substrates. We demonstrated that self-processing of SASP28 precursor causes autoactivation of the protease. The highest activity was measured for GST-SASP14 at neutral pH and at high ionic strength, and we proved that pepstatin A and acetyl-pepstatin can also inhibit the protease. In agreement with the structural characteristics, the relatively lower urea dissociation constant implied lower dimer stability of SASP14 compared to that of HIV-1 protease. The obtained structural and biochemical characteristics support better understanding of ASPRV1 function in the skin and central nervous system.";https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/7/1004;8.8;8.5;2.3;;;;;

This holds very true for HIV-1 protease specificity problem where only a few experimentally verified cleavage sites are present. The challenge then is to exploit the auxiliary data. However, the problem becomes more complicated when the underlying train and test data are generated from different distributions. To deal with the challenges, we formulate the HIV-1 protease cleavage site prediction problem into a bi-objective optimization problem and solving it by introducing a multiobjective evolutionary-based multi-kernel model. A solution for the optimization problem will lead us to decide the optimal number of base kernels with the best pairing of features. The bi-objective criteria encourage different individual kernels in the ensemble to mitigate the effect of distribution difference in training and test data with the ideal number of base kernels. In this paper, we considered eight different feature descriptors and three different kernel variants of support vector machines to generate the optimal multi-kernel learning model. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II is employed with bi-objective of achieving a maximum area under the receiver operating characteristic curve simultaneously with a minimum number of features. To validate the effectiveness of the model, the experiments were performed on four HIV-1 protease datasets. The performance comparison with fifteen state-of-the-art techniques on average accuracy and area under curve has been evaluated to justify the improvement of the proposed model. We then analyze Friedman and post hoc tests to demonstrate the significant improvement. The result obtained following the extensive experiment enumerates the bi-objective multi-kernel model performance enhancement on within and cross-learning over the other state-of-the-art techniques.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00500-019-04487-1;3.2;3.9;4.7;14327643;;;;

DRV trough values were also investigated. SETTING: Prospective, multicenter, single-country, noninterventional cohort study. METHODS: This study included patients on a PI/r-based ART for at least 12 months having plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL since at least 6 months. The primary endpoint, defined as HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL, was measured at 48 ± 6 weeks from baseline. A secondary analysis was performed using the time to loss of virological response algorithm. Biochemical parameters, including DRV trough samples, were collected as per clinical practice and measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Of 336 patients enrolled, 282 completed the study: 70.8% had plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks; using the time to loss of virological response algorithm, 82.7% maintained virological suppression. Virological failure was observed in 6 patients (1.8%). Adverse event-related discontinuations were 4.5%. After 48 weeks, we found a significant improvement in both triglycerides (median, 130 to 113.5 mg/dL, P = 0.0254) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (48 to 49 mg/dL, P < 0.0001) but no change in other biomarkers. DRV trough concentrations in 56 subjects showed a median value of 2862.5 (1469.5-4439) ng/mL, higher in women than in men (4221 vs. 2634 ng/mL, P = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: In stable HIV-1 positive virologically suppressed patients, the switch to DRV/c-based ART was beneficial in terms of low rates of virological failure and adverse events due to its high tolerability and improvement in triglycerides.";https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAI.0000000000002331;6.9;7.0;6.4;;;;;

Such cell culture-derived patient-specific autologous stem cells are needed for transplantation. Here we report deriving HIV-1-infected patients' iPSC lines under transgene-free methods and under feeder-free and xeno-free culture conditions to meet the requirement for clinical application. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have reprogrammed patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells with EBNA1/OriP episomal vectors, or a defective and persistent Sendai virus vector (SeVdp) to ensure a nonintegrating iPSC generation. Both single picked and pooled iPSC lines demonstrated high pluripotency and were able to differentiate into various lineage cells in vivo. The established cell lines could be modified by genetic editing using the TALENs or CRISPR/Cas 9 technology to have a bi-allelic CCR532 mutations seamlessly. All generated iPSC lines and modified cell lines had no evidence of HIV integration and maintained normal karyotype after expansion. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a reproducible simple procedure for generating therapeutic grade iPSCs from HIV-infected patients and for engineering these cells to possess a naturally occurring genotype for resistance to HIV-1 infection when differentiated into immune cells.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAD.0000000000002535;8.8;7.1;7.5;;;;;

In this paper, we generalize continuous mathematical models of drug therapy for HIV-1 by Perelson et al. (Science 271:1582–1586, 1996) and Perelson and Nelson (SIAM Rev 41:3–44, 1999) on time scales, i.e., a nonempty closed subset of real numbers in order to derive new discrete models that predict the total concentration of plasma virus as a function of time. One of our main goals is to compare discrete mathematical models with the continuous model in Perelson et al. (1996) where HIV infected patients were given protease inhibitors and sampled frequently thereafter. For the comparison, we use experimental data collected in Perelson et al. (1996) and estimate the parameters such as the virion clearance rate and the rate of loss of infected cells by fitting the total concentration of plasma virus to this data set. Our results show that discrete systems describe the best fit. In the previous models of this study, the efficacy of protease inhibitor is assumed to be perfect. Motivated by Perelson and Nelson (1999), we end the paper with a mathematical model of imperfect protease inhibitor and reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor combination therapy of HIV-1 infection on time scales with its stability analysis.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00285-020-01492-z;3.2;3.4;3.5;03036812;;;;

Therefore, a constant and timely effort is needed to identify new HIV-1 inhibitors active against drug-resistant variants. The ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is a very promising target, but to date, still lacks an efficient inhibitor. Here, we characterize the mode of action of N'-(2-hydroxy-benzylidene)-3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoylhydrazone (compound 13), an N-acylhydrazone derivative that inhibited viral replication (EC50 = 10 M), while retaining full potency against the NNRTI-resistant double mutant K103N-Y181C virus. Time-of-addition and biochemical assays showed that compound 13 targeted the reverse-transcription step in cell-based assays and inhibited the RT-associated RNase H function, being >20-fold less potent against the RT polymerase activity. Docking calculations revealed that compound 13 binds within the RNase H domain in a position different from other selective RNase H inhibitors; site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed interactions with conserved amino acid within the RNase H domain, suggesting that compound 13 can be taken as starting point to generate a new series of more potent RNase H selective inhibitors active against circulating drug-resistant variants.";https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/7/729;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.Although the first HIV circulating recombinant form (CRF01_AE) is the predominant strain in many Asian countries, it is uncommonly found in the Congo Basin from where it first originated. To fill the gap in the evolutionary history of this important strain, we sequenced near complete genomes from HIV samples with subgenomic CRF01_AE regions collected in Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 2001 to 2006. HIV genomes were generated from N = 13 plasma specimens by next-generation sequencing of metagenomic libraries prepared with spiked primers targeting HIV, followed by Sanger gap-filling. Genome sequences were aligned to reference strains, including Asian and African CRF01_AE sequences, and evaluated by phylogenetic and recombinant analysis to identify four CRF01_AE strains from Cameroon. We also identified two CRF02, one CRF27, and six unique recombinant form genomes (01|A1|G, 01|02|F|U, F|G|01, A1|D|01, F|G|01, and A1|G|01). Phylogenetic analysis, including the four new African CRF01_AE genomes, placed these samples as a bridge between basal Central African Republic CRF01_AE strains and all Asian, European, and American CRF01_AE strains.

NGS methods have the potential for a more sensitive detection of low-abundance variants (LAV) compared to standard Sanger sequencing (SS) methods. A standardized threshold for reporting LAV that generates data comparable to those derived from SS is needed to allow for the comparability of data from laboratories using NGS and SS. Ten HIV-1 specimens were tested in ten laboratories using Illumina MiSeq-based methods. The consensus sequences for each specimen using LAV thresholds of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% were compared to each other and to the consensus of the SS sequences (protease 4 99; reverse transcriptase 38 247). The concordance among laboratories sequences at different thresholds was evaluated by pairwise sequence comparisons. NGS sequences generated using the 20% threshold were the most similar to the SS consensus (average 99.6% identity, range 96.1 100%), compared to 15% (99.4%, 88.5 100%), 10% (99.2%, 87.4 100%) or 5% (98.5%, 86.4 100%). The average sequence identity between laboratories using thresholds of 20%, 15%, 10%, and 5% was 99.1%, 98.7%, 98.3%, and 97.3%, respectively. Using the 20% threshold we observed an excellent agreement between NGS and SS, but significant differences at lower thresholds. Understanding how variation in NGS methods influences sequence quality is essential for NGS-based HIV-1 drug resistance genotyping.";https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/7/694;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

Therefore, database holders may want to share their databases with other organizations. However, since a database contains information about individuals, database recipients must take privacy concerns into consideration. One of the mainstream privacy protection indicators, l-diversity, guarantees that the probability of identifying a sensitive attribute value of an individual in a database is less than 1/l. However, when there are several semantically similar values in the sensitive attribute, there is a possibility that actual diversity is not satisfied, even if anonymization is performed to satisfy l-diversity. For example, an attacker may know that candidates of Alice's disease are a set of HIV-1(M), HIV-1(N), and HIV-2 if the anonymized database satisfies 3-diversity. In this case, the attacker can conclude that Alice has HIV, although the detailed type remains unknown. In this research, to solve how actual diversity cannot be taken into consideration with existing l-diversity, we proposed a novel privacy indicator, (l, d)-semantic diversity, and an algorithm that anonymizes a database to satisfy (l, d)-semantic diversity. We also proposed an analysis algorithm that is suitable for the proposed anonymizing algorithm because the output of the anonymizing algorithm is difficult to understand. Our proposed algorithms were experimentally evaluated using synthetic and real datasets.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167404820300973;5.7;6.2;7.5;01674048;S0167404820300973;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0167404820300973;;

Twenty-two samples were collected after failure on an INSTI-based regimen in 17 highly treatment-experienced patients with HIV-1 with multi-drug-resistant virus, recorded in the Italian PRESTIGIO registry. Genotypic resistance mutations and phenotypic susceptibility to INSTIs were detected by GeneSeqIN and PhenoSenseIN assays, respectively (Monogram Biosciences, San Francisco, CA, USA). The primary INSTI resistance substitutions E138A/K, G140S, Y143C/H/R, Q148H and N155H were detected in 14 of 22 samples and were associated with resistance to one or more INSTIs, with G140S+Q148H present in 11 of 22 samples. Of these 14 samples, all showed high levels of resistance to elvitegravir (EVG) and RAL. Two isolates contained L74M, E138K, G140S and Q148H, or L74M, T97A, S119T, E138K, G140S, Y143R and Q148H, and had high-level resistance to all INSTIs, including BIC and DTG. Intermediate resistance was reported for eight of 14 isolates for BIC and nine of 14 isolates for DTG. Overall, for the 14 INSTI-resistant isolates, the median fold-change values in phenotypic susceptibility were: BIC 3.2 [interquartile range (IQR) 0.6–66], DTG 6.3 (IQR 0.8–>186), EVG >164 (IQR 2.6–>164) and RAL >188 (IQR 2.7–>197). In conclusion, the study findings supported the in-vitro activity of BIC and DTG against most isolates derived from highly treatment-experienced patients who failed INSTI regimens.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0924857920301904;6.5;6.6;6.7;09248579;S0924857920301904;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0924857920301904;;

Objective: To explore the effectiveness and safety, in particular NP-AEs, of DTG/ABC/3TC in a cohort of HIV-1 adult infected patients. Pill burden, adherence to this STR, and the impact of switching on costs were also evaluated. Methods: This was an observational, retrospective study. The study population included antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive and treatment-experienced (TE) patients who started DTG/ABC/3TC between February 1, 2016, and October 31, 2016. Effectiveness and safety were analyzed at week 48 (W48) by intention-to-treat analysis. The Cox regression model was used to investigate predictors of DTG/ABC/3TC discontinuation. Results: A total of 253 patients were included (44 ART naïve, 209 TE). At W48, the proportion of patients with virological suppression was 72.7% (95% CI = 58.4-87.0) in ART-naive patients, 85.6% (95% CI = 80.3-90.9) in previously suppressed TE patients, and 86.4% (95% CI = 65.1-97.1) in previously not suppressed TE patients. The rate of protocol-defined virological failure was 4.3%. The incidence of AEs was higher in the subgroup of ART-naive patients (56.1% vs 39.0%), with a rate of interruptions for this reason of 13.6% and 7.6%, respectively. The incidence of NP-AEs was 20.6%, with 3.9% of patients requiring discontinuation. Patients who had switched from a raltegravir-containing regimen discontinued DTG/ABC/3TC because of AEs more frequently (relative risk = 2.83; 95% CI = 1.04-7.72; P = 0.041) in the multivariate analysis. After switching to DTG/ABC/3TC, the median pill burden was reduced from 3 to 1 and the proportion of patients with an adherence <90%, from 20.1% to 12.0%. The annual per-patient ART costs increased by €48 (0.6% increase). Conclusion and Relevance: DTG/ABC/3TC is an effective strategy as first-line and switching ART. Our data suggest a worse tolerance in ART-naive patients, although the rate of discontinuation resulting from NP-AEs was relatively low. In the short-term, the adherence was slightly improved without significant changes in costs.";http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1060028019896638;5.7;5.2;4.3;10600280;;;;

Little is known however about the natural variability in these Vpu functions among the genetically diverse viral subtypes that contribute to the HIV-1 pandemic. We collected Vpu isolates from 332 treatment-naive individuals living with chronic HIV-1 infection in Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa, and Canada. Together, these Vpu isolates represent four major HIV-1 group M subtypes (A [n = 63], B [n = 84], C [n = 94], and D [n = 59]) plus intersubtype recombinants and uncommon strains (n = 32). The ability of each Vpu clone to downregulate endogenous CD4 and tetherin was quantified using flow cytometry following transfection into an immortalized T-cell line and compared to that of a reference Vpu clone derived from HIV-1 subtype B NL4.3. Overall, the median CD4 downregulation function of natural Vpu isolates was similar to that of NL4.3 (1.01 [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.86 to 1.18]), while the median tetherin downregulation function was moderately lower than that of NL4.3 (0.90 [0.79 to 0.97]). Both Vpu functions varied significantly among HIV-1 subtypes (Kruskal-Wallis P < 0.0001). Specifically, subtype C clones exhibited the lowest CD4 and tetherin downregulation activities, while subtype D and B clones were most functional for both activities. We also identified Vpu polymorphisms associated with CD4 or tetherin downregulation function and validated six of these using site-directed mutagenesis. Our results highlight the marked extent to which Vpu function varies among global HIV-1 strains, raising the possibility that natural variation in this accessory protein may contribute to viral pathogenesis and/or spread. IMPORTANCE The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu enhances viral spread by downregulating CD4 and BST-2/tetherin on the surface of infected cells. Natural variability in these Vpu functions may contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis, but this has not been investigated among the diverse viral subtypes that contribute to the HIV-1 pandemic. In this study, we found that Vpu function differs significantly among HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, and D. On average, subtype C clones displayed the lowest ability to downregulate both CD4 and tetherin, while subtype B and D clones were more functional. We also identified Vpu polymorphisms that associate with functional differences among HIV-1 isolates and subtypes. Our study suggests that genetic diversity in Vpu may play an important role in the differential pathogenesis and/or spread of HIV-1.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/14/e00293-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

In this study, we explore the possibility of surface modification of Lactoferrin nanoparticles to hone its specificity to target HIV-1 infected cells. Existence of free cysteine groups on Lactoferrin nanoparticles available for reaction with external molecules facilitates conjugation on the surface with Sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MES). Conjugation with MES is used to edge a negative charge that can mimic CCR5 and Heparan sulfate (initial point of contact of HIV-1 env to host cell surface) electrostatic charge (Sulfate group). A simple sono-chemical irradiation method was employed for self-assembly of Nanoparticles and for surface modification. The nanoparticles serve dual purpose to abrogate extracellular entry and to target viral enzymes, when loaded with ART drugs. The morphology and size distribution of the formed particles were explored using Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Dynamic Light Scattering. Raman SERS was employed to understand the difference in the protein upon surface modification. The anti-HIV property of the particles was confirmed in-vitro. The modified device demonstrated acceptable nanoparticle properties with controlled release and higher effective concentration in the area of infection.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0927776520302095;7.2;7.0;7.1;09277765;S0927776520302095;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0927776520302095;;

The process of viral fusion appears to be fast compared with viral egress and has not been visualized by EM. To capture fusion events, the process must be curtailed by trapping Env-receptor binding at an intermediate stage. We have used fusion inhibitors to trap HIV-1 virions attached to target cells by Envs in an extended pre-hairpin intermediate state. Electron tomography revealed HIV-1 virions bound to TZM-bl cells by 2–4 narrow spokes, with slightly more spokes present when evaluated with mutant virions that lacked the Env cytoplasmic tail.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Despite combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) achieving efficient HIV replication control, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) continue to be highly prevalent in HIV-infected patients. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a well-known comorbidity of HAND in HIV-infected patients. Blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction has been linked recently to dementia development, specifically in DM patients. BBB injury exists both in HIV and DM, likely contributing to cognitive decline. However, its extent, exact cellular targets and mechanisms are largely unknown. In this report, we found a decrease in pericyte coverage and expression of tight junction proteins in human brain tissues from HIV patients with DM and evidence of HAND when compared to HIV-infected patients without DM or seronegative DM patients. Using our in vitro BBB models, we demonstrated diminution of barrier integrity, enhanced monocyte adhesion, changes in cytoskeleton and overexpression of adhesion molecules in primary human brain endothelial cells or human brain pericytes after exposure to HIV and DM-relevant stimuli. Our study demonstrates for the first-time evidence of impaired BBB function in HIV-DM patients and shows potential mechanisms leading to it in brain endothelium and pericytes that may result in poorer cognitive performance compared to individuals without HIV and DM.;https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/13/4663;5.1;5.2;5.3;16616596;;;;

HIV-1 reactivation induced by the mere use of latency-reversing agents is insufficient to render death of reservoir cells, indicating that certain intrinsic survival mechanisms exist. We report that Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) plays a critical role in survival of CD4+ T cells that undergo HIV-1 reactivation from latency or de novo infection. PLK1 is elevated in both scenarios, which requires HIV-1 Nef. HIV-1 enhances PLK1 SUMOylation, causing its nuclear translocation and protein stabilization. Inhibition or knockdown of PLK1 markedly facilitates death of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, PLK1 inhibitors strikingly reduce the size of HIV-1 latent reservoirs in primary CD4+ T cells. Our findings demonstrate that HIV-1 infection hijacks PLK1 to prevent cell death induced by viral cytopathic effects, and that PLK1 is a promising target for chemical “killing” of HIV-1 reservoir cells.";https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aba1941;9.6;15.0;25.2;;;;;

The proarrhythmic potential of fostemsavir was studied in a thorough QT study and exposure–response modeling was performed at therapeutic and supratherapeutic concentrations of TMR. Fostemsavir 1,200 mg b.i.d. did not result in a clinically meaningful change from placebo in baseline-adjusted Fridericia-corrected QTc (ddQTcF); however, at a supratherapeutic dose of 2,400 mg b.i.d., the upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) of ddQTcF was 13.2 msec, exceeding the clinically important 10 msec threshold. A linear model of ddQTcF as a function of TMR plasma concentrations described these observations. Based on simulations with this model, TMR concentrations up to 7,500 ng/mL are expected to have an upper 90% CI bound for QTcF  10 msec. This concentration is 4.2-fold higher than the geometric mean TMR peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 1,770 ng/mL in heavily treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patients administered fostemsavir 600 mg b.i.d. in the phase III BRIGHTE study (NCT02362503).";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cts.12763;2.4;4.2;4.9;17528054;;;;

Opiate use is widespread in PWH and exacerbates neuroHIV. While neurons themselves are not infected, they incur sublethal damage and GABAergic disruption is selectively vulnerable to viral and inflammatory factors released by infected/affected glia. Here, we demonstrate diminished K+-Cl cotransporter 2 (KCC2) levels in primary human neurons after exposure to HIV-1 or HIV-1 proteins ± morphine. Resulting disruption of GABAAR-mediated hyperpolarization/inhibition was shown using genetically-encoded voltage (Archon1) and calcium (GCaMP6f) indicators. The HIV proteins Tat (acting through NMDA receptors) and R5-gp120 (acting via CCR5) but not X4-tropic gp120 (acting via CXCR4), and morphine (acting through -opioid receptors) all induced KCC2 loss. We demonstrate that modifying KCC2 levels or function, or antagonizing NMDAR, CCR5 or MOR rescues KCC2 and GABAAR-mediated hyperpolarization/inhibition in HIV, Tat, or gp120 ± morphine-exposed neurons. Using an inducible, Tat-transgenic mouse neuroHIV model, we found that chronic exposure to Tat also reduces KCC2. Our results identify KCC2 as a novel therapeutic target for ameliorating the pathobiology of neuroHIV, including PWH exposed to opiates.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0969996120301534;10.6;10.6;8.8;09699961;S0969996120301534;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0969996120301534;;

We have developed a long terminal repeat indexing-mediated integration site sequencing (LTRi-Seq) method that provides a multiplexed clonal quantitation of both anti-HIV-1 RNAi (RNA interference) gene-modified and control vector-modified cell populations, together with HIV-1-infected cells-all within the same animal. In our HIV-1-preinfected humanized mice, both therapeutic and control HSPCs repopulated efficiently without abnormalities. Although the HIV-1-mediated selection of anti-HIV-1 RNAi-modified clones was evident in HIV-1-infected mice, the organ-to-organ and intra-organ clonal distributions in infected mice were indistinguishable from those in uninfected mice. HIV-1-infected cells showed clonal patterns distinct from those of HSPCs. Our data demonstrate that, despite the substantial impact of HIV-1 infection on CD4+ T cells, HSPC repopulation remains polyclonal, thus supporting the use of HSPC transplant for anti-HIV treatment.";https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aay9206;9.6;15.0;25.2;;;;;

Four strains were found in this study, and another strain (XC2014EU01) was reported in a previous study. The phylogenetic analysis of the five near full-length genomes showed that a CRF08_BC segment was inserted into the CRF01_AE backbone with one recombinant breakpoint in the pol region, which is the first HIV-1 CRF of CRF01_AE and CRF08_BC. Three genetic sequences had drug-resistant mutations, E138Q and V179D, indicating that there were low resistance levels to efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP) in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture.

However, concerns about the safety and feasibility of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in HIV-1-infected individuals have led to the exclusion of these patients from clinical trials on cancer immunotherapies. Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of durvalumab treatment in patients with advanced cancer and virologically controlled HIV-1 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: The DURVAST study was a nonrandomized, open-label, phase 2 clinical trial in patients with any solid tumor type in which anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies have approved indications or for which there are data of antitumoral activity with no other available curative therapy. All patients had basal undetectable plasma viremia while undergoing combination antiretroviral therapy. Interventions: Treatment consisted of intravenous infusion of durvalumab (1500 mg every 4 weeks) until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. Main Outcomes and Measures: Adverse events were graded with the use of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. Tumor response was evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Results: A total of 20 HIV-1-infected patients with advanced cancer were enrolled; 16 (80%) were male, the median (range) age was 54 (30-73) years, and 12 (60%) had progressed with previous cancer treatment lines. A median (range) of 4 (1-16) cycles of durvalumab were administered. Drug-related adverse events were observed in 50% of patients, and all were grade 1 and 2 (mainly diarrhea, asthenia, and arthromyalgia). Four of 16 response-evaluable patients (25%) had a partial response. Five patients (31%) had stable disease, including 4 with durable stable disease (disease control rate of 50%). CD4+and CD8+T-cell counts and plasma HIV-1 viremia remained stable throughout the study. Conclusions and Relevance: Durvalumab treatment was feasible and safe in HIV-1-infected patients with cancer receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. HIV-1-infected patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy with advanced cancer should have access to cancer immunotherapy treatments.

We describe the clinical, virological, and immunological follow-up of a cohort of children and adolescents perinatally infected with HIV-1 treated at Hospital Estadual de Doenças Tropicais Dr. Anuar Auad - HDT, in Central Brazil, after therapeutic failure related to drug resistance mutations. We analyzed the results of the genotypic test (protease codons 1-99 and reverse transcriptase codons 1-325) performed from 2003 to 2015. The ARV susceptibility profile was analyzed according to Stanford HIV drug resistance database. A total of 65 patients (median age of 10 years; range, 18 m-18 y) with therapeutic failure (after a median of 55 months of follow up; range, 9 m-13 y) and plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA greater than 1,000 copies/mL which were included and demonstrated mutations in: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 98.5%; non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 75.4%; and protease inhibitors (PI), 44.6%. The most frequent NRTI mutations were found in codon T215 (83.1%) with a predominance of T215Y (56.9%), followed by M184V (69.3%). In the NNRTI class, mutations K103N (36.9%) and 190A (23.1%) were predominant, and, in the protease, mutations 54VL (35.4%) and 82ASTL (32.3%) were found in approximately the same proportion, with a predominance of the M54V mutation.

To gain insight into the influence of HLA-B*57:01 on the deterioration of CD8 T-cell responses during HIV infection in the absence of antiretroviral treatment, we compared HLA-B*57:01restricted HIV-specific CD8 T-cell responses to responses restricted by other HLA class I alleles longitudinally after control of peak viremia. Detailed characterization of polyfunctionality, differentiation phenotypes, transcription factor, and inhibitory receptor expression revealed progression of CD8 T-cell exhaustion over the course of the infection in both patient groups. However, early effects on the phenotype of the total CD8 T-cell population were apparent only in HLA-B*57-negative patients. The HLA-B*57:01-restricted, HIV epitope-specific CD8 T-cell responses showed beneficial functional patterns and significantly lower frequencies of inhibitory receptor expression, i.e., PD-1 and coexpression of PD-1 and TIGIT, within the first year of infection. Coexpression of PD-1 and TIGIT was correlated with clinical markers of disease progression and declining percentages of the T-bethi Eomesdim CD8 T-cell population. In accordance with clinical and immunological deterioration in the HLA-B*57:01 group, the difference in PD-1 and TIGIT receptor expression did not persist to later stages of the disease. IMPORTANCE Given the synergistic nature of TIGIT and PD-1, the coexpression of those inhibitory receptors should be considered when evaluating T-cell pathogenesis, developing immunomodulatory therapies or vaccines for HIV, and when using immunotherapy or vaccination for other causes in HIV-infected patients. HIV-mediated T-cell exhaustion influences the patient´s disease progression, immune system and subsequently non-AIDS complications, and efficacy of vaccinations against other pathogens. Consequently, the possibilities of interfering with exhaustion are numerous. Expanding the use of immunomodulatory therapies to include HIV treatment depends on information about possible targets and their role in the deterioration of the immune system. Furthermore, the rise of immunotherapies against cancer and elevated cancer incidence in HIV-infected patients together increase the need for detailed knowledge of T-cell exhaustion and possible interactions. A broader approach to counteract immune exhaustion to alleviate complications and improve efficacy of other vaccines also promises to increase patients’ health and quality of life.;None;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

We created a procedure for the use of the BioRad Geenius HIV-1/2 as a supplemental antibody test for oral fluid specimens. The modified procedure was evaluated for its ability to detect HIV-1 antibody in oral fluid in specimens that were found to be repeatedly reactive for HIV-1 antibody by way of the Avioq HIV-1 enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Evaluated were oral fluid specimens analyzed at a local public health laboratory which were stored frozen and oral fluid specimens collected prospectively. Prospectively collected specimens were from patients whose HIV status was subsequently assessed through blood-based testing. For retrospective specimens found repeatedly EIA reactive, and positive by Western blot, the modified Geenius was found positive in 37/38 instances (97.4 %). Those specimens with a mean EIA signal-to-cutoff (S/CO) greater than 3.00 were found to be positive by Geenius in 34/34 (100 %) of instances. For specimens found repeated reactive by EIA and positive by Western blot with mean S/CO less than or equal to 3.00, the Geenius was positive in 4/5 instances (80 %) of instances. For prospectively collected specimens, the Geenius accurately confirmed infection in 22/24 cases (92 %) while prospective specimens found repeatedly reactive by EIA without supplemental Geenius testing were confirmed positive in 29/37 instances (78 %).

Published by Cambridge University Press, 2020.Objective: There is lack of Cameroonian adult neuropsychological (NP) norms, limited knowledge concerning HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa, and evidence of differential inflammation and disease progression based on viral subtypes. In this study, we developed demographically corrected norms and assessed HIV and viral genotypes effects on attention/working memory (WM), learning, and memory.Method: We administered two tests of attention/WM [Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT)-50, Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS)-III Spatial Span] and two tests of learning and memory [Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R), Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R)] to 347 HIV+ and 395 seronegative adult Cameroonians. We assessed the effects of viral factors on neurocognitive performance.Results: Compared to controls, people living with HIV (PLWH) had significantly lower T-scores on PASAT-50 and attention/WM summary scores, on HVLT-R total learning and learning summary scores, on HVLT-R delayed recall, BVMT-R delayed recall and memory summary scores. More PLWH had impairment in attention/WM, learning, and memory. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) and current immune status had no effect on T-scores. Compared to untreated cases with detectable viremia, untreated cases with undetectable viremia had significantly lower (worse) T-scores on BVMT-R total learning, BVMT-R delayed recall, and memory composite scores.

All rights reserved.We evaluated natural resistance to the new antiretroviral fostemsavir and its potential association with other HIV-1 gp120 polymorphisms. Methods: A total of 1997 HIV-1 B subtype gp120 sequences from the Los Alamos HIV Database were analysed for mutation prevalence at fostemsavir resistance-associated positions and potential association with other gp120 polymorphisms. The role of each fostemsavir resistance-related position and the correlated gp120 mutations, both in protein stability and in reducing the binding affinity between antibody and/or T cell lymphocyte epitopes and the MHC molecules, was estimated. Results: The prevalence of fostemsavir resistance mutations was as follows: L116Q (0.05%), S375H/M/T (0.55%/1.35%/17.73%, the latter being far less relevant in determining resistance), M426L (7.56%), M434I (4.21%) and M475I (1.65%). Additionally, the M426R polymorphism had a prevalence of 16.32%. A significantly higher prevalence in X4 viruses versus R5 viruses was found only for S375M (0.69% versus 3.93%, P = 0.009) and S375T (16.60% versus 22.11%, P = 0.030). Some fostemsavirv resistance positions positively and significantly correlated with specific gp120 polymorphisms: S375T with I371V; S375M with L134W, I154V and I323T; M475I with K322A; and M426R with G167N, K192T and S195N. The topology of the dendrogram suggested the existence of three distinct clusters (bootstrap 0.98) involving these fostemsavir resistance mutations and gp120 polymorphisms. Interestingly, all clustered mutations are localized in class I/II-restricted T cell/antibody epitopes, suggesting a potential role in immune HIV escape. Conclusions: A low prevalence of known fostemsavir resistance mutations was found in the HIV-1 B subtype. The detection of novel HIV-1 gp120 polymorphisms potentially relevant for fostemsavir resistance deserves new in-depth in vitro investigations.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/7/1778/5803149;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;;

All Rights Reserved.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) exploits a number of specialized microtubule (MT) plus-end tracking proteins (commonly known as +TIPs) to induce the formation of stable microtubules soon after virus entry and promote early stages of infection. However, given their functional diversity, the nature of the +TIPs involved and how they facilitate HIV-1 infection remains poorly understood. Here, we identify cytoplasmic linker-associated protein 2 (CLASP2), a +TIP that captures cortical MT plus ends to enable filament stabilization, as a host factor that enables HIV-1 to induce MT stabilization and promote early infection in natural target cell types. Using fixed- and live-cell imaging in human microglia cells, we further show that CLASP2 is required for the trafficking of incoming HIV-1 particles carrying wild-type (WT) envelope. Moreover, both WT CLASP2 and a CLASP2 mutant lacking its C-terminal domain, which mediates its interaction with several host effector proteins, bind to intact HIV-1 cores or in vitro-assembled capsid-nucleocapsid (CA-NC) complexes. However, unlike WT CLASP2, the CLASP2 C-terminal mutant is unable to induce MT stabilization or promote early HIV-1 infection. Our findings identify CLASP2 as a new host cofactor that utilizes distinct regulatory domains to bind incoming HIV-1 particles and facilitate trafficking of incoming viral cores through MT stabilization. IMPORTANCE While microtubules (MTs) have long been known to be important for delivery of incoming HIV-1 cores to the nucleus, how the virus engages and exploits these filaments remains poorly understood. Our previous work revealed the importance of highly specialized MT regulators that belong to a family called plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) in facilitating early stages of infection. These +TIPs perform various functions, such as engaging cargos for transport or engaging peripheral actin to stabilize MTs, suggesting several family members have the potential to contribute to infection in different ways. Here, we reveal that cytoplasmic linker-associated protein 2 (CLASP2), a key regulator of cortical capture and stabilization of MTs, interacts with incoming HIV-1 particles, and we identify a distinct C-terminal domain in CLASP2 that promotes both MT stabilization and early infection. Our findings identify a new +TIP acting as a host cofactor that facilitates early stages of viral infection.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/14/e00404-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

However, the characteristics of anti-HIV antibody response in the subjects who are treated during chronic HIV-1 infection (CHI) have not yet been fully investigated. Methods: Different anti-HIV antibodies were longitudinally quantified and analyzed in 81 CHI adults under ART. The factors associated with antibody decline were evaluated by binary logistic regression analysis. Results: ART led to 36.0% (27/75) and 52.1% (38/73) of the patients whose anti-HIV levels reduced by more than 75% of the baseline levels at 12 and 24 months post-ART, respectively. The reduction of anti-HIV antibodies correlated with the decline of HIV-1 viral load with correlation coefficients in the range 0.5560.848 or R2 value of 0.5760.873 (P < 0.001). However, no negative detection of anti-HIV antibody was observed at 24 months post-ART. The time from HIV-1 diagnosis to ART initiation and the baseline anti-HIV levels were the key factors associated with quick decline of anti-HIV antibodies during ART. Conclusions: ART-induced kinetics of anti-HIV antibody response was different among the subjects with AHI and CHI. Misdiagnosis of HIV-1 infection may not be a serious issue in HIV-1 chronically infected subjects under ART, and could ideally be avoided by using multiple HIV-1 antigens for screening purposes.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1386653220301566;5.7;6.0;5.9;13866532;S1386653220301566;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1386653220301566;;

All Rights Reserved.HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimers, stabilized in a prefusion-closed conformation, can elicit humoral responses capable of neutralizing HIV-1 strains closely matched in sequence to the immunizing strain. One strategy to increase elicited neutralization breadth involves vaccine priming of immune responses against a target site of vulnerability, followed by vaccine boosting of these responses with prefusion-closed Env trimers. This strategy has succeeded at the fusion peptide (FP) site of vulnerability in eliciting cross-clade neutralizing responses in standard vaccine-test animals. However, the breadth and potency of the elicited responses have been less than optimal. Here, we identify three mutations (3mut), Met302, Leu320, and Pro329, that stabilize the apex of the Env trimer in a prefusion-closed conformation and show antigenically, structurally, and immunogenically that combining 3mut with other approaches (e.g., repair and stabilize and glycine-helix breaking) yields well-behaved clade C-Env trimers capable of boosting the breadth of FP-directed responses. Crystal structures of these trimers confirmed prefusion-closed apexes stabilized by hydrophobic patches contributed by Met302 and Leu320, with Pro329 assuming canonically restricted dihedral angles. We substituted the N-terminal eight residues of FP (FP8, residues 512 to 519) of these trimers with the second most prevalent FP8 sequence (FP8v2, AVGLGAVF) and observed a 3mut-stabilized consensus clade C-Env trimer with FP8v2 to boost the breadth elicited in Guinea pigs of FP-directed responses induced by immunogens containing the most prevalent FP8 sequence (FP8v1, AVGIGAVF). Overall, 3mut can stabilize the Env trimer apex, and the resultant apex-stabilized Env trimers can be used to expand the neutralization breadth elicited against the FP site of vulnerability. IMPORTANCE A major hurdle to the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine is the elicitation of serum responses capable of neutralizing circulating strains of HIV, which are extraordinarily diverse in sequence and often highly neutralization resistant. Recently, we showed how sera with 20 to 30% neutralization breadth could, nevertheless, be elicited in standard vaccine test animals by priming with the most prevalent N-terminal 8 residues of the HIV-1 fusion peptide (FP8), followed by boosting with a stabilized BG505-envelope (Env) trimer. Here, we show that subsequent boosting with a 3mut-apex-stabilized consensus C-Env trimer, modified to have the second most prevalent FP8 sequence, elicits higher neutralization breadth than that induced by continued boosting with the stabilized BG505-Env trimer. With increased neutralizing breadth elicited by boosting with a heterologous trimer containing the second most prevalent FP8 sequence, the fusion peptide-directed immune-focusing approach moves a step closer toward realizing an effective HIV-1 vaccine regimen.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/13/e00074-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

All Rights Reserved.Anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (anti-HIV-1) fusion peptides have been studied for nearly 2 decades, but few candidates have found useful clinical applications. One factor underlying the failure of such agents to reach the clinic is their poor pharmacokinetic properties, and many efforts have been made to overcome this problem. In this study, we modified C34, a peptide inhibitor of HIV-1 fusion, at its conserved glycosylation site using polyethylene glycols (PEGs) of different molecular weights. PEG40-NC, a conjugate of C34 and branched PEG 40 kDa (PEG40), which has been previously shown to improve the pharmacokinetic profiles of proteins, showed a significantly extended half-life (t1/2; 10.39 h in rats), which compensated for decreased in vitro activity (50% effective concentration [EC50] of 18.51 nM). PEG40-NC also showed a mechanism of action similar to that of C34. PEG40-NC monotherapy in acutely simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected rhesus monkeys significantly suppressed viral load compared with a control treatment. Efficacy was linked to the extended half-life and lymphatic exposure conferred by attached PEG40. These results highlight the potential of further clinical investigations of PEG40-NC in combination with antiretroviral therapy or other anti-HIV agents. IMPORTANCE Poor pharmacokinetics have severely hindered the clinical use of anti-HIV peptides. Different small molecules, such as lipid, cholesterol, and small PEG, were designed to modify peptides to improve their pharmacokinetics. In this study, we incorporated large branched PEG to anti-HIV peptide and obtained a conjugate with extended half-life and improved in vivo efficacy. The strategy we developed in this study can also be applicable for the development of other peptide candidates.";https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/14/e00386-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

Objective: To investigate the characteristics of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and the extent of changes in drug susceptibility among ART-experienced CRF55_01B-infected adults of Guangdong. Methods: ADR was tested for immediately in CRF55_01B-infected patients with virological failure. Demographic and epidemiological information was collected. DRMs and antiretroviral susceptibility were interpreted using the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database HIVdb program. Results: Overall, 162 (4.78%) CRF55_01B isolates were identified from 2013 to 2018. Among DRMs, M184V (43.83%) was the most frequent NRTI DRM, followed by K65R (23.46%), and V179E (98.77%) was the most frequent NNRTI DRM, followed by K103N (47.53%) and Y181C (14.81%). According to the HIVdb program, 79.01% of the CRF55_01B-infected patients carried mutations conferring low-level or higher drug resistance to any of the three classes of ART drugs. Among PI DRMs, only one mutation affording low-level resistance to nelfinavir was found (0.62%). Among NRTI DRMs, a high proportion of high-level resistance to lamivudine (58.64%) and emtricitabine (58.02%) was found. As regards NNRTIs, more than 75% of patients carried efavirenz and nevirapine DRMs. The percentages of high-level resistance were 70.99%, 63.58%, 22.22%, 17.90% and 4.32% for nevirapine, efavirenz, rilpivirine, doravirine and etravirine, respectively. Conclusions: High frequencies of DRMs and resistance were observed among CRF55_01B-infected patients failing ART in Guangdong, and interventions may be considered to minimize ecological contributions to ART.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/7/1925/5821043;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;;

In this work, we have taken advantage of the antigen presenting cell role of human dendritic cells (DCs) to try to induce an immune response to HIV-derived peptide delivered to DCs using two different polycationic nanoparticles: a G4 PAMAM dendrimer modified to a 70/30 ratio of hydroxyl groups/amines and a cyclodextrin derivative. We have studied peptide delivery using a fluorescence peptide and have studied the immune response generation by cytokine determination and flow cytometry. We have found a robust delivery of the antigenic peptide to DCs and activated dendritic cell-mediated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) proliferation using the mixed lymphocyte reaction. However, no expression of markers indicating activation of either B or T lymphocytes was observed. Moreover, the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF- or IL-2 was only observed when DCs treated with either the dendrimer or the dendriplex containing the peptide. Antigenic peptide delivery to DCs is a promising approach to generate a vaccine against HIV-1 infection. However, more studies, including the simultaneous delivery of several antigenic peptides from different viral proteins, can markedly improve the immune response.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/12/7/656;5.2;2.9;2.9;;;;;

Acute HIV infection induces robust inflammatory responses, which are insufficient to prevent or eliminate virus in mucosal tissues. While establishment of viral set-point is coincident with downregulation of acute innate responses, systemic inflammatory responses persist during the course of chronic HIV infection. Since the introduction of combination antiviral therapy (cART), most HIV-1+ individuals can suppress viremia under detection levels for decades. However, chronic immune activation persists and has been postulated to cause HIV associated non-AIDS complications (HANA). Importantly, inflammatory cytokines and activation markers associated with macrophages are strongly and selectively correlated with the incidence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), cardiovascular dysfunctions (CVD) and other HANA conditions.

To test this hypothesis we compiled data on the top opportunistic infections and causes of early death in the HIV cohort of French Guiana. Methods: HIV-infected persons followed in Cayenne, Kourou, and Saint Laurent du Maroni hospitals from 2010 to 2019 were studied. Annual incidence of different opportunistic infections and annual deaths are compiled. For patients with opportunistic infections we calculated the proportion of early deaths. Results: At the time of analysis, among 2 459 patients, (treated and untreated) 90% had a viral load <400 copies, 91% of the patients in the cohort were on antiretroviral treatment, and 94.2% of patients on treatment for over 6 months had undetectable viral loads. Only 9% of patients had CD4 counts under 200 per mm3. Histoplasmosis clearly remained the most frequent (128 cases) opportunistic infection among HIV-infected persons followed by cerebral toxoplasmosis (63 cases) and esophageal candidiasis (41 cases). Cryptococcal meningitis was ranked 5th most frequent opportunistic infection as was tuberculosis (31 cases). The trend for a sharp decline in early deaths continued (3.9% of patients). Conclusions: Despite the successes of antiretrovirals, patients presenting with advanced HIV are still common and they are still at risk of dying. Improved diagnosis, and notably systematic screening with appropriate tools are still important areas of potential progress.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236368;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

All rights reserved.Objectives: The main objectives of the study are to estimate HIV prevalence, active syphilis prevalence, and correlates of co-infection with HIV in Zambia, among recently sexually active individuals aged 15 to 59 years old. Methods: We used data from the 2016 Zambia Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (ZAMPHIA), a national household survey that included biomarker testing for HIV and syphilis. Chembio DPP® Syphilis Screen and Confirm Assay was used to distinguish between active and older syphilis infections. This is the first time Chembio DPP® has been used in a national survey. Log-binominal modelling was utilized to understand the risk of acquiring HIV/active syphilis co-infection using select socio-demographic and sexual behavior variables. Multivariable analysis compared those with co-infection and those with no infection. All reported results account for the complex survey design and are weighted. Results: A total of 19,114 individuals aged 15-59 years responded to the individual interview and had a valid syphilis and/or HIV test. The prevalence for those sexually active in the 12 months preceding ZAMPHIA 2016 was 3.5% and 13% for active syphilis and HIV, respectively. The prevalence of HIV/active syphilis co-infection was 1.5%. Factors associated with higher prevalence of co-infection versus no infection among females included, but were not limited to, those living in urban areas (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.8, 4.8), those had sexual intercourse before age 15 years (aPR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1, 2.9), and those who had two or more sexual partners in the 12 months preceding the survey (aPR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.6, 4.7). Conclusion: These findings show high prevalence for both mono-infection with HIV and syphilis, as well as co-infection with HIV/active syphilis in Zambia. There is a need for better screening and partner services, particularly among those engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors (e.g., engaging in transactional sex).;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236501;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

This study focused on the development and evaluation of a new PCR-based assay for the amplification and sequencing of the entire HIV-1 pol region of major circulating group M HIV-1 strains in Europe for genotypic drug resistance analysis. The comprehensive touchdown PCR assay developed in this study utilized HIV-1 RNA extracted from the plasma of blood samples of consenting HIV-1 infected patients in Cyprus, collected from 2017 to 2019. The HIV-1 pol region was amplified by touchdown PCR for both the primary RT-PCR and the secondary PCR steps. Successful PCR amplicons were determined by population DNA sequencing, using the Sanger method and the genotypic drug resistance analysis was performed with the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database Program. The newly developed assay successfully amplified the entire HIV-1 pol region (2844 nucleotides long) of 141 out of 144 samples of group M HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant strains of the Cyprus HIV-1 Transmission Cohort Study (CHICS) isolated from 2017 to 2019 and genotypic analyses were conducted for all currently available HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase inhibitors. The drug resistance, epidemiological and demographic data of these study subjects will be expanded upon in the CHICS (L.G. Kostrikis et al., manuscript in preparation for publication). The newly developed HIV-1 genotypic drug resistance assay would benefit clinical settings, and research focusing on the world-wide spread of HIV-1 drug-resistant strains, especially in geographic regions characterized by polyphyletic HIV-1 infections.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567134820300757;5.2;4.9;5.0;15671348;S1567134820300757;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1567134820300757;;

Methods: Multicentre, retrospective cohort study in nine hospitals in Spain. All HIV-infected subjects starting boosted darunavir plus rilpivirine were included, irrespective of their viral load (VL). The primary objective was the percentage of patients with VL <50copies/mL at 48 weeks. Secondary objectives included changes in CD4+ cell count, lipid profile and renal function. Results: Eighty-one of 84 patients reached Week 48. Fifty-nine (70.2%) patients had VL <50copies/mL at baseline and the rest had a median VL of 202 (IQR 98-340) copies/mL. Subjects had a median of 21 years of infection with six prior regimens. The main reasons for starting boosted darunavir plus rilpivirine were simplification (44%), kidney or bone toxicity (28.6%) and virological failure (17.9%). Historical genotypes from 47 patients showed 41 (87.2%) patients with NRTI RAMs, 21 (44.7%) with NNRTI RAMs, 12 (25.5%) with primary PI RAMs and 7 (14.9%) with integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) RAMs. One patient had low-level resistance to boosted darunavir and five patients had some resistance to rilpivirine. At 48 weeks, 71 (87.7%) patients had VL <50copies/mL. According to undetectable or detectable baseline VL, effectiveness was 91.1% or 80%, respectively. There were four virological failures with no emergence of new RAMs. Three of these patients resuppressed viraemia while maintaining the same regimen. Conclusions: The combination of boosted darunavir plus rilpivirine has shown good effectiveness and tolerability in this cohort of pretreated patients with a long-lasting HIV infection, exposure to multiple antiretroviral regimens and prior HIV resistance.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/7/1955/5781883;8.7;7.7;8.3;03057453;;;;

One strategy proposes to eliminate these viral reservoirs by pharmacologically reactivating the latently infected T cells. We show here that a 4-deoxyphorbol ester derivative isolated from Euphorbia amygdaloides ssp. semiperfoliata, 4-dPE A, reactivates HIV-1 from latency and could potentially contribute to decrease the viral reservoir. 4-dPE A shows two effects in the HIV replication cycle, infection inhibition and HIV transactivation, similarly to other phorboids PKC agonists such PMA and prostratin and to other diterpene esters such SJ23B. Our data suggest 4-dPE A is non-tumorigenic, unlike the related compound PMA. As the compounds are highly similar, the lack of tumorigenicity by 4-dPE A could be due to the lack of a long side lipophilic chain that is present in PMA. 4-dPE activates HIV transcription at nanomolar concentrations, lower than the concentration needed by other latency reversing agents (LRAs) such as prostratin and similar to bryostatin. PKC/MEK activation is required for the transcriptional activity, and thus, anti-latency activity of 4-dPE A. However, CD4, CXCR4 and CCR5 receptors down-regulation effect seems to be independent of PCK/MEK, suggesting the existence of at least two different targets for 4-dPE A. Furthermore, NF-b transcription factor is involved in 4-dPE HIV reactivation, as previously shown for other PKCs agonists. We also studied the effects of 4-dPE A in combination with other LRAs. When 4-dPE A was combined with another PKC agonists such as prostratin an antagonic effect was achieved, while, when combined with an HDAC inhibitor such as vorinostat, a strong synergistic effect was obtained. Interestingly, the latency reversing effect of the combination was synergistically diminishing the EC50 value but also increasing the efficacy showed by the drugs alone. In addition, combinations of 4-dPE A with antiretroviral drugs as CCR5 antagonist, NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs, showed a consistent synergistic effect, suggesting that the combination would not interefer with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Finally, 4-dPE A induced latent HIV reactivation in CD4 + T cells of infected patients under ART at similar levels than the tumorigenic phorbol derivative PMA, showing a clear reactivation effect. In summary, we describe here the mechanism of action of a new potent deoxyphorbol derivative as a latency reversing agent candidate to decrease the size of HIV reservoirs.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006295220301659;8.4;6.2;7.5;00062952;S0006295220301659;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006295220301659;;

All rights reserved.During sexual transmission, the high genetic diversity of HIV-1 within an individual is frequently reduced to one founder variant that initiates infection. Understanding the drivers of this bottleneck is crucial to developing effective infection control strategies. Little is known about the importance of the source partner during this bottleneck. To test the hypothesis that the source partner affects the number of HIV founder variants, we developed a phylodynamic model calibrated using genetic and epidemiological data on all existing transmission pairs for whom the direction of transmission and the infection stage of the source partner are known. Our results suggest that acquiring infection from someone in the acute (early) stage of infection increases the risk of multiple-founder variant transmission compared with acquiring infection from someone in the chronic (later) stage of infection. This study provides the first direct test of source partner characteristics to explain the low frequency of multiple-founder strain infections.;https://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aba5443;49.4;47.1;45.3;00368075;;;;

In an era with 2-drug regimens for antiretroviral therapy, transmitted resistance for INSTI is alarming. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 28-year-old African American female was recently diagnosed with HIV during a 30-week prenatal visit. DIAGNOSIS: HIV 4th generation test was positive as well as confirmation. Genotype was performed using next generation sequencing. INTERVENTIONS: Patient was initially rapidly started on a dolutegravir based regimen and changed to a protease inhibitor regimen once her genotype reported an S230R mutation. OUTCOMES: Patient became virally suppressed on antiretroviral therapy and delivered an HIV negative baby. LESSONS: INSTI resistance testing should be done for treatment-naïve and INSTI-naïve persons, particularly when considering 2 drug INSTI based regimens.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/MD.0000000000020915;2.1;2.7;2.7;;;;;

Several studies showed that CDKN1A/p21 is expressed at high levels ex vivo in cells from individuals who naturally control HIV-1 replication (HIC) and a recent study supports a coordinate regulation of ZC3H12A/MCPIP1 and CDKN1A/p21 transcripts in a model of renal carcinoma cells. Here, we explored the potential associations between mRNA expression of ZC3H12A/MCPIP1 and CDKN1A/p21 in HIC sustaining undetectable (elite controllers-EC) or low (viremic controllers-VC) viral loads. Results: We found a selective upregulation of ZC3H12A/MCPIP1 and CDKN1A/p21 mRNA levels in PBMC from HIC compared with both ART-suppressed and HIV-negative control groups (P 0.02) and higher MCPIP1 and p21 proteins levels in HIC than in HIV-1 negative subjects. There was a moderate positive correlation (r  0.57; P  0.014) between expressions of both transcripts in HIC and in HIC combined with control groups. We found positive correlations between the mRNA level of CDKN1A/p21 with activated CD4+ T cells levels in HIC (r  0.53; P  0.017) and between the mRNA levels of both CDKN1A/p21 (r = 0.74; P = 0.005) and ZC3H12A/MCPIP1 (r = 0.58; P = 0.040) with plasmatic levels of sCD14 in EC. Reanalysis of published transcriptomic data confirmed the positive association between ZC3H12A/MCPIP1 and CDKN1A/p21 mRNA levels in CD4+ T cells and monocytes from disparate cohorts of HIC and other HIV-positive control groups. Conclusions: These data show for the first time the simultaneous upregulation of ZC3H12A/MCPIP1 and CDKN1A/p21 transcripts in the setting of natural suppression of HIV-1 replication in vivo and the positive correlation of the expression of these cellular factors in disparate cohorts of HIV-positive individuals. The existence of a common regulatory pathway connecting ZC3H12A/MCPIP1 and CDKN1A/p21 could have a synergistic effect on HIV-1 replication control and pharmacological manipulation of these multifunctional host factors may open novel therapeutic perspectives to prevent HIV-1 replication and disease progression.";https://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12977-020-00522-4;7.3;6.7;6.7;;;;;

The molecular mechanisms by which MARCH8 targets envelope glycoproteins remain unknown. Here, we show two different mechanisms by which MARCH8 inhibits viral infection. Viruses pseudotyped with the VSV-G mutant, in which cytoplasmic lysine residues were mutated, were insensitive to the inhibitory effect of MARCH8, whereas those with a similar lysine mutant of HIV-1 Env remained sensitive to it. Indeed, the wild-type VSV-G, but not its lysine mutant, was ubiquitinated by MARCH8. Furthermore, the MARCH8 mutant, which had a disrupted cytoplasmic tyrosine motif that is critical for intracellular protein sorting, did not inhibit HIV-1 Env-mediated infection, while it still impaired infection by VSV-G-pseudotyped viruses. Overall, we conclude that MARCH8 reduces viral infectivity by downregulating envelope glycoproteins through two different mechanisms mediated by a ubiquitination-dependent or tyrosine motif-dependent pathway.;https://elifesciences.org/articles/57763;10.0;10.8;10.8;;;;;

Published by BMJ.Introduction At least 30% of people living with HIV (PLWH) infection have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which has now become a leading cause of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. Management is based largely on lifestyle modifications, which are difficult to achieve, and therapeutic options are urgently needed. Maraviroc (MVC), through antagonism of CCR5 receptors, may reduce hepatic fibrosis progression and could be an effective treatment for NAFLD. However, dosing is usually two times per day, unlike most currently recommended antiretroviral therapies. This study will investigate the feasibility and acceptability of addition of MVC to combination antiretroviral therapy in PLWH and NAFLD as a treatment for NAFLD. Methods and analysis This is a phase IV, randomised, open-label, non-invasive feasibility study. Sixty individuals with well-controlled HIV-1 and NAFLD will be recruited from UK HIV clinics and randomised 1:1 to receive either optimised background therapy (OBT) plus MVC or OBT alone. Follow-up will be every 24 weeks for 96 weeks. The primary outcome measures will include recruitment and retention rates, adverse events and adherence. Secondary outcomes will include changes in markers of hepatic fibrosis, including the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis score, median liver stiffness measurement and controlled attenuation parameter scores on Fibroscan, and quality of life assessments. Analyses will be performed according to intention-to-treat principles. For secondary outcomes, estimated differences and 95% CIs between the groups using a t-method will be presented for continuous variables and as exact 95% binomial CIs for categorical variables. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained through the London Dulwich UK Research Ethics Committee (reference 17/LO/2093). Results will be disseminated both through community groups and peer-reviewed scientific literature. Trial registration number SRCTN31461655.

All rights reserved.HIV-1 latency is a major barrier to cure. Identification of small molecules that destabilize latency and allow immune clearance of infected cells could lead to treatment-free remission. In vitro models of HIV-1 latency involving cell lines or primary cells have been developed for characterization of HIV-1 latency and high-throughput screening for latency-reversing agents (LRAs). We have shown that the majority of LRAs identified to date are relatively ineffective in cells from infected individuals despite activity in model systems. We show here that, for diverse LRAs, latency reversal observed in model systems involves a heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)-mediated stress pathway. Small-molecule inhibition of HSF1 attenuated HIV-1 latency reversal by histone deactylase inhibitors, protein kinase C agonists, and proteasome inhibitors without interfering with the known mechanism of action of these LRAs. However, latency reversal by second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC) mimetics was not affected by inhibition of HSF1. In cells from infected individuals, inhibition of HSF1 attenuated latency reversal by phorbol ester+ionomycin but not by anti-CD3+anti-CD28. HSF1 promotes elongation of HIV-1 RNA by recruiting P-TEFb to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), and we show that inhibition of HSF1 attenuates the formation of elongated HIV-1 transcripts. We demonstrate that in vitro models of latency have higher levels of the P-TEFb subunit cyclin T1 than primary cells, which may explain why many LRAs are functional in model systems but relatively ineffective in primary cells. Together, these studies provide insights into why particular LRA combinations are effective in reversing latency in cells from infected individuals.;http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1916290117;17.1;16.1;15.7;00278424;;;;

Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.BACKGROUND: Cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a World Health Organization-recommended standard of care in resource-limited settings, but the mechanism of CPT's beneficial effects is unclear. The COSTOP trial (ISRCTN44723643) evaluated the noninferiority of discontinuing CPT in stabilized patients on antiretroviral therapy. The COSTOP immunology substudy was conducted on a subset of COSTOP participants randomized to continue CPT (n = 86) or discontinue CPT (placebo, n = 86) as daily treatment for 1 year. METHODS: We evaluated whether CPT reduces microbial translocation, indicated by the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS control factors such as soluble CD14 (sCD14) and endotoxin core antibody (EndoCAb immunoglobulin M [IgM]) in plasma. Intestinal barrier damage as indicated by plasma intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP), T-cell activation, and the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-) were also evaluated. RESULTS: We found no significant change in markers of microbial translocation (LPS, IFABP, sCD14, and T-cell activation), with decreased EndoCAb IgM. There was significant increase in inflammation markers (CRP and IL-6) after stopping CPT compared to those who continued CPT. CONCLUSIONS: These results add to the evidence of immunological benefits of CPT among HIV-infected populations in resource-limited settings. However, no evidence of reducing microbial translocation was observed.;https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/222/3/381/5623996;10.4;9.2;9.0;;;;;

Phylogenetic and recombination analyses showed a predominance of CRF02_AG strains (165/248; 66.5%) and a high genetic diversity with five other variants and 39 URFs (15.7%) which contained portions of strains that co-circulate in Benin. Eight recent transmission chains revealed active ongoing transmission of HIV-1 strains among ARV-naïve patients. Our study showed a moderate primary drug resistance mutations rate and also provided recent data on the HIV-1 variants that circulate in Benin.

Here, we study and compare the efficiency of Jarzynski's equality (JE) combined with steered molecular dynamics and the linear interaction energy (LIE) method by assessing the binding affinity of 23 small compounds to six receptors, including -lactamase, thrombin, factor Xa, HIV-1 protease (HIV), myeloid cell leukemia-1, and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 proteins. It was shown that Jarzynski's nonequilibrium binding free energy GneqJar correlates with the available experimental data with the correlation levels R = 0.89, 0.86, 0.83, 0.80, 0.83, and 0.81 for six data sets, while for the binding free energy GLIE obtained by the LIE method, we have R = 0.73, 0.80, 0.42, 0.23, 0.85, and 0.01. Therefore, JE is recommended to be used for ranking binding affinities as it provides accurate and robust results. In contrast, LIE is not as reliable as JE, and it should be used with caution, especially when it comes to new systems.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c02009;6.0;5.8;5.2;15206106;;;;

In this article, a mathematical model has been derived to study the effect of enfuvirtide in combination with protease inhibitors in HIV treatment. The dynamics of the two drugs have been analysed with a double impulsive control approach. We have considered different impulse interval for each drug and determine the threshold value for the dosages and dosing intervals to ensure the stability of disease free equilibrium. This study suggests that FIs-and-PIs combination therapy can have a better outcome than single drug activity; furthermore it can also be a better treatment strategy than the current combination of drugs when applied with proper dose and dosing intervals.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40819-020-00861-y;0;0.3;1.9;23495103;;;;

This article is available under a Creative Commons License (Attribution 4.0 International, as described at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).Antiretroviral therapy suppresses but does not cure HIV-1 infection due to the existence of a long-lived reservoir of latently infected cells. The reservoir has an estimated half-life of 44 mo and is largely composed of clones of infected CD4+ T cells. The long half-life appears to result in part from expansion and contraction of infected CD4+ T cell clones. However, the mechanisms that govern this process are poorly understood. To determine whether the clones might result from and be maintained by exposure to antigen, we measured responses of reservoir cells to a small subset of antigens from viruses that produce chronic or recurrent infections. Despite the limited panel of test antigens, clones of antigen-responsive CD4+ T cells containing defective or intact latent proviruses were found in seven of eight individuals studied. Thus, chronic or repeated exposure to antigen may contribute to the longevity of the HIV-1 reservoir by stimulating the clonal expansion of latently infected CD4+ T cells.;https://rupress.org/jem/article/doi/10.1084/jem.20200051/151689/Antigenresponsive-CD4-T-cell-clones-contribute-to;18.2;17.5;18.2;00221007;;;;

TRIM5 targets the HIV capsid for proteosomal destruction. Cyclophilin A, an intracellular protein has also been reported to influence HIV infectivity in a cell-specific manner. Accordingly, variations in TRIM5 and Cyclophilin A genes have been documented to influence HIV-1 disease progression. However, these variations have not been documented among Elite controllers in Uganda and whether they play a role in viral suppression remains largely undocumented. Our study focused on identifying the variations in TRIM5 and Cyclophilin A genes among HIV-1 Elite controllers and non-controllers in Uganda. Results: From the sequence analysis, the rs10838525 G > A mutation in exon 2 of TRIM5 was only found among elite controllers (30%) while the rs3824949 in the 5UTR was seen among 25% of the non-controllers. In the Cyclophilin A promoter, rs6850 was seen among 62.5% of the non-controllers and only among 10% elite controllers. Furthermore, rs17860048 in the Cyclophillin A promoter was predominantly seen among elite controllers (30%) and 12.5% non-controllers. From gene expression analysis, we noted that the respective genes were generally elevated among elite controllers, however, this difference was not statistically significant (TRIM5 p = 0.6095; Cyclophilin A p = 0.6389). Conclusion: Variations in TRIM5 and Cyclophillin A promoter may influence HIV viral suppression. The rs10838525 SNP in TRIM5 may contribute to viral suppression among HIV-1 elite controllers. The rs6850 in the cyclophillin A gene may be responsible for HIV-1 rapid progression among HIV-1 non-controllers. These SNPs should be investigated mechanistically to determine their precise role in HIV-1 viral suppression.";https://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12977-020-00527-z;7.3;6.7;6.7;;;;;

This gives the illusion that it is possible to analyze minor variants in a viral population. However, including a PCR step obscures the sampling depth of the viral population, the key parameter needed to understand the utility of the data set for finding minor variants. Also, these high throughput sequencing platforms are error prone at the level where minor variants are of interest, confounding the interpretation of detected minor variants. A simple strategy has been applied in multiple applications of NGS to solve these problems. Prior to PCR, individual molecules are “tagged” with a unique molecular identifier (UMI) that can be used to establish the actual sample size of viral genomes sequenced after PCR and sequencing. In addition, since PCR generates many copies of each sequence tagged to a specific UMI, a template consensus sequence (TCS) can be created from the many reads of each template, removing virtually all of the method error. From this perspective we examine our own use of a UMI, called Primer ID, in the detection of minor drug resistant variants in HIV-1 populations.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/8/850;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

Furthermore, prevalent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and hepatitis B (HBV) co-infections highlight an immediate need for dual long-acting and easily administered antivirals. To this end, we modified lamivudine (3TC), a nucleoside analog inhibitor of both viruses, into a lipophilic monophosphorylated prodrug (M23TC). Prior work demonstrated that nanoformulation of M23TC (NM23TC) enhanced drug stability, controlled dissolution and improved access to sites of viral replication. The present study evaluated the efficacy of a NM23TC in HBV-infected chimeric liver humanized mice. Levels of HBV DNA and HBsAg in plasma were monitored up to 8 weeks posttreatment. A single intramuscular dose of 75 mg/kg 3TC equivalents of nanoformulated NM23TC provided sustained drug levels and suppressed HBV replication in humanized mice for 4 weeks. The results support further development of this long-acting 3TC nanoformulation for HBV treatment and prevention.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S154996342030037X;10.5;10.8;10.3;15499634;S154996342030037X;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S154996342030037X;;

NNRTIs continue to be used as first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in some communities due to the cost of dolutegravir-based ART or dolutegravir-associated adverse events. A simplified version of the oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA) - 'OLA-Simple' - is a low-cost, near point-of-care assay that provides ready-to-use lyophilized reagents and reports HIVDR mutations as colored lines on lateral flow strips. Our objective was to design and validate OLA-Simple for a Mexican cohort. DESIGN: OLA-Simple probes to detect K65R, K103N/S, Y181C, M184V, and G190A were optimized for HIV Mexican sequences. Sixty clinical plasma specimens were analyzed by OLA-Simple by technicians blinded to Illumina-MiSeq sequences, and HIVDR results were compared. METHODS: Plasma RNA was tested using OLA-Simple kits. OLA-Simple lateral flow strips were read by in-house software, and were classified as mutant or wild-type at each codon. The comparison of results by OLA-Simple and Miseq was used to generate receiver-operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: OLA-Simple PCR amplified 59 of 60 specimens and successfully genotyped 287 of 295 codons, with eight of 295 (2.7%) indeterminate results. Compared to MiSeq, OLA-Simple gave five of 295 (1.7%) false-positive and four of 295 (1.4%) false-negative results. Excluding indeterminate results, OLA-Simple classified mutant with an accuracy of 97.4 and 98.8% when using thresholds at 10 and 25% mutant within an individual's HIV quasispecies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to MiSeq, OLA-Simple detected HIVDR with high sensitivity and accuracy.

People with homozygous CCR532 deletion resist HIV-1 infection, which makes the CCR5 an important target for HIV-1 gene therapy. Although the CRISPR/Cas9 has ever been used for HIV-1 study, the newly developed CRISPR/AsCpf1 has never been utilized in HIV-1 co-receptor disruption. The CRISPR/Cpf1 system shows many advantages over CRISPR/Cas9, such as lower off-target, small size of nuclease, easy sgRNA design for multiplex gene editing, etc. Therefore, the CRISPR/Cpf1 mediated gene editing will confer a more specific and safe strategy in HIV-1 co-receptor disruption. Results: Here, we demonstrated that CRISPR/AsCpf1 could ablate the main co-receptor of HIV-1 infection-CCR5 efficiently with two screened sgRNAs via different delivery strategies (lentivirus, adenovirus). The edited cells resisted R5-tropic HIV-1 infection but not X4-tropic HIV-1 infection compared with the control group in different cell types of HIV-1 study (TZM.bl, SupT1-R5, Primary CD4+T cells). Meanwhile, the edited cells exhibited selective advantage over unedited cells while under the pressure of R5-tropic HIV-1. Furthermore, we clarified that the predicted off-target sites of selected sgRNAs were very limited, which is much less than regular using sgRNAs for CRISPR/Cas9, and no evident off-target was observed. We also showed that the disruption of CCR5 by CRISPR/AsCpf1 took no effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Conclusions: Our study provides a basis for a possible application of CCR5-targeting gene editing by CRISPR/AsCpf1 with high specific sgRNAs against HIV-1 infection.;https://cellandbioscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13578-020-00444-w;5.6;5.6;5.5;;;;;

The BILHIV (bilharzia and HIV) study assessed the performance of home-based self-collection methods (cervical and vaginal swabs) compared to cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) for the detection of Schistosoma DNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Methods Between January and August 2018, a consecutive series of female participants from the Population-Cohort of the previous HIV prevention trial HPTN 071 (PopART), resident in Livingstone, Zambia were invited to take part in BILHIV if they were 18–31 years old, non-pregnant and sexually active. Genital self-collected swabs and a urine specimen were obtained and a questionnaire completed at home visits. CVL was obtained at clinic follow-up. Results 603 women self-collected genital swabs. Of these, 527 women had CVL performed by a mid-wife during clinic follow-up. Schistosoma DNA was more frequently detected in genital self-collected specimens (24/603, 4.0%) compared to CVL (14/527, 2.7%). Overall, 5.0% (30/603) women had female genital schistosomiasis, defined as a positive PCR by any genital sampling method (cervical swab PCR, vaginal swab PCR, or CVL PCR) and 95% (573/ 603) did not have a positive genital PCR. The sensitivity of any positive genital self-collected swab against CVL was 57.1% (95% CI 28.9–82.3%), specificity 97.3% (95.5–98.5%). In a subset of participants with active schistosome infection, determined by detectable urine Circulating Anodic Antigen (CAA) (15.1%, 91/601), positive PCR (4.3%, 26/601), or positive microscopy (5.5%, 33/603), the sensitivity of any positive self-collected specimen against CVL was 88.9% (51.8–99.7%). Conclusions Genital self-sampling increased the overall number of PCR-based FGS diagnoses in a field setting, compared with CVL. Home-based sampling may represent a scalable alternative method for FGS community-based diagnosis in endemic resource limited settings.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008337;7.1;7.4;7.6;19352727;;;;

Activation of the provirus using latency-reversing agents (LRAs) followed by immune-mediated clearance to purge reservoirs has been touted as a promising therapeutic approach. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyltransferases (HATs) control the acetylation level of lysine residues in histones to regulate the gene transcription. Several clinical HDAC inhibitors had been examined as LRAs, which induced HIV activation in vitro and in vivo. Here we report the discovery of a series of selective and potent class I HDAC inhibitors based on aryl ketones as a zinc binding group, which reversed HIV latency using a Jurkat model of HIV latency in 2C4 cells. The SAR led to the discovery of a highly selective class I HDAC inhibitor 10 with excellent potency. HDACi 10 induces the HIV gag P24 protein in patient latent CD4+ T cells.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsmedchemlett.0c00302;6.4;6.3;6.0;;;;;

HVTN 098, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of PENNVAX-GP HIV DNA vaccine, administered with or without plasmid IL-12 (pIL-12), via intradermal (ID) or intramuscular (IM) electroporation (EP) in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. The study tested whether PENNVAX-GP delivered via ID/EP at one-fifth the dose could elicit equivalent immune responses to delivery via IM/EP and whether inclusion of pIL-12 provided additional benefit. METHODS. Participants received DNA encoding HIV-1 env/gag/pol in 3 groups: 1.6 mg ID (ID no IL-1 group, n = 20), 1.6 mg ID + 0.4 mg pIL-12 (ID + IL-12 group, n = 30), 8 mg IM + 1 mg pIL-12 (IM + IL-12 group, n = 30), or placebo (n = 9) via EP at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months. Results of cellular and humoral immunogenicity assessments are reported. RESULTS. Following vaccination, the frequency of responders (response rate) to any HIV protein based on CD4+ T cells expressing IFN- or IL-2 was 96% for both the ID + IL-12 and IM + IL-12 groups CD8+ T cell response rates were 64% and 44%, respectively. For ID delivery, the inclusion of pIL-12 increased CD4+ T cell response rate from 56% to 96%. The frequency of responders was similar (90%) for IgG binding antibody to gp140 consensus Env across all groups, but the magnitude was higher in the ID + IL-12 group compared with the IM + IL-12 group. CONCLUSION. PENNVAX-GP DNA induced robust cellular and humoral immune responses, demonstrating that immunogenicity of DNA vaccines can be enhanced by EP route and inclusion o pIL-12. ID/EP was dose sparing, inducing equivalent, or in some aspects superior, immune respons compared with IM/EP.;https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/137079;0;2.6;5.8;;;;;

To determine whether these genes play a role in HIV-1 pathogenesis, we analysed whether naturally occurring genetic variations were associated with the clinical course of infection. DESIGN/METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ALCAM and TPST2 were analysed in a cohort of 304 HIV-1-infected men who have sex with men and survival analysis was used to determine their effect on the outcome of untreated HIV-1 infection. Flowcytometry was used to determine the effect of SNPs on CD4 T-cell activation prior to HIV-1 infection and 1 and 5 years after infection. In-vitro HIV-1 infections were performed to analyse the effect of the SNPs on HIV-1 replication. RESULTS: We observed that the minor allele of rs1344861 in ALCAM was associated with accelerated disease progression, whereas the minor allele of rs9613199 in TPST2 was associated with delayed disease progression. In-vitro infection assays did not demonstrate any differences in HIV-1 replication associated with rs9613199. However, the increase in CD4 T-cell immune activation levels during HIV-1 infection was less pronounced in infected individuals homozygous for rs9613199, which is in agreement with delayed disease progression. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that ALCAM and TPST2 play a role in HIV-1 pathogenesis. SNPs in these genes, without known functional implications, had a major effect on disease progression, and therefore, these HDFs may be attractive and effective targets for new treatment strategies.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAD.0000000000002540;8.8;7.1;7.5;;;;;

RNA has therefore become an important target for developing novel therapeutic approaches. The biophysical processes underlying RNA function are often associated with rare structural transitions that play a key role in ligand recognition. In this work, we probe these rarely occurring transitions using nonequilibrium simulations by characterizing the dissociation of a ligand molecule from an HIV-1 viral RNA element. Specifically, we observed base-flipping rare events that are coupled with ligand binding/unbinding and also provided mechanistic details underlying these transitions.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c01390;14.3;13.0;11.2;;;;;

The objective of this study was to identify phenotypic and transcriptional changes in blood monocytes and CD4 T cells in HIV-1-infected and uninfected individuals and elucidate processes associated with neurocognitive impairment. DESIGN: A group of chronically HIV-1-infected Thai individuals (n = 19) were selected for comparison with healthy donor controls (n = 10). Infected participants were further classified as cognitively normal (n = 10) or with HAND (n = 9). Peripheral monocytes and CD4 T cells were phenotyped by flow cytometry and simultaneously isolated for multiplex qPCR-targeted gene expression profiling directly ex vivo. The frequency of HIV-1 RNA-positive cells was estimated by limiting dilution cell sorting. RESULTS: Expression of genes and proteins involved in cellular activation and proinflammatory immune responses was increased in monocytes and CD4 T cells from HIV-1-infected relative to uninfected individuals. Gene expression profiles of both CD4 T cells and monocytes correlated with soluble markers of inflammation in the periphery (P < 0.05). By contrast, only modest differences in gene programs were observed between cognitively normal and HAND cases. These included increased monocyte surface CD169 protein expression relative to cognitively normal (P = 0.10), decreased surface CD163 expression relative to uninfected (P = 0.02) and cognitively normal (P = 0.06), and downregulation of EMR2 (P = 0.04) and STAT1 (P = 0.02) relative to cognitively normal. CONCLUSION: Our data support a model of highly activated monocytes and CD4 T cells associated with inflammation in chronic HIV-1 infection, but impaired monocyte anti-inflammatory responses in HAND compared with cognitively normal.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAD.0000000000002537;8.8;7.1;7.5;;;;;

It remains elusive whether viral factors including Nef-mediated immune evasion function diminish protective allele effect on viral control. DESIGN: The naturally occurring non-Ser variant at position 9 of HIV-1 subtype C Nef has recently exhibited an association with enhanced HLA-B downregulation function and decreased susceptibility to recognition by CD8 T cells. We therefore hypothesized this Nef genotype leads to diminished immune control mediated by protective HLA alleles. METHODS: Nef sequences were isolated from HIV-1 subtype C-infected patients harboring protective alleles and several Nef functions including downregulation of HLA-A, HLA-B, CD4, and SERINC5 were examined. Association between Nef non-Ser9 and plasma viral load was examined in two independent South African and Botswanan treatment-naïve cohorts. RESULTS: Nef clones isolated from protective allele individuals encoding Nef non-Ser9 variant exhibited greater ability to downregulate HLA-B when compared with the Ser9 variant, while other Nef functions including HLA-A, CD4, and SERINC5 downregulation activity were unaltered. By analyzing a cohort of South African participants chronically infected with subtype C HIV-1, Nef non-Ser9 associated with higher plasma viral load in patients harboring protective alleles. Corroboratively, the Nef non-Ser9 correlated with higher plasma viral load in an independent cohort in Botswana.

Here, a new approach that combines the adaptive steered molecular dynamics (ASMD) and partial atomic charges calculated by semi-empirical quantum mechanics (SQMPC), namely ASMD-SQMPC, is suggested to predict the ligand binding affinities, with 24 HIV-1 protease inhibitors as testing examples. In the ASMD-SQMPC, the relative binding free energy (G) is reflected by the average maximum potential of mean force (<PMF>max) between bound and unbound states. The correlation coefficient (R2) between the <PMF>max and experimentally determined G is 0.86, showing a significant improvement compared with the conventional ASMD (R2 = 0.52). Therefore, this study provides an efficient approach to predict the relative G and reveals the significance of precise partial atomic charges in the theoretical simulations.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.26218;5.8;5.8;5.9;01928651;;;;

Although suboptimal levels of access and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) are common among HIV-positive PWUD, there is a need for studies investigating the possible biological impacts of noninjection illicit drug use among people living with HIV in real-world settings. METHODS: We accessed data from the ACCESS study, an ongoing prospective cohort of illicit drug users with systematic HIV viral load monitoring in a setting with universal care and ART dispensation records. We used multivariable generalized linear mixed models to estimate the longitudinal associations between noninjection use of crack cocaine, powder cocaine, opioids, methamphetamine, cannabis and alcohol on plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load, adjusted for ART exposure and relevant confounders. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2018, 843 individuals from the ACCESS cohort were included and contributed to 8698 interviews. At baseline, the mean age was 43 years, 566 (67%) reported male sex and 659 (78%) used crack cocaine in the previous 6 months. In multivariable models adjusted for ART exposure, only crack cocaine use in the last 6 months was found to be significantly associated with higher HIV viral load. CONCLUSION: We observed significantly higher HIV viral load during periods of crack cocaine use independent of ART exposure. Our findings support further research to investigate the possible biological mechanisms of this effect.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAD.0000000000002551;8.8;7.1;7.5;;;;;

It has pathological roles in HIV-1, WHIM disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. An antagonist, AMD3100, is used for the release of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow for autologous transplantation for lymphoma or multiple myeloma patients. Adverse effects are tolerated due to its short-term treatment, but AMD3100 is cardiotoxic in clinical studies for HIV-1. In an effort to determine whether Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing a functional human CXCR4 could be used as a platform for identifying a ligand from a library of less 1,000 compounds, a high-throughput screening was developed. We report that 2-carboxyphenyl phosphate (fosfosal) up-regulates CXCR4 activation only in the presence of CXCL12. This is the first identification of a compound that increases CXCR4 activity by any mechanism. We mapped the fosfosal binding site on CXCL12, described its mechanism of action, and studied its chemical components, salicylate and phosphate, to conclude that they synergize to achieve the functional effect.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmolb.2020.00164/full;4.2;5.4;5.1;;;;;

We aimed to characterize the APRIL levels in subjects with different HIV-1 infection statuses and determine the relationships with disease progression and immune activation. Methods: The plasma levels of APRIL were compared among 17 long-term non-progressors (LTNPs), 17 typical progressors (TPs), 10 ART-treated patients, and 10 healthy donors (HDs). Seventeen LTNPs and a subset of TPs (n = 6) who initiated ART were assessed longitudinally. The correlations between the APRIL levels and markers of disease progression, B-cell count and specific antibody response, and markers of immune activation and functional cells were analyzed. Results: The circulating APRIL levels were significantly elevated in the LTNPs relative to the TPs, ART-treated patients, and HDs. The longitudinal investigation revealed that the APRIL levels were decreased during follow-up in the LTNPs. ART did not significantly influence the APRIL levels. The levels of plasma APRIL were negatively correlated with the plasma HIV-1 viral load and cellular HIV-1 DNA levels and positively correlated with the CD4+ T-cell count and CD4/CD8 ratio. An inverse correlation was observed between the APRIL and BAFF levels. Furthermore, the APRIL levels were negatively correlated with the frequency of activated CD8+ T cells and levels of interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Finally, positive correlations were observed among the APRIL levels, the frequency of CD8+CD28+ T cells, and natural killer (NK) cell count. Conclusion: The APRIL levels were elevated in the LTNPs and negatively correlated with disease progression and immune activation, suggesting likely protective activity in HIV-1 infection.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmed.2020.00299/full;0;2.7;4.3;;;;;

Since both cardiovascular and renal disease, and polypharmacy, are common in ageing people with HIV, there is a need for alternative efficacious regimens. bPI-based regimens are often the treatment of choice for individuals with pre-treatment or treatment-acquired resistance but it is plausible that carefully selected HIV-positive individuals with drug resistance, who are virologically suppressed on their current bPI regimen, could maintain virological efficacy when switched to bictegravir, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) fixed dose combination (FDC). Methods/design: A phase IV, investigator-initiated, multicentre, open label pilot, randomised two-arm study to assess the safety and efficacy of switching from bPI regimen to B/F/TAF single tablet regimen in integrase inhibitor-naïve, virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1 infection harbouring drug resistance mutations. Eligible individuals will either continue on their bPI regimen or switch to B/F/TAF FDC. After 24 weeks, all participants in the bPI arm will be switched to B/F/TAF and followed for a further 24 weeks and all participants will be followed for 48 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at week 24 using pure virologic response whilst the secondary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48. Other secondary outcome measures include between arm comparisons of drug resistance at virological failure, safety and tolerability and patient-reported outcome measures. Discussion: We aim to provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy of switching to B/F/TAF in patients with virological suppression on a bPI-based regimen who harbour select drug resistance mutations.

While the antigen-binding site of antibodies is known to mutate throughout the co-evolution of antibodies and viruses in infected individuals, the roles of the mutations in the antibody framework region are not well understood. Throughout affinity maturation, the CH103 broadly neutralizing antibody lineage, from an individual designated CH505, altered the orientation of one of its antibody variable domains. The change in orientation was a response to insertions in the variable loop 5 (V5) of the HIV envelope. In this study, we generated CH103 lineage antibody variants in which residues in the variable domain interface were mutated, and measured the binding to both autologous and heterologous HIV-1 envelopes. Our data show that very few mutations in an early intermediate antibody of the lineage can improve binding toward both autologous and heterologous HIV-1 envelopes. We also crystallized an antibody mutant to show that framework mutations alone can result in a shift in relative orientations of the variable domains. Taken together, our results demonstrate the functional importance of residues located outside the antigen-binding site in affinity maturation.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01529/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;;;;

Acute infection and the early start of ART provide unique settings to address the impact of HIV on the B cell compartment. We took advantage of a cohort of 21 seroconverters, grouped according to the presence of severe manifestations likely mediated by antibodies or immune complexes, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, with a follow-up of 8 weeks upon effective ART. We combined B and T cell phenotyping with serum immunoglobulin level measurement and quantification of sj-KRECs and B to estimate bone marrow output and peripheral proliferative history of B cells, respectively. We observed marked B cell disturbances, notably a significant expansion of cells expressing low levels of CD21, in parallel with markers of both impaired bone marrow output and increased peripheral B cell proliferation. This B cell dysregulation is likely to contribute to the severe immune-mediated conditions, as attested by the higher serum IgG and the reduced levels of sj-KRECs with increased B in these individuals as compared to those patients with mild disease. Nevertheless, upon starting ART, the dynamic of B cell recovery was not distinct in the two groups, featuring both persistent alterations by week 8. Overall, we showed for the first time that acute HIV-1 infection is associated with decreased bone marrow B cell output assessed by sj-KRECs. Our study emphasizes the need to intervene in both bone marrow and peripheral responses to facilitate B cell recovery during acute HIV-1 infection.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fcimb.2020.00347/full;4.2;3.8;5.4;;;;;

To further identify the determinants governing the intracellular trafficking of Gag-gRNA complexes and their accumulation at the PM, we compared, in living and fixed cells, the interactions between gRNA and wild-type Gag or Gag mutants carrying deletions in NC zinc fingers (ZFs) or a nonmyristoylated version of Gag. Our data showed that the deletion of both ZFs simultaneously or the complete NC domain completely abolished intracytoplasmic Gag-gRNA interactions. Deletion of either ZF delayed the delivery of gRNA to the PM but did not prevent Gag-gRNA interactions in the cytoplasm, indicating that the two ZFs display redundant roles in this respect. However, ZF2 played a more prominent role than ZF1 in the accumulation of the ribonucleoprotein complexes at the PM. Finally, the myristate group, which is mandatory for anchoring the complexes at the PM, was found to be dispensable for the association of Gag with the gRNA in the cytosol.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006349520304768;6.3;6.2;6.2;00063495;S0006349520304768;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006349520304768;;

Release from peripheral tolerance restraint can occur under certain circumstances (i.e., strong TLR stimulus), that are present during infection. In this regard, we hypothesized that autoreactive B cells could function as a reserve population that can be activated to contribute to the humoral immune response, particularly with pathogens, such as HIV-1, that exploit immune tolerance to avoid host defense. In this study, we identify a population of autoreactive B cells with the potential to neutralize HIV-1 and experimentally release them from the functional restrictions of peripheral tolerance. We have previously identified murine monoclonal antibodies that displayed autoreactivity against histone H2A and neutralized HIV-1 in vitro. Here, we identify additional H2A-reactive IgM monoclonal antibodies and demonstrate that they are both autoreactive and polyreactive with self and foreign antigens and are able to neutralize multiple clades of tier 2 HIV-1. Flow cytometric analysis of H2A-reactive B cells in naïve wildtype mice revealed that these B cells are present in peripheral B cell populations and we further document that murine H2A-reactive B cells are restrained by peripheral tolerance mechanisms. Specifically, we show endogenous H2A-reactive B cells display increased expression of the inhibitory mediators CD5 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) phosphatase and fail to mobilize calcium upon immunoreceptor stimulation; all characterized markers of anergy. Moreover, we show that toll-like receptor stimulation or provision of CD4 T cell help induces the in vitro production of H2A-reactive antibodies, breaking tolerance. Thus, we have identified a novel poly/autoreactive B cell population that has the potential to neutralize HIV-1 but is silenced by immune tolerance.";https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01565/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;;;;

We have recently found several benzotriazole and benzotriazine analogues that have the ability to reactivate latent HIV by inhibiting signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) SUMOylation and promoting STAT5 binding to the HIV long terminal repeat and increasing its transcriptional activity. To understand the essential structural groups required for biological activity of these molecules, we performed a systematic analysis of >40 analogues. First, we characterized the essential motifs within these molecules that are required for their biological activity. Second, we identified three benzotriazine analogues with similar activity. We demonstrated that these three compounds are able to increase STAT5 phosphorylation and transcriptional activity. All active analogues reactivate latent HIV in a primary cell model of latency and enhance the ability of interleukin-15 to reactivate latent HIV in cells isolated from aviremic participants. Third, this family of compounds also promote immune effector functions in vitro in the absence of toxicity or global immune activation. Finally, initial studies in mice suggest lack of acute toxicity in vivo A better understanding of the biological activity of these compounds will help in the design of improved LRAs that work via inhibition of STAT5 SUMOylation.";https://aac.asm.org/content/64/8/e00888-20;7.8;7.9;8.3;;;;;

Growing evidence demonstrates that dysregulation of AS is associated with tumorigenesis. However, an integrated analysis in identifying the AS biomarkers attributed to esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) is largely unexplored. Methods: AS percent-splice-in (PSI) data were obtained from the TCGA SpliceSeq database. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was successively performed to identify the overall survival (OS)-associated AS events, followed by the construction of AS predictor through different splicing patterns. Then, a nomogram that combines the final AS predictor and clinicopathological characteristics was established. Finally, a splicing regulatory network was created according to the correlation between the AS events and the splicing factors (SF). Results: We identified a total of 2389 AS events with the potential to be used as prognostic markers that are associated with the OS of ESCA patients. Based on splicing patterns, we then built eight AS predictors that are highly capable in distinguishing high- and low-risk patients, and in predicting ESCA prognosis. Notably, the area under curve (AUC) value for the exon skip (ES) prognostic predictor was shown to reach a score of 0.885, indicating that ES has the highest prediction strength in predicting ESCA prognosis. In addition, a nomogram that comprises the pathological stage and risk group was shown to be highly efficient in predicting the survival possibility of ESCA patients. Lastly, the splicing correlation network analysis revealed the opposite roles of splicing factors (SFs) in ESCA. Conclusion: In this study, the AS events may provide reliable biomarkers for the prognosis of ESCA. The splicing correlation networks could provide new insights in the identification of potential regulatory mechanisms during the ESCA development.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fgene.2020.00796/full;8.0;5.6;2.7;;;;;

All rights reserved.The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the ensuing explosive epidemic of COVID-19 disease has generated a need for assays to rapidly and conveniently measure the antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Here, we describe a collection of approaches based on SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped, single-cycle, replication-defective human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), as well as a replication-competent VSV/SARS-CoV-2 chimeric virus. While each surrogate virus exhibited subtle differences in the sensitivity with which neutralizing activity was detected, the neutralizing activity of both convalescent plasma and human monoclonal antibodies measured using each virus correlated quantitatively with neutralizing activity measured using an authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. The assays described herein are adaptable to high throughput and are useful tools in the evaluation of serologic immunity conferred by vaccination or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the potency of convalescent plasma or human monoclonal antibodies.;https://rupress.org/jem/article/doi/10.1084/jem.20201181/151961/Measuring-SARSCoV2-neutralizing-antibody-activity;18.2;17.5;18.2;00221007;;;;

PrEP could fill an important HIV prevention gap, especially for sexually active young women who are limited in their ability to negotiate mutual monogamy or condom use. As PrEP is scaled up in high HIV incidence settings, it is crucial to consider the importance of early identification of HIV infection during PrEP use, to allow for rapid discontinuation of PrEP to reduce the risk of antiretroviral (ARV) resistance. The purpose of this case study is to provide this critical evidence. Case presentation: This report describes a 20-year-old woman in a HIV sero-discordant relationship who initiated oral PrEP (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC)) through a demonstration project (CAPRISA 084) in October 2017. Despite good adherence throughout her PrEP use, she tested HIV antibody positive at month nine of study participation. Retrospective testing showed increasing HIV viral load over time, and retrospective use of fourth-generation rapid HIV tests showed HIV detection (positive antigen/antibody) at month one. Sequencing confirmed a dominant wild type at month one with dual therapy resistance patterns emerging by month three (M184V and K65R mutations), which is suggestive of protracted PrEP use during an undetected HIV infection. The participant was referred to infectious diseases for further management of her HIV infection and was initiated on a first line, tenofovir-sparing regimen. At the time of this report (January 2020), the participant had been on ARV- therapy (ART) for 13 months and had no signs of either clinical, immunologic or virologic failure. Conclusions: This case report highlights the importance of appropriate HIV screening during wider oral PrEP scale-up in high HIV incidence settings to circumvent the consequences of prolonged dual therapy in an undiagnosed HIV infection and in turn prevent ARV resistance.;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05255-5;4.5;4.3;4.1;;;;;

Antibodies against this region have been implicated in the protection against HIV acquisition in non-human primate (NHP) challenge studies and found to act synergistically with antibodies of other specificities to deliver effective Fc-mediated effector function against HIV-1-infected cells. Here, we describe the structure and function of N12-i2, an antibody isolated from an HIV-1-infected individual, and show how the unique structural features of this antibody allow for its effective Env recognition and Fc-mediated effector function. Results: N12-i2 binds within the CoRBS utilizing two adjacent sulfo-tyrosines (TYS) for binding, one of which binds to a previously unknown TYS binding pocket formed by gp120 residues of high sequence conservation among HIV-1 strains. Structural alignment with gp120 in complex with the co-receptor CCR5 indicates that the new pocket corresponds to TYS at position 15 of CCR5. In addition, structure-function analysis of N12-i2 and other CoRBS-specific antibodies indicates a link between modes of antibody binding within the CoRBS and Fc-mediated effector activities. The efficiency of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) correlated with both the level of antibody binding and the mode of antibody attachment to the epitope region, specifically with the way the Fc region was oriented relative to the target cell surface. Antibodies with poor Fc access mediated the poorest ADCC whereas those with their Fc region readily accessible for interaction with effector cells mediated the most potent ADCC. Conclusion: Our data identify a previously unknown binding site for TYS within the assembled CoRBS of the HIV-1 virus. In addition, our combined structural-modeling-functional analyses provide new insights into mechanisms of Fc-effector function of antibodies against HIV-1, in particular, how antibody binding to Env antigen affects the efficiency of ADCC response.;https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-020-00819-y;8.9;8.2;9.5;;;;;

In elite controllers and viremia controllers, viral replication is naturally controlled, with maintenance of CD4+TC levels without the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods: The aim of the present study was to describe virological and immunological risk factors among HIV-1-infected individuals according to characteristics of progression to AIDS. The sample included 30 treatment-naive patients classified into three groups based on infection duration (> 6 years), CD4+TC count and viral load: (i) 2 elite controllers (ECs), (ii) 7 viremia controllers (VCs) and (iii) 21 nonviremia controllers (NVCs). Nested PCR was employed to amplify the virus genome, which was later sequenced using the Ion PGM platform for subtyping and analysis of immune escape mutations. Results: Viral samples were classified as HIV-1 subtypes B and F. Greater selection pressure on mutations was observed in the group of viremia controllers, with a higher frequency of immunological escape mutations in the genes investigated, including two new mutations in gag. The viral sequences of viremia controllers and nonviremia controllers did not differ significantly regarding the presence of immune escape mutations. Conclusion: The results suggest that progression to AIDS is not dependent on a single variable but rather on a set of characteristics and pressures exerted by virus biology and interactions with immunogenetic host factors.;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05268-0;4.5;4.3;4.1;;;;;

Biochemical studies have identified specific sites along the viral RNA genomic template in which reverse transcriptase (RT) stalls. These stalling points, which occur after the addition of three and five template dNTPs, may serve as checkpoints to regulate the precise timing of HIV-1 reverse transcription following viral entry. Structural studies of reverse transcriptase initiation complexes (RTICs) have revealed unique conformations that may explain the slow rate of incorporation; however, questions remain about the temporal evolution of the complex and features that contribute to strong pausing during initiation. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy and single-molecule characterization of an RTIC after three rounds of dNTP incorporation (+ 3), the first major pausing point during reverse transcription initiation. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of a + 3 extended RTIC reveal conformational heterogeneity within the RTIC core. Three distinct conformations were identified, two of which adopt unique, likely off-pathway, intermediates in the canonical polymerization cycle. Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer experiments confirm that the + 3 RTIC is more structurally dynamic than earlier-stage RTICs. These alternative conformations were selectively disrupted through structure-guided point mutations to shift single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer populations back toward the on-pathway conformation. Our results support the hypothesis that conformational heterogeneity within the HIV-1 RTIC during pausing serves as an additional means of regulating HIV-1 replication.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022283620303909;8.8;8.7;9.1;00222836;S0022283620303909;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0022283620303909;;

Globally, limited data exist on TDR and SD among blood donors. In this study, drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and SD amongst HIV-1 sero-positive blood donors in Accra, Ghana were characterized. Methods: Purposive sampling method was used to collect 81 HIV sero-positive blood samples from the Southern Area Blood Center and confirmed by INNO-LIA as HIV-1 and/or HIV-2. Viral RNA was only extracted from plasma samples confirmed as HIV-1 positive. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the RNA as a template and subsequently amplified by nested PCR with specific primers. The expected products were verified, purified and sequenced. Neighbour-joining tree with the Kimura's 2-parameter distances was generated with the RT sequences using Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis version 6.0 (MEGA 6.0). Results: Out of the 81 plasma samples, 60 (74%) were confirmed as HIV-1 sero-positive by INNO-LIA HIVI/II Score kit with no HIV-2 and dual HIV-1/2 infections. The remaining samples, 21 (26%) were confirmed as HIV sero-negative. Of the 60 confirmed positive samples, (32) 53% and (28) 47% were successfully amplified in the RT and PR genes respectively. Nucleotide sequencing of amplified samples revealed the presence of major drug resistance mutations in two (2) samples; E138A in one sample and another with K65R. HIV-1 Subtypes including subtypes A, B, CRF02_AG and CRF09_cpx were found. Conclusion: This study found major drug resistance mutations, E138A and K65R in the RT gene that confer high level resistance to most NNRTIs and NRTI respectively. CRF02_AG was most predominant, the recorded percentage of subtype B and the evolutionary relationship inferred by phylogenetic analysis may suggest possible subtype importation. However, a more prospective and detailed analysis is needed to establish this phenomenon.

Cholesterol plays an important role in this virus–cell fusion, but molecular structural information about cholesterol–gp41 interaction is so far absent. Here, we present experimental and computational data about cholesterol complexation with gp41 in lipid bilayers. We focus on the C-terminal region of the protein, which comprises a membrane-proximal external region (MPER) and the transmembrane domain (TMD). We measured peptide–cholesterol contacts in virus-mimetic lipid bilayers using solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and augmented these experimental data with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. 2D 19F NMR spectra show correlation peaks between MPER residues and the cholesterol isooctyl tail, indicating that cholesterol is in molecular contact with the MPER–TMD trimer. 19F–13C distance measurements between the peptide and 13C-labeled cholesterol show that C17 on the D ring and C9 at the intersection of B and C rings are ~ 7.0 Å from the F673 side-chain 4-19F. At high peptide concentrations in the membrane, the 19F–13C distance data indicate three cholesterol molecules bound near F673 in each trimer. Mutation of a cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus motif did not change these distances, indicating that cholesterol binding does not require this sequence motif. Molecular dynamics simulations further identify two hotspots for cholesterol interactions. Taken together, these experimental data and simulations indicate that the helix-turn-helix conformation of the MPER–TMD is responsible for sequestering cholesterol. We propose that this gp41–cholesterol interaction mediates virus–cell fusion by recruiting gp41 to the boundary of the liquid-disordered and liquid-ordered phases to incur membrane curvature.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022283620304150;8.8;8.7;9.1;00222836;S0022283620304150;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0022283620304150;;

Here, we report primary results from a blinded phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide versus emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV prevention. Methods: This study is an ongoing, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, active-controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority trial done at 94 community, public health, and hospital-associated clinics located in regions of Europe and North America, where there is a high incidence of HIV or prevalence of people living with HIV, or both. We enrolled adult cisgender men who have sex with men and transgender women who have sex with men, both with a high risk of acquiring HIV on the basis of their self-reported sexual behaviour in the past 12 weeks or their recent history (within 24 weeks of enrolment) of bacterial sexually transmitted infections. Participants with current or previous use of PrEP with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were not excluded. We used a computer-generated random allocation sequence to randomly assign (1:1) participants to receive either emtricitabine (200 mg) and tenofovir alafenamide (25 mg) tablets daily, with matched placebo tablets (emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide group), or emtricitabine (200 mg) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg) tablets daily, with matched placebo tablets (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group). As such, all participants were given two tablets. The trial sponsor, investigators, participants, and the study staff who provided the study drugs, assessed the outcomes, and collected the data were masked to group assignment. The primary efficacy outcome was incident HIV infection, which was assessed when all participants had completed 48 weeks of follow-up and half of all participants had completed 96 weeks of follow-up. This full analysis set included all randomly assigned participants who had received at least one dose of the assigned study drug and had at least one post-baseline HIV test. Non-inferiority of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide to emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was established if the upper bound of the 95·003% CI of the HIV incidence rate ratio (IRR) was less than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 1·62. We prespecified six secondary bone mineral density and renal biomarker safety endpoints to evaluate using the safety analysis set. This analysis set included all randomly assigned participants who had received at least one dose of the assigned study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02842086, and is no longer recruiting. Findings: Between Sept 13, 2016, and June 30, 2017, 5387 (92%) of 5857 participants were randomly assigned and received emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (n=2694) or emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n=2693). At the time of the primary efficacy analysis (ie, when all participants had completed 48 weeks and 50% had completed 96 weeks) emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide was non-inferior to emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV prevention, as the upper limit of the 95% CI of the IRR, was less than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 1·62 (IRR 0·47 [95% CI 0·19–1·15]). After 8756 person-years of follow-up, 22 participants were diagnosed with HIV, seven participants in the emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide group (0·16 infections per 100 person-years [95% CI 0·06–0·33]), and 15 participants in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (0·34 infections per 100 person-years [0·19–0·56]). Both regimens were well tolerated, with a low number of participants reporting adverse events that led to discontinuation of the study drug (36 [1%] of 2694 participants in the emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide group vs 49 [2%] of 2693 participants in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group). Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide was superior to emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in all six prespecified bone mineral density and renal biomarker safety endpoints. Interpretation: Daily emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide shows non-inferior efficacy to daily emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV prevention, and the number of adverse events for both regimens was low. Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide had more favourable effects on bone mineral density and biomarkers of renal safety than emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

However, due to the emergence of new drug-resistant strains, the development of novel NNRTIs with adequate potency, improved resistance profiles and less toxicity is highly required. In this work, a novel virtual screening strategy combined with structure-based drug design was proposed to discover the potential inhibitors against drug-resistant HIV strains. Seven structure-variant RTs, ranging from the wild type to a hypothetical multi-mutant were regarded as target proteins to perform structure-based virtual screening. Totally 23 small molecules with good binding affinity were identified from the Traditional Chinese Medicine database (TCM) as potential NNRTIs candidates. Among these hits, (+)-Hinokinin has confirmed anti-HIV activity, and some hits are structurally identical with anti-HIV compounds. Almost all these hits are consistent with external experimental results. Molecular simulations analysis revealed that top 2 hits (Pallidisetin A and Pallidisetin B) bind stably and in high affinity to HIV-RT, which are ready to be experimental confirmed. These results suggested that the strategy we proposed is feasible, trustworthy and effective. Our finding might be helpful in the identification of novel NNRTIs against drug-resistant, and also provide a new clue for the discovery of HIV drugs in natural products. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Through interaction with the corresponding ligands, the chemokines, they induce a wide variety of cellular responses including cell polarization, movement, immune and inflammatory responses, as well as the prevention of HIV-1 infection. Like a Russian matryoshka doll, the chemokine receptor system is more complex than initially envisaged. This review focuses on the mechanisms that contribute to this dazzling complexity and how they modulate the signaling events triggered by chemokines. The chemokines and their receptors exist as monomers, dimers and oligomers, their expression pattern is highly regulated, and the ligands can bind distinct receptors with similar affinities. The use of novel imaging-based technologies, particularly real-time imaging modalities, has shed new light on the very dynamic conformations that chemokine receptors adopt depending on the cellular context, and that affect chemokine-mediated responses. This complex scenario presents both challenging and exciting opportunities for drug discovery.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006291X20304010;4.4;4.2;4.6;0006291X;S0006291X20304010;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006291X20304010;;

While butyrate is a known histone deacetylase inhibitor that activates expression of many genes involved in immune system pathways, its effects on virus infections and on the antiviral type I interferon (IFN) response have not been adequately investigated. We found that butyrate increases cellular infection with viruses relevant to human and animal health, including influenza virus, reovirus, HIV-1, human metapneumovirus, and vesicular stomatitis virus. Mechanistically, butyrate suppresses levels of specific antiviral IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) products, such as RIG-I and IFITM3, in human and mouse cells without inhibiting IFN-induced phosphorylation or nuclear translocation of the STAT1 and STAT2 transcription factors. Accordingly, we discovered that although butyrate globally increases baseline expression of more than 800 cellular genes, it strongly represses IFN-induced expression of 60% of ISGs and upregulates 3% of ISGs. Our findings reveal that there are differences in the IFN responsiveness of major subsets of ISGs depending on the presence of butyrate in the cell environment, and overall, they identify a new mechanism by which butyrate influences virus infection of cells.IMPORTANCE Butyrate is a lipid produced by intestinal bacteria. Here, we newly show that butyrate reprograms the innate antiviral immune response mediated by type I interferons (IFNs). Many of the antiviral genes induced by type I IFNs are repressed in the presence of butyrate, resulting in increased virus infection and replication. Our research demonstrates that metabolites produced by the gut microbiome, such as butyrate, can have complex effects on cellular physiology, including dampening of an inflammatory innate immune pathway resulting in a proviral cellular environment. Our work further suggests that butyrate could be broadly used as a tool to increase growth of virus stocks for research and for the generation of vaccines.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/16/e00326-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;;;;;

Evidence abounds that effector functions are important in controlling infections by influenza, Ebola, or HIV-1 in animal models. However, the relative contribution of virus neutralization versus effector functions to the overall antiviral activity of an antibody remains unknown. To address this fundamental question in immunology, we utilized our knowledge of HIV-1 dynamics to compare the kinetics of the viral load decline (VL) in infected animals given a wild-type (WT) anti–HIV-1 immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) versus those given a Fc-Null variant of the same antibody. In three independent experiments in HIV-1–infected humanized mice and one pivotal experiment in simian–human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected rhesus macaques, an earlier and sharper decline in viral load was consistently detected for the WT antibody. Quantifications of the observed differences indicate that Fc-mediated effector functions accounted for 25–45% of the total antiviral activity in these separate experiments. In this study, Fc-mediated effector functions have been quantified in vivo relative to the contribution of virus neutralization mediated by the Fab.;http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2008190117;17.1;16.1;15.7;00278424;;;;

Objective: To evaluate post-baseline resistance among patients in studies of once-daily (QD) darunavir-based regimens and formulations. Methods: The analysis included treatment-naïve and virologically failing or suppressed patients from 10 phase 2/3 studies (48–192 weeks in duration) of boosted darunavir 800 mg QD-based regimens. Three were phase 3 studies of the QD darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF) 800/150/200/10 mg single-tablet regimen. Post-baseline resistance was evaluated upon protocol-defined virologic failure (PDVF). Resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) were identified using International Antiviral Society-USA mutation lists. Phenotypic analyses varied across studies. Results: Overall, 250 of 3635 patients in the analysis met PDVF criteria; 205 had post-baseline genotypes/phenotypes. In total, four (0.1%) patients developed (or had identified) 1 darunavir and/or primary protease inhibitor (PI) RAM; only one (<0.1%) patient (with prior lopinavir virologic failure) lost darunavir phenotypic susceptibility. Among 3317 patients using nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs; mostly emtricitabine and tenofovir), 13 (0.4%) had 1 N(t)RTI RAM (10 with M184I/V). Among patients receiving D/C/F/TAF (n = 1949), none had post-baseline darunavir, primary PI, or tenofovir RAMs; only two (0.1%) patients developed an emtricitabine RAM, M184V/I. Conclusions: Across a large, diverse population using darunavir 800 mg QD-based regimens and formulations, resistance development remains rare. After clinical trials that span >10 years, loss of phenotypic susceptibility to darunavir was only observed once in a PI-experienced patient and has never been observed in treatment-naïve patients, treatment-experienced PI-naïve patients, or treatment-experienced virologically suppressed patients.";https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/25787489.2020.1794439;0;0;0.1;25787489;;;;

Here, we show that the dimeric 5-leader contains more than two dozen NC binding sites with affinities ranging from 40 nM to 1.4 M, and that all high-affinity sites (Kd  400 nM) reside within a 150-nt region of the leader sufficient to promote RNA packaging (core encapsidation signal, CES). The four initial binding sites with highest affinity reside near two symmetrically equivalent three-way junction structures. Unlike the other high-affinity sites, which bind NC with exothermic energetics, binding to these sites occurs endothermically due to concomitant unwinding of a weakly base-paired [UUUU]:[GGAG] helical element. Mutations that stabilize base pairing within this element eliminate NC binding to this site and severely impair RNA packaging into virus-like particles. NMR studies reveal that a recently discovered small-molecule inhibitor of HIV-1 RNA packaging that appears to function by stabilizing the structure of the leader binds directly to the [UUUU]:[GGAG] helix. Our findings suggest a sequential NC binding mechanism for Gag-genome assembly and identify a potential RNA Achilles’ heel to which HIV therapeutics may be targeted.;http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2008519117;17.1;16.1;15.7;00278424;;;;

Since new insertions can have detrimental consequences, cells need to efficiently control LINE-1 retrotransposition. Here, we demonstrate that the intrinsic immune factor TRIM5 senses and restricts LINE-1 retroelements. Previously, rhesus TRIM5 has been shown to efficiently block HIV-1 replication, while human TRIM5 was found to be less active. Surprisingly, we found that both human and rhesus TRIM5 efficiently repress human LINE-1 retrotransposition. TRIM5 interacts with LINE-1 ribonucleoprotein complexes in the cytoplasm, which is essential for restriction. In line with its postulated role as pattern recognition receptor, we show that TRIM5 also induces innate immune signaling upon interaction with LINE-1 ribonucleoprotein complexes. The signaling events activate the transcription factors AP-1 and NF-B, leading to the down-regulation of LINE-1 promoter activity. Together, our findings identify LINE-1 as important target of human TRIM5, which restricts and senses LINE-1 via two distinct mechanisms. Our results corroborate TRIM5 as pattern recognition receptor and shed light on its previously undescribed activity against mobile genetic elements, such as LINE-1, to protect the integrity of our genome.;http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1922366117;17.1;16.1;15.7;00278424;;;;

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The Siah1 and Siah2 ubiquitin ligases are implicated in diverse biological processes ranging from cellular stress responses, signaling to transcriptional regulation. A key substrate of Siah1 is ELL2, which undergoes proteolysis upon polyubiquitination. ELL2 stimulates transcriptional elongation and is a subunit of the Super Elongation Complex (SEC) essential for HIV-1 transactivation. Previously, multiple transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms are reported to control Siah's expression and activity. Here we show that the activity of Siah1/2 can also be suppressed by host cell factor 1 (HCF1), and the hitherto poorly characterized HCF2, which themselves are not degraded but can bind and block the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of Siah1/2 to prevent their autoubiquitination and trans-ubiquitination of downstream targets including ELL2. This effect stabilizes ELL2 and enhances the ELL2-SEC formation for robust HIV-1 transactivation. Thus, our study not only identifies HCF1/2 as novel activators of HIV-1 transcription through inhibiting Siah1 to stabilize ELL2, but also reveals the SBD of Siah1/2 as a previously unrecognized new target for HCF1/2 to exert this inhibition.;https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkaa461/5849913;19.7;20.2;21.1;;;;;

ZBTB7A was initially isolated as a protein that binds to the inducer of the short transcript of HIV-1 virus TAT gene promoter. The protein forms a homodimer through protein-protein interaction via the N-terminus POZ-domains. ZBTB7A typically binds to the DNA elements through its zinc-finger domains and represses transcription both by modification of the chromatin organization and through the direct recruitment of transcription factors to gene regulatory regions. ZBTB7A is involved in several fundamental biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and development. It also participates in hematopoiesis, adipogenesis, chondrogenesis, cellular metabolism and alternative splicing of BCLXL, DNA repair, development of oligodendrocytes, osteoclast and unfolded protein response. Aberrant ZBTB7A expression promotes oncogenic transformation and tumor progression, but also maintains a tumor suppressive role depending on the type and genetic context of cancer. In this comprehensive review we provide information about the structure, function, targets, and regulators of ZBTB7A and its role as an oncogenic driver and transcriptional repressor in various human diseases.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0304383520302019;9.4;10.4;11.6;03043835;S0304383520302019;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0304383520302019;;

Methods: This study prospectively analyzed 105 HIV/AIDS patients undergoing HAART and 35 HIV-1-negative cases (healthy controls). Flow cytometry was used to detect the activation of T lymphocytes and the percentages of CD4+ CD45RA+ T cell subsets in whole blood samples taken from healthy controls and HIV/AIDS patients before and after therapy. Results: The activation of T lymphocytes was significantly enhanced in the 105 HIV/AIDS patients than in the healthy controls before treatment (P<0.01). The activated T lymphocytes gradually decreased after HAART. Firstly, CD4+ CD38+ HLA-DR+, CD8+ CD38+ and CD8+ HLA-DR+ T lymphocytes decreased one month after therapy (P<0.05). Then, four indicators of T lymphocyte activation including the expression of CD8+ CD38+ HLA-DR+ T lymphocytes decreased significantly six months after therapy (P<0.01). The percentage of CD8+ CD38+ HLA-DR+ T lymphocytes detected 12 months after therapy was significantly lower than that analyzed six months after therapy (P<0.01). No significant difference was found in the expression of the other three indicators for activation (P>0.05). Twelve months after therapy, the four indicators for T lymphocyte activation in HIV/AIDS patients were still significantly higher than those of the control group (P<0.01). The percentages of CD4+ CD45RA+ T lymphocytes in HIV/AIDS patients were significantly lower than those in healthy controls before and 12 months after treatment (P>0.05). Conclusions: HAART could reduce immune activation after six months of treatment, but could not reverse the activation nor restore the expression of CD4+ CD45RA+ T lymphocytes in HIV/AIDS patients.;http://journal.yiigle.com/LinkIn.do?linkin_type=DOI&DOI=10.3760/cma.j.cn112309-20200106-00008;0.2;0.3;0.3;02545101;;;;

Methods: Sequences of the envelope glycoprotein (Env) obtained from DRVI01 at different time points were analyzed by comparing with the key amino acids of reported HIV-1 bNAbs in HIV Database. After reverse mutation of key amino acids that had frequently mutated to wild type, the neutralizing sensitivity of autologous plasma against wild-type and mutated Env-pesudoviruses was compared and the potential bNAbs in DRVI01 were speculated. Results: Reported key amino acids of 10 bNAbs classes were detected in 155 Env sequences derived from DRVI01. Frequent mutations were found in key amino acids of two bNAbs classes of gp41 fusion domain and gp120/gp41 interface. Neutralizing sensitivity of the contemporaneous autologous plasma and the plasma collected at the next time point against the mutated pesudoviruses was significantly increased as compared with wild-type pesudoviruses.

All rights reserved.Background: A decrease in the number of viruses or viral nucleic acid components will determine whether a therapy successfully eradicates the virus. Sensitivity and specificity are needed to enable easy, precise and efficient diagnosis and evaluation of therapy. This study examined the sensitivity of quantitative PCR (qPCR) for detecting viral nucleic acids as compared with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) p24 antigen after hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Materials and Methods: In this study, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy whole blood and inoculated HIV-1/MT4 virus in PBMC cultures were isolated. The cultures were exposed to hyperbaric oxygen at 2.4 ATA with 100% O2 for 3 × 30 minutes for 5 days. ELISA and qPCR were used to measure the p24 antigen and HIV-1 mRNA, respectively, in the treatment and control groups. Result: The amounts of p24 antigen and HIV-1 mRNA were significantly different (p = 0.001, p < ). The two examination methods were significantly different. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy can reduce virus numbers, as observed from the p24 antigen and HIV-1 mRNA levels. The treatment group had significantly lower virus numbers than the control group. HIV-1 mRNA detection is more sensitive than p24 antigen detection. Conclusion: Both qPCR and ELISA have their advantages, depending on whether the goal is to establish, diagnose or monitor antiretroviral therapy or to evaluate disease progression.;None;0.5;0.5;1.2;20060165;;;;

In recent years, research findings on the benefits of anti-oxidant foods and supplements have been employed in counter-acting both oxidative stress as well as inflammation in order to reduce the adverse side effects of anti-retroviral therapy. One such natural flavonoid which possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties is quercetin. This study investigated the effect of quercetin in overcoming the side effects incurred due to rilpivirine administration. The results show substantial reduction in the accumulation of triglyceride levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner for adipose cells treated with either rilpivirine or quercetin alone and in combination, as evidenced by morphological pictures and quantitative measurement of triglycerides throughout the differentiation process. Levels of inflammatory markers such as resistin and IL-8 were increased as compared to the untreated cells. No significant changes in leptin were observed on treatment of adipose cells with rilpivirine alone and its levels were almost comparable to control. Levels of oxidative markers like superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione were also decreased. Treatment with quercetin showed a decrease in the inflammatory status and an increase in the oxidative status of adipose cells, thereby exhibiting its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. However, further assessment of lipid metabolism and adipose tissue function in patients administered with rilpivirine-based regimes is advisable considering that totally neutral effects of rilpivirine on lipid homeostasis cannot be anticipated from the current study in vitro. It is concluded that rilpivirine causes an anti-adipogenic and pro-inflammatory response pattern but only at high concentrations, whereas quercetin has been observed to decrease inflammation and restore the levels of anti-oxidant enzymes.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11010-020-03744-4;5.6;5.0;5.1;03008177;;;;

Therefore, interfering with the NHR-CHR interaction of gp41 is a promising therapeutic approach against HIV-1. However, a full understanding of the molecular and mechanistic details of this interaction is still incomplete. Here, we use single-chain, chimeric proteins (named covNHR) that reproduce accurately the CHR-NHR interactions to analyze the binding thermodynamics of several peptides with different length from the CHR region. The results indicate that cooperative binding involving two or more pockets of the NHR groove is necessary to obtain relevant affinities and that the binding energy is broadly distributed along the interface, underlining a crucial role of a middle pocket to achieve tight binding. In contrast, targeting only the deep hydrophobic pocket is insufficient to achieve significant affinity. Moreover, calorimetry experiments in combination with limited proteolysis performed using a mutant with occluded binding in the N-terminal pocket reveal the existence of an allosteric communication between the different regions. This study is the first detailed thermodynamic dissection of the NHR-CHR interaction in gp41 and contributes therefore to a better understanding of HIV fusion. These results are relevant for the development of potential fusion inhibitors.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003986120304100;6.4;6.1;6.3;00039861;S0003986120304100;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0003986120304100;;

The cross-neutralization between these viruses is currently not well-defined. Methods: Here, by using the live SARS-CoV-2 virus infection assay as well as HIV-1 based pseudotyped-virus carrying the spike (S) gene of the SARS-CoV-2 (ppSARS-2) and SARS-CoV (ppSARS), we examined whether infections with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can induce cross-neutralizing antibodies. Findings: We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor for SARS-CoV, and we also found that the recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein of SARS-CoV effectively inhibits ppSARS-2 entry in Huh7.5 cells. However, convalescent sera from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 patients showed high neutralizing activity only against the homologous virus, with no or limited cross-neutralization activity against the other pseudotyped virus. Similar results were also observed in vaccination studies in mice. Interpretation: Our study demonstrates that although both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 as a cellular receptor, the neutralization epitopes are not shared by these two closely-related viruses, highlighting challenges towards developing a universal vaccine against SARS-CoV related viruses.

Genes to Cells published by Molecular Biology Society of Japan and John Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdAlthough several nucleo(s)tide analogs are available for treatment of HBV infection, long-term treatment with these drugs can lead to the emergence of drug-resistant viruses. Recent HIV-1 studies suggest that combination therapies using nucleo(s)tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleo(s)tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) could drastically inhibit the viral genome replication of NRTI-resistant viruses. In order to carry out such combinational therapy against HBV, several new NRTIs and NNRTIs should be developed. Here, we aimed to identify novel NNRTIs targeting the HBV polymerase terminal protein (TP)-reverse transcriptase (RT) (TP-RT) domain, which is a critical domain for HBV replication. We expressed and purified the HBV TP-RT with high purity using an Escherichia coli expression system and established an in vitro  RNA-binding assay system. Then, we used TP-RT in cell-free assays to screen candidate inhibitors from a chemical compound library, and identified two compounds, 6-hydroxy-DL-DOPA and N-oleoyldopamine, which inhibited the binding of  RNA with the HBV polymerase. Furthermore, these drugs reduced HBV DNA levels in cell-based assays as well by inhibiting packaging of pregenome RNA into capsids. The novel screening system developed herein should open a new pathway the discovery of drugs targeting the HBV TP-RT domain to treat HBV infection.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gtc.12778;3.6;3.3;3.4;13569597;;;;

Self-reported neurocognitive impairment (SRNI) in people living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is frequent. We use longitudinal information on SRNI in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) to identify and characterize groups of patients with persisting SRNI over time. Methods. We included all SHCS patients who were assessed for SRNI during at least 5 visits spanning at least 2.5 years in 2013-2017. We first compared patients with SRNI to those without SRNI over the whole study period. Second, we used a hierarchical cluster algorithm to identify groups of patients with similar changes of SRNI over time. In both analyses, we studied clinical and demographic factors potentially influencing SRNI. Results. In total, 79 683 questionnaires of 11 029 patients contained information about SRNI, and 8545 of 11 029 (77.5%) patients had longitudinal information. The overall percentage of patients with SRNI decreased from 19.6% in 2013 to 10.7% in 2017. Compared to patients in the cluster with low-level SRNI over time, patients in the cluster with high-level persisting SRNI more often had a prior opportunistic infection of the central nervous system (CNS) (odds ratio [OR], 3.7; P < .001), imperfect adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) (OR, 2.8; P < .001), and depression (OR, 1.9; P < .001). Conclusions. Although overall SRNI is decreasing in the SHCS, there is a group of patients with persisting SRNI over time. Past opportunistic infections of the CNS, imperfect adherence to ART, and depression were associated most with persisting SRNI. Patients with these characteristics should be preferentially tested for neurocognitive impairment.";https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/3/637/5558412;14.0;13.8;12.5;10584838;;;;

The ability to latently infect T-cells enables HIV-1 to establish persistent infections in resting memory CD4+ T-lymphocytes which become reactivated following the disruption or cessation of intensive drug therapy. The maintenance of viral latency occurs through epigenetic and non-epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic mechanisms of HIV latency regulation involve the deacetylation and methylation of histone proteins within nucleosome 1 (nuc-1) at the viral long terminal repeats (LTR) such that the inhibition of histone deacetyltransferase and histone lysine methyltransferase activities, respectively, reactivates HIV from latency. Non-epigenetic mechanisms involve the nuclear restriction of critical cellular transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-B) or nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) which activate transcription from the viral LTR, limiting the nuclear levels of the viral transcription transactivator protein Tat and its cellular co-factor positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which together regulate HIV transcriptional elongation. In this article, we review how T-cell receptor (TCR) activation efficiently induces NF-B, NFAT, and activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factors through multiple signal pathways and how these factors efficiently regulate HIV LTR transcription through the non-epigenetic mechanism. We further discuss how elongation factor P-TEFb, induced through an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent mechanism, regulates HIV transcriptional elongation before new Tat is synthesized and the role of AP-1 in the modulation of HIV transcriptional elongation through functional synergy with NF-B. Furthermore, we discuss how TCR signaling induces critical post-translational modifications of the cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) subunit of P-TEFb which enhances interactions between P-TEFb and the viral Tat protein and the resultant enhancement of HIV transcriptional elongation.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/8/868;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

The aim of the present study was building up of QSAR models for anti-HIV activity by means of the CORAL software (http://www.insilico.eu/coral). Applying of correlation weights for five and six-member molecular rings as components of the target function in the Monte Carlo optimization that is aimed to build up correlation between activity of HIV-1 protease inhibitors expressed as pIC50 = lg[1/(IC50 × 109)] and optimal descriptor improves the predictive potential. Simplified molecular input-line entry system (SMILES) is used as the representation of the molecular structure of HIV-1 protease inhibitors for the QSAR analysis. New criterion of predictive potential so-called index of ideality of correlation (IIC) has been appllied to improve the model for HIV-1 protease inhibitors activity. High correlation coefficients were observed between the experimental and predicted anti-HIV activity. Applying of special ring code as component of the Monte Carlo calculation significantly improves the statistical quality of the model. Furthermore, applying of the IIC as component of the Monte Carlo optimization improves the predictive potential of the CORAL models. The presence of the rings and the quality of these are very important molecular features which are able to improve statistical quality of model for anti-HIV activity. In addition, the ability of IIC to improve predictive potential of a model has been confirmed.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11224-020-01525-9;3.1;2.9;3.0;10400400;;;;

DESIGN: A pilot study including 10 antiretroviral therapy-treated HIV-1-infected men and 50 uninfected controls was performed to identify the main gut dysbiosis determinants (e.g. Prevotella enrichment), that may affect mucosal antiviral defenses and T cell immunity in HIV-1-infected individuals. METHODS: 16rRNA gene sequencing was applied to the HIV-1-infected individuals' fecal microbiota and compared with controls. Measurements of CD4 and CD8 T cell activation [CD38, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, CD38 HLA-DR] and frequencies of Th17, obtained from lamina propria lymphocytes isolated from five different intestinal sites, were performed by flow cytometry. IFN, IFNAR1 and MxA gene expression level was evaluated by real-time PCR in lamina propria lymphocytes. Nonparametric t tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: HIV-1-infected men had a significant fecal microbial communities' imbalance, including different levels of genera Faecalibacterium, Prevotella, Alistipes and Bacteroides, compared with controls. Notably, Prevotella abundance positively correlated with frequencies of CD4 T cells expressing CD38 or HLA-DR and coexpressing CD38 and HLA-DR (P < 0.05 for all these measures). The same trend was observed for the activated CD8 T cells. Moreover, Prevotella levels were inversely correlated with IFN-I genes (P < 0.05 for IFN, IFNAR1 and MxA genes) and the frequencies of Th17 cells (P < 0.05). By contrast, no statistically significant correlations were observed for the remaining bacterial genera. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Prevotella enrichment might affect gut mucosal IFN-I pathways and T cell response in HIV-1-infected patients, thus contributing to immune dysfunction.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAD.0000000000002574;8.8;7.1;7.5;;;;;

Here we characterize the frequency and types of potential DDIs (pDDIs) in hospitalized HIV patients presenting with suspected cryptococcal or tuberculous meningitis. Methods: In a retrospective review of three cryptococcal meningitis trials between 2010 and 2017 in Kampala, Uganda, medications received over hospitalization were documented and pDDI events were assessed. IBM Micromedex DRUGDEX® online drug reference system was used to identify and describe potential interactions as either contraindicated, major, moderate or minor. For antiretroviral DDIs, the Liverpool Drug Interactions Checker from the University of Liverpool was also used to further describe interactions observed. Results: In 1074 patients with suspected meningitis, pDDIs were present in 959 (overall prevalence = 89.3%) during the analyzed 30 day window. In total, 278 unique interacting drug pairs were identified resulting in 4582 pDDI events. Of all patients included in this study there was a mean frequency of 4.27 pDDIs per patient. Of the 4582 pDDI events, 11.3% contraindicated, 66.4% major, 17.4% moderate and 5% minor pDDIs were observed. Among all pDDIs identified, the most prevalent drugs implicated were fluconazole (58.4%), co-trimoxazole (25.7%), efavirenz (15.6%) and rifampin (10.2%). Twenty-one percent of the contraindicated pDDIs and 27% of the major ones involved an antiretroviral drug. Increased likelihood of QT interval prolongation was the most frequent potential clinical outcome. Dissonance in drug interaction checkers was noted requiring clinicians to consult more than one database in making clinical decisions about drug combinations. Conclusions: The overall prevalence of pDDIs in this population is high. An understanding of drug combinations likely to result in undesired clinical outcomes, such as QT interval prolongation, is paramount. This is especially important in resource limited settings where availability of therapeutic drug monitoring and laboratory follow-up are inconsistent. Adequate quantification of the increased likelihood of adverse clinical outcomes from multiple drug-drug interactions of the same kind in a single patient is needed to aid clinical decisions in this setting.;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05296-w;4.5;4.3;4.1;;;;;

All rights reserved.Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are associated with the development of painful neuropathies and may further aggravate sensory neuropathy produced by HIV-1 infection, leading to discontinuation of NRTI therapy by HIV patients. Following antiretroviral-induced peripheral neuropathy, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is activated in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord. However, the contribution of individual JNK genes remains unknown. Here, we have tested the behavioural mechanical sensitivity of JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3 knockout (KO) mice in the von Frey test after treatment with 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC). Protein expression was investigated in the spinal cord of wild type (wt) and KO mice by western blotting. The onset of neuropathic pain was prevented by the deletion of JNK3, leading us to hypothesize that JNK3 protein plays a major role in the regulation of pain threshold in antiretroviral neuropathy. The growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and the transcription factor c-Jun are involved in regeneration processes. This study revealed an up-regulation of GAP-43 and c-Jun protein, 14 days after ddC administration. JNK1 deletion induced a significant reduction in c-Jun phosphorylation and GAP-43 protein contents. In contrast, there was no difference in ddC-induced reduction of hind paw intraepidermal nerve fibre density in all JNK KO mice. Overall, these findings indicate that JNK3 plays a critical role in regulating ddC neurotoxicity-induced mechanical pain hypersensitivity, while JNK1 is important for activation of c-Jun and GAP-43 as a critical pathway of a regeneration program. These data highlight the impact of individual JNK isoforms on antiretroviral neurotoxicity and neuro-regeneration processes.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014299920302533;5.7;5.9;5.5;;S0014299920302533;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0014299920302533;;

We modified the integration machinery of LVs and harnessed the cellular DNA double-strand break repair machinery to integrate transgenes into ribosomal DNA, a promising genomic safe-harbor site for transgenes. LVs carrying modified I-PpoI-derived homing endonuclease proteins were characterized in detail, and we found that at least 21% of all integration sites localized to ribosomal DNA when LV transduction was coupled to target DNA cleavage. In addition to the primary sequence recognized by the endonuclease, integration was also enriched in chromatin domains topologically associated with nucleoli, which contain the targeted ribosome RNA genes. Targeting of this highly repetitive region for integration was not associated with detectable DNA deletions or negative impacts on cell health in transduced primary human T cells. The modified LVs characterized here have an overall lower risk for insertional mutagenesis than regular LVs and can thus improve the safety of gene and cellular therapy.© 2020 The American Society of Gene and Cell TherapyRandom integration of therapeutic genes can cause undesired side effects.

All rights reserved.CD4-based decoy approaches against HIV-1 are attractive options for long-term viral control, but initial designs, including soluble CD4 (sCD4) and CD4-Ig, were ineffective. To evaluate a therapeutic that more accurately mimics HIV-1 target cells compared with monomeric sCD4 and dimeric CD4-Ig, we generated virus-like nanoparticles that present clusters of membrane-associated CD4 (CD4-VLPs) to permit high-avidity binding of trimeric HIV-1 envelope spikes. In neutralization assays, CD4-VLPs were >12,000-fold more potent than sCD4 and CD4-Ig and >100-fold more potent than the broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) 3BNC117, with >12,000-fold improvements against strains poorly neutralized by 3BNC117. CD4-VLPs also neutralized patient-derived viral isolates that were resistant to 3BNC117 and other bNAbs. Intraperitoneal injections of CD4-CCR5-VLP produced only subneutralizing plasma concentrations in HIV-1-infected humanized mice but elicited CD4-binding site mutations that reduced viral fitness. All mutant viruses showed reduced sensitivity to sCD4 and CD4-Ig but remained sensitive to neutralization by CD4-VLPs in vitro. In vitro evolution studies demonstrated that CD4-VLPs effectively controlled HIV-1 replication at neutralizing concentrations, and viral escape was not observed. Moreover, CD4-VLPs potently neutralized viral swarms that were completely resistant to CD4-Ig, suggesting that escape pathways that confer resistance against conventional CD4-based inhibitors are ineffective against CD4-VLPs. These findings suggest that therapeutics that mimic HIV-1 target cells could prevent viral escape by exposing a universal vulnerability of HIV-1: The requirement to bind CD4 on a target cell. We propose that therapeutic and delivery strategies that ensure durable bioavailability need to be developed to translate this concept into a clinically feasible functional cure therapy.;http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2010320117;17.1;16.1;15.7;00278424;;;;

We present a molecular dynamics simulation study on the binding mechanism of the membrane targeting domain of HIV-1 Gag protein. The matrix (MA) domain drives Gag onto the plasma membrane through electrostatic interactions at its highly-basic-region (HBR), located near the myristoylated (Myr) N-terminus of the protein. Our study suggests Myr insertion is involved in the sorting of membrane lipids around the protein-binding site to prepare it for viral assembly. Our realistic membrane models confirm interactions with PIP2 and PS lipids are highly favored around the HBR and are strong enough to keep the protein bound even without Myr insertion. We characterized Myr insertion events from microsecond trajectories and examined the membrane response upon initial membrane targeting by MA. Insertion events only occur with one of the membrane models, showing a combination of surface charge and internal membrane structure modulate this process.;https://elifesciences.org/articles/58621;10.0;10.8;10.8;;;;;

However, recent reports have suggested that CGs also possess anticancer and antiviral activities. The primary mechanism of action of these anticancer agents is by suppressing the Na+/k+-ATPase by decreasing the intracellular K+ and increasing the Na+ and Ca2+. Additionally, CGs were known to act as inhibitors of IL8 production, DNA topoisomerase I and II, anoikis prevention and suppression of several target genes responsible for the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, CGs were reported to be effective against several DNA and RNA viral species such as influenza, human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, coronavirus, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus and Ebola virus. CGs were reported to suppress the HIV-1 gene expression, viral protein translation and alters viral pre-mRNA splicing to inhibit the viral replication. To date, four CGs (Anvirzel, UNBS1450, PBI05204 and digoxin) were in clinical trials for their anticancer activity. This review encapsulates the current knowledge about CGs as anticancer and antiviral drugs in isolation and in combination with some other drugs to enhance their efficiency. Further studies of this class of biomolecules are necessary to determine their possible inhibitory role in cancer and viral diseases.;https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/25/16/3596;4.5;4.1;4.1;;;;;

The current stable HIV prevalence may be driven by factors such as a high incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and high-risk behaviours. In sub-Saharan Africa, it has previously been observed that up to 50% of HIV cases were attributed to herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) among low-risk populations. Because the proportion of sexually transmitted HSV-1 is rising, it is essential to study the interaction between HSV-1 and HIV infections. Methods: We conducted a study in Mbeya region using the archived blood sera of participants from the recently completed EU-funded EMINI project. A specially designed questionnaire was used to obtain the social and demographic characteristics of the study participants in the database. We tested archived participants' sera for herpes simplex virus type 1 using Virotech HSV-1 (gG1) IgG ELISA (Enzygnost, Behring, Germany). Univariate and multivariate Poisson regression models were used to identify factors associated with HSV-1. Results: A total of 640 adults were randomly recruited after stratification by HIV status (318 were HIV positive), age, and sex. The overall seroprevalence of HSV-1 in the study population was 92.1%. The extrapolated seroprevalence estimate of herpes simplex virus type 1 in the general population was 95.0% (96.0% in males versus 94.0% in females). Males and females were equally affected by HSV-1. HSV-1 was less prevalent in HIV-positive individuals than in HIV-negative individuals. Conclusion: People living with HIV were less likely to be HSV-1 seropositive. Further prospective studies are necessary to conclude a causal association.;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05301-2;4.5;4.3;4.1;;;;;

Previously, HLA-associated mutations 102H, 105R, 108D, and 199Y were individually statistically associated with decreased Nef-mediated HLA-I downregulation ability in a cohort of 298 HIV-1 subtype C infected individuals. In the present study, these mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into different patient-derived Nef sequence backgrounds of high similarity to the consensus C Nef sequence, and their ability to downregulate HLA-I was measured by flow cytometry in a CEM-derived T cell line. A substantial negative effect of 199Y on HLA-I downregulation and Nef expression was observed, while 102H and 105R displayed negative effects on HLA-I downregulation ability and Nef expression to a lesser extent. The total magnitude of CTL responses in individuals harboring the 199Y mutation was lower than those without the mutation, although this was not statistically significant. Overall, a modest positive relationship between Nef-mediated HLA-I downregulation ability and total magnitude of CTL responses was observed, suggesting that there is a higher requirement for HLA-I downregulation with increased CTL pressure. These results highlight a region of Nef that could be targeted by vaccine-induced CTL to reduce HLA-I downregulation and maximize CTL efficacy.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25676;3.8;3.9;4.0;01466615;;;;

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-derived LVs have been vastly studied to become an invaluable asset in gene delivery. This abled LVs to be used in both research laboratories and gene therapy. Pseudotyping HIV-1 based LVs, abled it to transduce different types of cells, especially hematopoietic stem cells. A wide range of tropism, plus to the ability to integrate genes into target cells, made LVs an armamentarium in gene therapy. The third and fourth generations of self-inactivating LVs are being used to achieve safe gene therapy. Not only advanced methods enabled the clinical-grade LV production on a large scale, but also considerably heightened transduction efficiency. One of which is microfluidic systems that revolutionized gene delivery approaches. Since gene therapy using LVs attracted lots of attention to itself, we provided a brief review of LV structure and life-cycle along with methods for improving both LV production and transduction. Also, we mentioned some of their utilization in immunotherapy and gene therapy.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0753332220304686;2.8;4.0;6.4;07533322;S0753332220304686;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0753332220304686;;

During this process, the nascent virion incorporates specific subsets of cellular lipids and host membrane proteins, in addition to viral glycoproteins and viral genomic RNA. Gag binding to the PM is regulated by cellular factors, including PM-specific phospholipid PI(4,5)P2 and tRNAs, both of which bind the highly basic region in the matrix domain of Gag. In this article, we review our current understanding of the roles played by cellular lipids and tRNAs in specific localization of HIV-1 Gag to the PM. Furthermore, we examine the effects of PM-bound Gag on the organization of the PM bilayer and discuss how the reorganization of the PM at the virus assembly site potentially contributes to the enrichment of host transmembrane proteins in the HIV-1 particle. Since some of these host transmembrane proteins alter release, attachment, or infectivity of the nascent virions, the mechanism of Gag targeting to the PM and the nature of virus assembly sites have major implications in virus spread.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/8/842;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

Methods: The British HIV Association (BHIVA) invited HIV clinical care sites to provide retrospective data from case notes of up to 40 adults aged  50 years with HIV-1 infection attending the clinic for care during 2017 and/or 2018, using a structured dynamic online questionnaire. Results: A total of 4959 questionnaires from 141 clinical services were returned. Regarding the key targets specified in the BHIVA monitoring guidelines, 97% of patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) had had their viral load measured in the last 9 months, or 15 months if on a protease inhibitor, and 94% had had all medications recorded in the last 15 months. Only 67% of patients on ART without cardiovascular disease (CVD) had had a 10-year CVD risk calculated in the last 3 years. It was reported that 80% and 92% had had their smoking status documented in the last 2 years and blood pressure checked in the last 15 months, respectively. HIV services had communicated with the general practitioners of 90% of consenting individuals, but consulted electronic primary care records for only 10%.

Thus, early treated individuals are preferred candidates to evaluate novel viral remission strategies. However, their cART-dependent HIV-1 DNA decay dynamics are still poorly defined. This can hamper the design and interpretation of results from clinical trials intended to further reduce viral reservoirs. OBJECTIVES: To clarify the duration of cART needed for the HIV-1 reservoir to be stabilized in early treated individuals. METHODS: We characterized the longitudinal decline of total HIV-1 DNA levels by droplet digital PCR in 21 individuals initiating cART within 6 months after estimated HIV-1 acquisition. Measurements were taken at cART initiation, after 6 months and annually until Year 4. Correlations between virological and clinical parameters were statistically analysed. Statistical modelling was performed applying a mixed-effects model. RESULTS: Total HIV-1 DNA experienced a median overall decrease of 1.43 log10 units (IQR = 1.17-1.69) throughout the 4 years of follow-up. Baseline levels for total HIV-1 DNA, viral load, absolute CD4+ T cell count and CD4+/CD8+ ratio correlate with final HIV-1 DNA measurements (R2 = 0.68, P < 0.001; R2 = 0.54, P = 0.012; R2 = -0.47, P = 0.031; and R2 = -0.59, P = 0.0046, respectively). Statistical modelling shows that after 2 years on cART the viral reservoir had reached a set point. CONCLUSIONS: A waiting period of 2 years on cART should be considered when designing interventions aiming to impact latent HIV-1 reservoir levels and viral rebound kinetics after cART discontinuation, in order to facilitate interpretation of results and enhance the chance of viral control.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jac/dkaa139/5825343;8.7;7.7;8.3;;;;;

Accumulating evidences suggest that T-cell line tropic X4 gp120 increases macrophage infiltration into the peripheral nerves, and thereby induces neuroinflammation leading to pain. However, the mechanisms underlying X4 gp120-induced macrophage recruitment to the peripheral nervous systems remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that perineural application of X4 gp120 from HIV-1 strains IIIB and MN elicited mechanical hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain-like behaviors in mice. Furthermore, flow cytometry and immunohistochemical studies revealed increased infiltration of bone marrow-derived macrophages into the parenchyma of sciatic nerves and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) 7 days after gp120 IIIB or MN application. Chemical deletion of circulating macrophages using clodronate liposomes markedly suppressed gp120 IIIB-induced pain-like behaviors. In in vitro cell infiltration analysis, RAW 264.7 cell (a murine macrophage cell line) was chemoattracted to conditioned medium from gp120 IIIB- or MN-treated cultured Schwann cells, but not to conditioned medium from these gp120-treated DRG neurons, suggesting possible involvement of Schwann cell-derived soluble factors in macrophage infiltration. We identified using a gene expression array that CXCL1, a chemoattractant of macrophages and neutrophils, was increased in gp120 IIIB-treated cultured Schwann cells. Similar to gp120 IIIB or MN, perineural application of recombinant CXCL1 elicited pain-like behaviors accompanied by macrophage infiltration to the peripheral nerves. Furthermore, the repeated injection of CXCR2 (receptor for CXCL1) antagonist or CXCL1 neutralizing antibody prevented both pain-like behaviors and macrophage infiltration in gp120 IIIB-treated mice. Thus, the present study newly defines that Schwann cell-derived CXCL1, secreted in response to X4 gp120 exposure, is responsible for macrophage infiltration into peripheral nerves, and is thereby associated with pain-like behaviors in mice. We propose herein that communication between Schwann cells and macrophages may play a prominent role in the induction of X4 HIV-1-associated pain.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0889159119312334;10.7;11.0;10.7;08891591;S0889159119312334;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0889159119312334;;

Of 25,131 eligible adults aged 15-64 years, 20,577 (81.8%) consented to face-to-face questionnaire and biomarker testing in this nationally representative household survey. Home-based rapid HIV testing was performed using Determine, First Response, and STAT-PAK as the tiebreaker. HIV-positive tests were confirmed in a laboratory using Geenius HIV-1/2; viral load (VL) was measured using Roche TaqMan and BioMerieux NucliSENS. Recency of infection was tested using Sedia HIV-1 Limiting Antigen (LAg)-Avidity. Presence of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs was detected using high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS). The recent infection testing algorithm included LAg-avidity enzyme immunoassay [normalized optical density (ODn 1.5), VL 1,000 copies/mL, and absence of ARV drugs]. Weighted annual HIV incidence was compared with United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) Spectrum models estimates. Overall, 26 of 2,901 HIV-seropositive individuals had a recent infection (men, 8; women, 18). Overall weighted annual incidence among persons aged 15-64 years was 0.42% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25-0.59] and was 0.44% (95% CI: 0.25-0.62) for those aged 15-49 years, similar to 2016 Spectrum model estimate (0.54%, 95% CI: 0.49-0.66) for this age group.

Potent clinical inhibitors of HIV-1 protease show several orders of magnitude worse inhibition of highly drug-resistant variants. Hence, the structure and enzyme activities were analyzed for HIV protease mutant HIV-1 protease (EC 3.4.23.16) (PR) with 22 mutations (PRS5B) from a clinical isolate that was selected by machine learning to represent high-level drug-resistance. PRS5B has 22 mutations including only one (I84V) in the inhibitor binding site; however, clinical inhibitors had poor inhibition of PRS5B activity with kinetic inhibition value (Ki) values of 4–1000 nm or 18- to 8000-fold worse than for wild-type PR. High-resolution crystal structures of PRS5B complexes with the best inhibitors, amprenavir (APV) and darunavir (DRV) (Ki ~ 4 nm), revealed only minor changes in protease-inhibitor interactions. Instead, two distinct clusters of mutations in distal regions induce coordinated conformational changes that decrease favorable internal interactions across the entire protein subunit. The largest structural rearrangements are described and compared to other characterized resistant mutants. In the protease hinge region, the N83D mutation eliminates a hydrogen bond connecting the hinge and core of the protease and increases disorder compared to highly resistant mutants PR with 17 mutations and PR with 20 mutations with similar hinge mutations. In a distal -sheet, mutations G73T and A71V coordinate with accessory mutations to bring about shifts that propagate throughout the subunit. Molecular dynamics simulations of ligand-free dimers show differences consistent with loss of interactions in mutant compared to wild-type PR. Clusters of mutations exhibit both coordinated and antagonistic effects, suggesting PRS5B may represent an intermediate stage in the evolution of more highly resistant variants.

After the initial report that the major HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, gp120, can bind to 47, intensive research efforts have been focused on the role of 47 as a key factor in HIV-1 pathogenesis and as a potential target for prevention and treatment. The interaction between 47 and its natural ligand, MAdCAM-1, directs infected CD4+ T cells and HIV-1 virions carrying incorporated 47 to the gut mucosa, which may facilitate HIV-1 seeding and replication in the intestinal compartment during the early stages of infection. In addition, cells that express high levels of 47, such as Th17 cells, represent preferential targets for infection, and their frequency in the circulation was shown to correlate with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and disease progression. A number of in vivo studies in nonhuman primates have investigated whether blockage of 47 may affect SIV transmission and pathogenesis. Administration of a primatized anti-47 antibody that blocks MAdCAM-1 binding to 47 was reported to reduce SIV mucosal transmission in rhesus macaques. However, the mechanism responsible for such a protective effect is still undefined, and conflicting results have been reported on the effects of the same antibody, in combination with ART, during the early chronic phase of SIV infection. Thus, despite a series of tantalizing results accrued over the past decade, the jury is still out on the role of 47 in HIV-1 infection.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/JLB.4MR0120-208R;6.7;7.4;7.3;07415400;;;;

The Hologic Panther system uses 0.7 mL total volume for the Aptima HIV-1 Quant Assay standard (APT-Quant-std) and dilution (APT-Quant-dil) protocols. However, smaller plasma volumes from fingerstick whole blood (FSB) collected in EDTA-microtainer tubes (MCT) could provide an easier sample collection method for HIV-1 VL testing. Objectives: To evaluate the performance of the APT-Quant-std compared to the Roche CAP/CTM and Abbott m2000RT VL assays and an alternative APTQuant 1:7 dilution protocol, the latter using 100 L of MCT-derived plasma from FSB. Study design: Linearity was determined using commercial HIV-1 RNA plasma controls. Dilutions ranging 1.56–2.95 log10 copies/mL were prepared to determine the APT-Quant-dil Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) using Probit analysis. Specificity of APT-Quant-std was calculated using 326 HIVnegative samples. To evaluate agreement, 329 plasma specimens were tested with APT-Quant-std, CAP/CTM, and m2000RT. Forty-seven matched venipuncture and MCT-derived plasma specimens were tested with APT-Quant-std and APT-Quant-dil. Results: Among the RNA controls, specificity was 99.69 % for APT-Quant-std. The R2 values were 0.988 (APT-Quant-std/CAP/CTM), 0.980 (APT-Quant-std/ m2000RT), and 0.997 (APT-Quant-std/APT-Quant-dil). The APT-Quant-dil LOQ was estimated at 2.7 log10 copies/mL (500 copies/mL) (95 %CI 2.62–2.87). At 2.3 log10 copies/mL (200 copies/mL), the overall agreement was 91.0 % for APT-Quant-std/CAP/CTM, 85.7 % for APT-Quant-std/m2000RT, and 82.9 % for APT-Quant-std/APT-Quant-dil. Quantified APT-Quant-std results were on average 0.2 log10 copies/mL higher than CAP/CTM and m2000RT and 0.14 log10 copies/mL higher than APT-Quant-dil. Conclusion: APT-Quant showed similar performance compared to the CAP/CTM and m2000RT assays and remains sensitive and accurate using the dilution protocol.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1386653220302213;5.7;6.0;5.9;13866532;S1386653220302213;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1386653220302213;;

We found that EBV, which transforms B cells, renders them susceptible to HIV-1 infection in a CXCR4 and CD4-dependent manner in vitro and that CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 integrates into the genome of these B cells with the same molecular profile as in autologous CD4+ T cells. In addition, we established a humanized mouse model to investigate the in vivo interactions of EBV and HIV-1 upon coinfection. The respective mice that reconstitute human immune system components upon transplantation with CD34+ human hematopoietic progenitor cells could recapitulate aspects of EBV and HIV immunobiology observed in dual-infected patients. Upon coinfection of humanized mice, EBV/HIV dual-infected B cells could be detected, but were susceptible to CD8+ T-cell-mediated immune control.;https://www.life-science-alliance.org/lookup/doi/10.26508/lsa.202000640;0;0.3;1.4;;;;;

However, viral reservoirs persist by mechanisms, including the inhibition of autophagy by HIV-1 proteins (i.e., Nef and Tat). HIV-1 reservoirs can be targeted by the “shock and kill” strategy, which utilizes latency-reversing agents (LRAs) to activate latent proviruses and immunotarget the virus-producing cells. Yet, limitations include reduced LRA permeability across anatomical barriers and immune hyper-activation. Ionizing radiation (IR) induces effective viral activation across anatomical barriers. Like other LRAs, IR may cause inflammation and modulate the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). We and others have shown that cells may secrete cytokines and viral proteins in EVs and, therefore, LRAs may contribute to inflammatory EVs. In the present study, we mitigated the effects of IR-induced inflammatory EVs (i.e., TNF-), through the use of mTOR inhibitors (mTORi; Rapamycin and INK128). Further, mTORi were found to enhance the selective killing of HIV-1-infected myeloid and T-cell reservoirs at the exclusion of uninfected cells, potentially via inhibition of viral transcription/translation and induction of autophagy. Collectively, the proposed regimen using cART, IR, and mTORi presents a novel approach allowing for the targeting of viral reservoirs, prevention of immune hyper-activation, and selectively killing latently infected HIV-1 cells.";https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/8/885;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

The aim of this study was the synthesis and evaluation of in vitro antiHIV1 activity for phosphate derivatives of 3carboxyacylbetulin 3–5 as well as an in silico study of new compounds as potential ligands of the Cterminal domain of the HIV1 capsid–spacer peptide 1 (CACTDSP1) as a molecular target of HIV1 maturation inhibitors. In vitro studies showed that 28diethoxyphosphoryl3O(3,3di-methylsuccinyl)betulin (compound 3), the phosphate analog of bevirimat (betulinic acid derivative, HIV1 maturation inhibitor), has IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) equal to 0.02 M. Compound 3 inhibits viral replication at a level comparable to bevirimat and is also more selective (selectivity indices = 1250 and 967, respectively). Molecular docking was used to examine the prob-able interaction between the phosphate derivatives of 3carboxyacylbetulin and Cterminal domain (CTD) of the HIV1 capsid (CA)–spacer peptide 1 (SP1) fragment of Gag protein, designated as CTD SP1. Compared with interactions between bevirimat (BVM) and the protein, an increased number of strong interactions between ligand 3 and the protein, generated by the phosphate group, were observed. These compounds might have the potential to also inhibit SARSCoV2 proteins, in as far as the intrinsically imprecise docking scores suggest.;https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/8/1148;8.8;8.5;2.3;;;;;

All Rights Reserved.We recently reported a group of lipopeptide-based membrane fusion inhibitors with potent antiviral activities against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). In this study, the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of such a lipopeptide, LP-52, was evaluated in rhesus macaques chronically infected with pathogenic SIVmac239. In a pilot study with one monkey, monotherapy with low-dose LP-52 rapidly reduced the plasma viral loads to below the limit of detection and maintained viral suppression during three rounds of structurally interrupted treatment. The therapeutic efficacy of LP-52 was further verified in four infected monkeys; however, three out of the monkeys had viral rebounds under the LP-52 therapy. We next focused on characterizing SIV mutants responsible for the in vivo resistance. Sequence analyses revealed that a V562A or V562M mutation in the N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) and a E657G mutation in the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) of SIV gp41 conferred high resistance to LP-52 and cross-resistance to the peptide drug T20 and two newly designed lipopeptides (LP-80 and LP-83). Moreover, we showed that the resistance mutations greatly reduced the stability of diverse fusion inhibitors with the NHR site, and V562A or V562M in combination with E657G could significantly impair the functionality of viral envelopes (Envs) to mediate SIVmac239 infection and decrease the thermostability of viral six-helical bundle (6-HB) core structure. In conclusion, the present data have not only facilitated the development of novel anti-HIV drugs that target the membrane fusion step, but also help our understanding of the mechanism of viral evolution to develop drug resistance. IMPORTANCE The anti-HIV peptide drug T20 (enfuvirtide) is the only membrane fusion inhibitor available for treatment of viral infection; however, it exhibits relatively weak antiviral activity, short half-life, and a low genetic barrier to inducing drug resistance. Design of lipopeptide-based fusion inhibitors with extremely potent and broad antiviral activities against divergent HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV isolates have provided drug candidates for clinical development. Here, we have verified a high therapeutic efficacy for the lipopeptide LP-52 in SIVmac239-infected rhesus monkeys. The resistance mutations selected in vivo have also been characterized, providing insights into the mechanism of action of newly designed fusion inhibitors with a membrane-anchoring property. For the first time, the data show that HIV-1 and SIV can share a similar genetic pathway to develop resistance, and that a lipopeptide fusion inhibitor could have a same resistance profile as its template peptide.";https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/15/e00384-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

We hypothesized that a reservoir of HIV-infected cells actively produce and release virions during ART that are potentially infectious, and that following ART-interruption, these virions can complete full-cycles of replication and contribute to rebound viremia. Therefore, we studied the dynamics of RV sequence variants in 3 participants who initiated ART after ~3 years of infection and were ART-suppressed for >6 years prior to self-initiated ART-interruptions. Longitudinal RV C2V5env sequences were compared to sequences from pre-ART plasma, supernatants of quantitative viral outgrowth assays (QVOA) of cells collected during ART, post-ART-interruption plasma, and ART-re-suppression plasma. Identical, “putatively clonal,” RV sequences comprised 8–84% of sequences from each timepoint. The majority of RV sequences were genetically similar to those from plasma collected just prior to ART-initiation, but as the duration of ART-suppression increased, an increasing proportion of RV variants were similar to sequences from earlier in infection. Identical sequences were detected in RV over a median of 3 years (range: 0.3–8.2) of ART-suppression. RV sequences were identical to pre-ART plasma viruses (5%), infectious viruses induced in QVOA (4%) and rebound viruses (5%) (total n = 21/154 (14%) across the 3 participants). RV sequences identical to ART-interruption “rebound” sequences were detected 0.1–7.4 years prior to ART-interruption. RV variant prevalence and persistence were not associated with detection of the variant among rebound sequences. Shortly after ART-re-suppression, variants that had been replicating during ART-interruptions were detected as RV (n = 5). These studies show a dynamic, virion-producing HIV reservoir that contributes to rekindling infection upon ART-interruption. The persistence of identical RV variants over years suggests that a subpopulation of HIV-infected clones frequently or continuously produce virions that may resist immune clearance; this suggests that cure strategies should target this active as well as latent reservoirs.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008791;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

They play a crucial role in immunity but also in regeneration and homeostasis. Their remarkable plasticity in their phenotypes and function provides them with the ability to quickly respond to environmental changes and infection. Recent work shows that macrophages undergo cell cycle transition from a G0/terminally differentiated state to a G1 state. This G0-to-G1 transition presents a window of opportunity for HIV-1 infection. Macrophages are an important target for HIV-1 but express high levels of the deoxynucleotide-triphosphate hydrolase SAMHD1, which restricts viral DNA synthesis by decreasing levels of dNTPs. While the G0 state is non-permissive to HIV-1 infection, a G1 state is very permissive to HIV-1 infection. This is because macrophages in a G1 state switch off the antiviral restriction factor SAMHD1 by phosphorylation, thereby allowing productive HIV-1 infection. Here, we explore the macrophage cell cycle and the interplay between its regulation and permissivity to HIV-1 infection.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/8/839;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

Considered to be only a scaffolding protein for a long time, the structural protein Gag plays determinate and specific roles in HIV-1 replication. Indeed, via its different domains, Gag orchestrates the specific encapsidation of the genomic RNA, drives the formation of the viral particle by its auto-assembly (multimerization), binds multiple viral proteins, and interacts with a large number of cellular proteins that are needed for its functions from its translation location to the plasma membrane, where newly formed virions are released. Here, we review the interactions between HIV-1 Gag and 66 cellular proteins. Notably, we describe the techniques used to evidence these interactions, the different domains of Gag involved, and the implications of these interactions in the HIV-1 replication cycle. In the final part, we focus on the interactions involving the highly conserved nucleocapsid (NC) domain of Gag and detail the functions of the NC interactants along the viral lifecycle.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/8/888;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

Understanding the prevalence and patterns of HIVDR in this population (15-24 years) will contribute to defining effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, improving clinical decision making, and supporting behavioral change interventions needed to achieve HIV epidemic control. Methods A cross-sectional analysis of study enrollment data from the Project YES! Youth Engaging for Success randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants were 15 to 24 years old, who knew their HIV status, and had been on ART for at least 6 months. All participants completed a survey and underwent viral load (VL) testing. Participants with viral failure (VL 1,000 copies/mL) underwent HIVDR testing which included analysis of mutations in the protease and reverse transcriptase genes. Results A total of 99 out of 273 analyzed participants receiving ART had VL failure, of whom 77 had successful HIVDR amplification and analysis. Out of the 77, 75% (58) had at least one drug resistant mutation, among which 83% (48/58) required a drug change. Among the 58 with HIVDR mutations, the prevalence of at least one HIVDR mutation to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) were 81%, 65.5% and 1.7%. The mutation M184V which confers resistance to NRTI drugs of lamivudine (3TC) and emtricitabine (FTC) was the most common (81%) among NRTI associated mutations followed by K65R (34.5%) which is associated with both tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) resistance. Thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs) which confer resistance primarily to zidovudine (AZT), stavudine (d4T) and other NRTIs were observed at 32.8%. Common TAMs were K70RTQNE (32.8%), K219QE (22.4%), D67N (17.2%) and T215IT (15.5%). The most common NNRTI associated mutation was the K103N (65.5%) which confers resistance to both efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP). There was a relatively high occurrence of other NNRTI mutations V106A (36.2%), as well as Y188C (36.2%) and Y181C (36.2%) which confer resistance to etravirine. Conclusions There is a high prevalence of HIVDR including TAMs despite majority of these patients (90.48%) being on AZT or d4T sparing first line ART among the youth. Emergence of these mutations including the NNRTI associated mutations (Y181C and Y188C) may compromise future second- and third-line regimens in the absence of routine HIVDR testing. HIVDR monitoring at start of ART or at first-line failure can better inform clinical decision making and ART programing.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236156;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has become an efficient tool to eradicate HIV-1 genome or prevent replication. Furthermore, regulation of Cas9 gene expression by HIV can induce mutations that could inactivate the proviral genome, making a gene therapy safe by preventing the induction of non-specific mutations, which could compromise the integrity of healthy cells. In this study, isolated HIV-1 LTR, INS and RRE sequences were used to regulate Cas9 expression in HEK293 cells, and guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed to target mutations in HIV-1 conserved regions such as tat and rev regulatory genes. We demonstrate that Cas9 expression in our system is controlled by the HIV-1 Tat and Rev proteins, leading to self-regulation of gene edition, and showing a strong antiviral effect by inactivating HIV-1 replication. Sequencing analysis confirmed that viral genome was partially excised by multiplex editing (90% efficiency), and viral capsid protein (CA-p24) was undetectable. In conclusion, the self-regulated CRISPR/Cas9 system may be a reliable and accurate strategy for eliminating HIV-1 infection whose effect will be restricted to infected cells.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166354220302709;7.4;7.3;7.4;01663542;S0166354220302709;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0166354220302709;;

Allogeneic stem cell transplantations (SCT) with or without donor cells harboring genetic mutations preventing functional expression of CCR5, an HIV coreceptor, lead to dramatic reductions in residual HIV burden. However, the mechanisms by which SCT reduces viral reservoirs and leads to a potential functional HIV cure are not well understood. Recent Findings: A growing number of studies involving allogeneic SCT in people with HIV are emerging, including those with and without transplants involving CCR532/32 mutations. Donor cells resistant to HIV entry are likely required in order to achieve permanent ART-free viral remission. However, dramatic reductions in the HIV reservoir secondary to beneficial graft-versus-host effects may lead to loss of HIV detection in blood and various tissues and lead to prolonged time to HIV rebound in individuals with wild-type CCR5 donors. Studies of SCT recipients and those who started very early ART during hyperacute infection suggest that dramatic reductions in reservoir size or restriction of initial reservoir seeding may lead to 8–10 months of time prior to eventual, and rapid, HIV recrudescence. Summary: Studies of allogeneic SCT in people with HIV have provided important insights into the size and nature of the HIV reservoir, and have invigorated other gene therapies to achieve HIV cure.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11904-020-00505-2;10.3;0;6.5;15483568;;;;

This makes the continuous study of HIV drug resistance and new treatment options pertinent to patients and researchers globally. The aim of this study is to analyze the complete HIV-1 integrase gene for the possible occurrence of resistance mutations or polymorphisms. We performed genetic analyses on 48 treatment-naive HIV-1-infected patients using nested polymerase chain reaction. Integrase drug-related resistance mutation (DRMs) analysis was performed on all generated sequences according to Stanford HIV drug interpretation program and the International AIDS Society-USA guidelines while phylogenetic analysis was inferred using MEGA 6. The study revealed no major resistance-associated mutation. However, E157Q (2.1%), L74M/I (4.2%), and P142T (2.1%) were the observed accessory and polymorphic mutations. Naturally occurring polymorphism observed were E11D, K14R, D25E, V31I, M50I, V72I, P90T, F100Y, L101I, T124A, T125A, K136Q, D167E, V201I, L234I, A265V, A269K, D278A, and S283G. Phylogenetic analysis delineated all the sequences as HIV-1 subtype C. The study revealed the absence of major integrase inhibitors associated resistance mutations in a setting where integrase inhibitor is administered as salvage therapy in patients developing resistance to first and second-line antiretroviral treatment. However minor and natural polymorphisms were observed and thus may influence the outcome of each treatment regimen. However, additional studies are required to precisely evaluate the impact of these mutations on integrase inhibitors in the Eastern Cape of South Africa.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25661;3.8;3.9;4.0;01466615;;;;

Hence, this study aims to determine the magnitude of hypertension and its associated factors among HIV-positive patients receiving care at referral hospitals of Northwest Ethiopia Materials and methods A cross-sectional study design was conducted to determine the burden of hypertension in patients living with HIV receiving care at referral hospitals of Northwest Ethiopia between November 2018 and May 2019. Four hundred seven randomly selected adult patients were included for the study. Using standardized questionnaire, sociodemographic, behavioral and clinical data were collected. Anthropometric parameters, fasting blood sugar as well as lipid profiles were determined. Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed. Result A total of 407 study subjects with 98% response rate have been included in this study. The prevalence of hypertension was 14.0% (95% CI: 10.63,17.37). Elementary educational status as compared to no education [AOR (95% CI) 2.75 (1.12,6.75), p< 0.05], moderate monthly income compared to low [AOR (95% CI) 4.27 (2.09,8.73), p<0.01], waist circumference [AOR (95% CI) 4.27 (2.09,8.73), p<0.01], taking concomitant other drug therapy [AOR (95% CI) 5.72 (2.25,14.54), p<0.01] and duration of antiretroviral therapy [AOR (95% CI) 1.12 (1.04,1.20) were significantly associated with hypertension. Conclusion Hypertension is not uncommon in patients living with HIV. Educational status, monthly income, waist circumference, concomitant drug therapy and duration of antiretroviral therapy are linked with hypertension. The finding pinpoints that health care providers should work up on risk factors to reduce the burden of hypertension among the patients.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238114;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

Western Sydney has a culturally diverse population, with a high proportion of non-Australian-born individuals. This study describes the prevalence of TDR and non-B HIV-1 subtypes in a clinic-based population. Methods: A clinic database was examined for all newly diagnosed treatment-naïve HIV-1 patients and information on their HIV-1 resistance and subtype, demographics including country of birth and diagnosis of a bacterial sexually transmissible infection was collected. Results: Data were available from 74/79 individuals (62 cis-male, 16 cis-female and 1 transgender woman). Of the 74 genotypes, the prevalence of non-B subtypes and TDR was 43/74 (58%; 95%CI = 46.9-69.3) and 14/74 (19%; 95%CI = 10.0 to 27.8). It was also found that 30/79 (38%) had a concurrent bacterial STI. TDR was associated with subtype B infection (OR 3.53; 95%CI = 1.41-8.82; P = 0.007) and being born in Australia (OR 12.0; 95%CI = 2.45-58.86; P = 0.002). Conclusion: The relative prevalence of non-B HIV-1 subtypes and TDR is higher in Western Sydney than in the rest of Australia. TDR is associated with subtype B HIV-1 and being Australian born, suggesting ongoing local transmission. This highlights the diversity of the HIV epidemic locally and the need for interventions to prevent ongoing HIV transmission.";http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=SH20013;2.7;2.3;2.7;14485028;;;;

With limited access to clinical specimens, animal models could advance our understanding of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) disease and viral persistence. Here, we summarize current findings on HIV-1 CNS infection from nonhuman primate (NHP) models and discuss their implications for improving pediatric clinical outcomes. Recent Findings: SIV/SHIV can be found in the CNS of infant macaques within 48 h of challenge. Recent studies show an impermeable BBB during SIV infection, suggesting neuroinvasion in post-partum infection is likely not wholly attributed to barrier dysfunction. Histopathological findings reveal dramatic reductions in hippocampal neuronal populations and myelination in infected infant macaques, providing a link for cognitive impairments seen in pediatric cases. Evidence from humans and NHPs support the CNS as a functional latent reservoir, harbored in myeloid cells that may require unique eradication strategies. Summary: Studies in NHP models are uncovering early events, causes, and therapeutic targets of CNS disease as well as highlighting the importance of age-specific studies that capture the distinct features of pediatric HIV-1 infection.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11904-020-00503-4;10.3;0;6.5;15483568;;;;

The aim of this study was to evaluate the CCR5-32 mutation among individuals with high-risk behaviors, neonates born to HIV-1-infected mothers in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) project, HIV-1-infected individuals, and healthy people. The frequency of the CCR5-32 genotype was assessed in a cross-sectional survey carried out from March 2014 to March 2019 among four different groups of the Iranian population. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 140 Iranian healthy people, 84 neonates born to HIV-1-infected mothers in the PMTCT project, 71 people with high-risk behaviors, and 76 HIV-1-infected individuals. The polymerase chain reaction method was used for the amplification of the CCR5 gene. The CCR5-32 heterozygous deletion was detected in five (6.6%) HIV-1-infected individuals, four (4.7%) neonates born to HIV-1 positive mothers, two (1.4%) healthy people, and also three (4.2%) people with high-risk behaviors whereas the CCR5-32 homozygous deletion was absent in all the groups (Fisher's exact test, P =.0242). The allele of CCR5-32 homozygous was not detected in the four study groups, and no significant difference was seen in the frequency of the CCR532 heterozygous allele between HIV seropositive and seronegative individuals. Therefore, it seems that this allele alone cannot explain the natural resistance to HIV-1 infection and probably several mechanisms are responsible for these processes and it should be further investigated.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25658;3.8;3.9;4.0;01466615;;;;

To identify the key amino acid recognition site contacted with neutralizing antibody Y498, peptides were panned from the PhD-12 peptide library and predicted using online software. Then, four key amino acid sites, G367, D368, E370, and V372 located on the CD4 binding loop on gp120 of envelope of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), were found to determine the neutralization of antibody Y498. Residue E370 is in the deep part of the CD4 binding loop, which affects Y498-mediated neutralization. This form of recognition leads to a somewhat limiting neutralization spectrum of neutralizing antibody Y498, although it has some neutralization ability. Further study of the interactions between the neutralizing antibody Y498 and its epitope on the surface of the virus may facilitate vaccine development and so prevent new AIDS cases.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168170219308901;5.1;4.9;5.3;01681702;S0168170219308901;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0168170219308901;;

All Rights Reserved.Infection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is subject to restriction by cellular factors. Serine incorporator 5 (SERINC5) and interferon-inducible transmembrane 3 (IFITM3) proteins represent two of these restriction factors, which inhibit HIV-1 entry into target cells. Both proteins impede fusion of the viral membrane with the cellular membrane and the formation of a viral fusion pore, and both are countered by the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env). Given the immense and lasting pressure which Env endures from host adaptive immune responses, it is important to understand whether and how HIV-1 Env is able to maintain the resistance to SERINC5 and IFITM3 throughout the course of infection. We have thus examined a panel of HIV-1 Env clones that were isolated at different stages of viral infection—transmission, acute, and chronic. While HIV-1 Env clones from the transmission stage are resistant to both SERINC5 and IFITM3, as infection progresses into the acute and chronic stages, the resistance to IFITM3 but not to SERINC5 is gradually lost. We further discovered a significant correlation between the resistance of HIV-1 Env to soluble CD4 inhibition and the resistance to SERINC5 but not to IFITM3. Interestingly, the miniprotein CD4 mimetic M48U1 sensitizes HIV-1 Env to the inhibition by SERINC5 but not IFITM3. Together, these data indicate that SERINC5 and IFITM3 exert differential inhibitory pressures on HIV-1 Env over different stages of HIV-1 infection and that HIV-1 Env uses varied strategies to resist these two restriction factors. IMPORTANCE HIV-1 Env protein is exposed to the inhibition not only by humoral response, but also by host restriction factors, including serine incorporator 5 (SERINC5) and interferon-inducible transmembrane 3 (IFITM3). This study investigates how HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) manages to overcome the pressures from all these different host inhibition mechanisms over the long course of viral infection. HIV-1 Env preserves the resistance to SERINC5 but becomes sensitive to IFITM3 when infection progresses into the chronic stage. Our study also supports the possibility of using CD4 mimetic compounds to sensitize HIV-1 Env to the inhibition by SERINC5 as a potential therapeutic strategy.;None;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

Objective: We evaluated the diagnostic performance of the Alinity m HIV-1 assay, which uses a dual target/dual probe design against highly conserved target regions of the HIV-1 genome and is run on the fully automated Alinity m platform. Study design: This was an international, multisite study that compared the diagnostic performance of the Alinity m HIV-1 assay to four commercially available HIV-1 assays routinely used in nine independent clinical laboratories. Alinity m HIV-1 assay precision, detectability, and reproducibility was compared across four study sites. Results: The Alinity m HIV-1 assay produced comparable results to currently available HIV-1 assays (correlation coefficient >0.995), with an overall bias of -0.1 to 0.10 Log10 copies/mL. The Alinity m HIV-1 assay and its predecessor m2000 HIV-1 assay demonstrated comparable detection of 16 different HIV-1 subtypes (R2 = 0.956). A high level of agreement (>88 %) between all HIV-1 assays was seen near clinical decision points of 1.7 Log10 copies/mL (50 copies/mL) and 2.0 Log10 copies/mL (200 copies/mL). Alinity m HIV-1 assay precision was 0.08 and 0.21 Log10 copies/mL at VLs of 1000 and 50 copies/mL, respectively, with a high level of detectability (97 % hit rate) and reproducibility across sites. Conclusions: The Alinity m HIV-1 assay provides comparable diagnostic accuracy to current HIV-1 assays, and when run on the Alinity m system, has the capacity to shorten the time between diagnosis and treatment.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1386653220302729;5.7;6.0;5.9;13866532;S1386653220302729;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1386653220302729;;

Stopping therapy typically leads to the reignition of infection and progressive disease. In a major breakthrough, recent studies have shown that early initiation of ART can lead to sustained post-treatment control of viremia, raising hopes of long-term HIV-1 remission. ART, however, elicits post-treatment control in a small fraction of individuals treated. Strikingly, passive immunization with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) of HIV-1 early in infection was found recently to elicit long-term control in a majority of SHIV-infected macaques, suggesting that HIV-1 remission may be more widely achievable. The mechanisms underlying the control elicited by bNAb therapy, however, remain unclear. Untreated infection typically leads to progressive disease. We hypothesized that viremic control represents an alternative but rarely realized outcome of the infection and that early bNAb therapy triggers a dynamical switch to this outcome. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a model of viral dynamics with bNAb therapy and applied it to analyse clinical data. The model fit quantitatively the complex longitudinal viral load data from macaques that achieved lasting control. The model predicted, consistently with our hypothesis, that the underlying system exhibited bistability, indicating two potential outcomes of infection. The first had high viremia, weak cytotoxic effector responses, and high effector exhaustion, marking progressive disease. The second had low viremia, strong effector responses, and low effector exhaustion, indicating lasting viremic control. Further, model predictions suggest that early bNAb therapy elicited lasting control via pleiotropic effects. bNAb therapy lowers viremia, which would also limit immune exhaustion. Simultaneously, it can improve effector stimulation via cross-presentation. Consequently, viremia may resurge post-therapy, but would encounter a primed effector population and eventually get controlled. ART suppresses viremia but does not enhance effector stimulation, explaining its limited ability to elicit post-treatment control relative to bNAb therapy.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008064;7.8;7.2;7.3;;;;;

All rights reserved.Sterile  motif and histidine/aspartic acid domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) can inhibit reverse transcription of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) by hydrolyzing intracellular deoxy-ribonucleoside triphosphate. However, its role in HIV-1 disease progression has not been extensively studied. To study the impacts of SAMHD1 on HIV-1 disease progression, especially on DNA levels, we investigated SAMHD1 levels in the peripheral blood of HIV-1 elite controllers (ECs), antiretroviral therapy (AR T) naive viremic progressors (VPs) and patients with HIV-1 receiving ART (HIV-ARTs) compared with healthy controls. In addition, the present study analyzed the relationship between SAMHD1 and interferon-, immune activation and HIV-1 DNA levels. The results of the present study demonstrated elevated SAMHD1 expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of all patients withHIV-1, but higher SAMHD1 expression in the CD4+ T cells of only ECs compared with healthy controls. Immune activation was increased in the VPs and decreased in the EC s compared with healthy controls. Substantially lower HIV-1 DNA levels were identified in EC s compared with those in VPs and HIV-ARTs. SAMHD1 expression was associated with low levels of immune activation. No significant correlation was observed between SAMHD1 and HIV-1 DNA levels. Overall, the findings of the present study indicated that SAMHD1 was highly expressed in ECs, which may be associated with low immune activation levels, but was not directly related to HIV-1 DNA levels.;http://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2020.11153;2.8;3.3;3.6;17912997;;;;

Unsafe heterosexual activity prevailed in migrants born in Africa and male homosexuality in those born in European, American and Asian countries (p = 0.05). The phylogeny showed that 38/77 (49.3%) subjects carried HIV-B subtype while the remaining strains were classified as not pure HIV-1 B subtypes 13/77 (16.9%) or recombinant forms 26/77 (33.8%). Female gender more frequently showed HIV-1 non-B strains and rarely HIV-1 B subtypes (12/39, 30.8% vs. 3/38, 7.9%, p = 0.02).

Here, we found a common YxxØ-motif of multiple viruses that exploits host AP2M1 for intracellular trafficking. A library chemical, N-(p-amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid (ACA), was identified to interrupt AP2M1-virus interaction and exhibit potent antiviral efficacy against a number of viruses in vitro and in vivo, including the influenza A viruses (IAVs), Zika virus (ZIKV), human immunodeficiency virus, and coronaviruses including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. YxxØ mutation, AP2M1 depletion, or disruption by ACA causes incorrect localization of viral proteins, which is exemplified by the failure of nuclear import of IAV nucleoprotein and diminished endoplasmic reticulum localization of ZIKV-NS3 and enterovirus-A71-2C proteins, thereby suppressing viral replication. Our study reveals an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of protein-protein interaction between host and virus that can serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral target.;https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aba7910;9.6;15.0;25.2;;;;;

The B-NSG (NOD-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1/Bcge) mice that have severe immune defect phenotype are examined for the suitability of such a model in this study. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were engrafted into B-NSG mice via mouse tail vein injection, and the repopulated human T-lymphocytes were observed at as early as 3-weeks post-transplantation in mouse peripheral blood and several tissues. The humanized mice could be infected by HIV-1, and the infection recapitulated features of T-lymphocyte dynamic observed in HIV-1 infected humans, meanwhile the administration of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) suppressed viral replication and restored T lymphocyte abnormalities. The establishment of HIV-1 infected humanized B-NSG mice not only provides a model to study virus and T cell interplays, but also can be a useful tool to evaluate antiviral strategies.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12250-019-00181-6;2.8;3.0;3.4;16740769;;;;

A survey was administered to participants who were: 18 years old, living with HIV, and receiving antiretroviral therapy. Surveys included demographics, adherence questionnaire, and a validated HIV-stigma scale with DS as the sum of 10 items ranked 0–3, with score of 30 indicating highest stigma. The primary outcome was lack of virologic suppression (LOVS): most recent HIV-1 RNA > 20 copies/ml. A bivariate analyses examined predictors of DS, dichotomized at the median. Depression score, perceived stress, and lack of friend/family support were associated with DS. Logistic regression models examined the relationship between DS, as a continuous variable, and LOVS. For 275 participants (69% Hispanic), median DS score was 18.5. DS was significantly inversely associated with LOVS (aOR 0.94 per 1 scale point; CI 0.89, 0.99) after adjustment for age, gender/sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and drug use. The unanticipated inverse association between DS and LOVS highlights the complexity of this relationship.

Young adults with recent HIV acquisition frequently seek care for symptoms and could potentially be diagnosed through the health care system. Early recognition of HIV infection provides considerable individual and public health benefits, including linkage to treatment as prevention, access to risk reduction counseling and treatment, and notification of partners in need of HIV testing. Objective: The Tambua Mapema Plus study aims to (1) test 1500 young adults (aged 18-39 years) identified by an AHI screening algorithm for acute and prevalent (ie, seropositive) HIV, linking all newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients to care and offering immediate treatment; (2) offer assisted HIV partner notification services to all patients with HIV, testing partners for acute and prevalent HIV infection and identifying local sexual networks; and (3) model the potential impact of these two interventions on the Kenyan HIV epidemic, estimating incremental costs per HIV infection averted, death averted, and disability-adjusted life year averted using data on study outcomes. Methods: A modified stepped-wedge design is evaluating the yield of this HIV testing intervention at 4 public and 2 private health facilities in coastal Kenya before and after intervention delivery. The intervention uses point-of-care HIV-1 RNA testing combined with standard rapid antibody tests to diagnose AHI and prevalent HIV among young adults presenting for care, employs HIV partner notification services to identify linked acute and prevalent infections, and follows all newly diagnosed patients and their partners for 12 months to ascertain clinical outcomes, including linkage to care, antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and virologic suppression in HIV-infected patients, and pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake in uninfected individuals in discordant partnerships. Results: Enrollment started in December 2017. As of April 2020, 1374 participants have been enrolled in the observation period and 1500 participants have been enrolled in the intervention period, with 13 new diagnoses (0.95%) in the observation period and 37 new diagnoses (2.47%), including 2 AHI diagnoses, in the intervention period. Analysis is ongoing and will include adjusted comparisons of the odds of the following outcomes in the observation and intervention periods: being tested for HIV infection, newly diagnosed with prevalent or acute HIV infection, linked to care, and starting ART by week 6 following HIV diagnosis. Participants newly diagnosed with acute or prevalent HIV infection in the intervention period are being followed for outcomes, including viral suppression by month 6 and month 12 following ART initiation and partner testing outcomes. Conclusions: The Tambua Mapema Plus study will provide foundational data on the potential of this novel combination HIV prevention intervention to reduce ongoing HIV transmission in Kenya and other high-prevalence African settings.";https://www.researchprotocols.org/2020/8/e16198;0;0;0;;;;;

Discrepant results can result from two scenarios: a false-positive screening test or acute HIV infection. These scenarios can be distinguished by a molecular HIV test, but due to contamination concerns, our laboratory recently implemented a policy requiring a second specimen dedicated for molecular HIV testing. Our objective was to (1) characterize the effect of this policy on the time-to-diagnosis for patients with discrepant screening and supplemental test results, and (2) explore ""strength of positivity""as an interim predictor of screening test accuracy while awaiting confirmatory test results. Methods Data from our laboratory information system, electronic health record, and instrument logs were used to collate data for all HIV testing performed at Barnes-Jewish Hospital (BJH) between January 1, 2014 and October 18, 2017. Results Requiring a dedicated specimen for molecular testing significantly increased the time-to-diagnosis for patients with discrepant screening and supplemental HIV tests (p = 0.0084). This policy also contributed to loss-to-followup, with 0/35 discrepant cases lost-to-followup prior to policy implementation compared to 2/10 after implementation. However, by optimizing the signal-tocutoff (S/CO) ratio of the screening test, we were able to more accurately distinguish false-positives from acute-HIV prior to molecular testing (sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 89%). Conclusions We propose utilizing quantitative fourth-generation assay results (S/CO) ratios as a predictor of infection true positivity in situations where the screening assay is reactive but the supplemental test is negative and confirmatory molecular results are not immediately available.

The objective was to describe the 5-years outcomes among HIV-2 patients harboring drug-resistant viruses. Methods A clinic-based cohort of HIV-2-patients experiencing virologic failure, with at least one drug resistance mutation was followed from January 2012 to August 2017 in Côte d'Ivoire. Follow-up data included death, lost to follow-up (LTFU), immuno-virological responses. The Kaplan-Meier curve was used to estimate survival rates. Results A total of 31 HIV-2 patients with virologic failure and with at least one drug resistance mutation were included. Two-third of them were men, 28(90.3%) were on PI-based ART-regimen at enrolment and the median age was 50 years (IQR = 46 54). The median baseline CD4 count and viral load were 456 cells/mm3 and 3.7 log10 c/mL respectively, and the participants have been followed-up in median 57 months (IQR = 24 60). During this period, 21 (67.7%) patients switched at least one antiretroviral drug, including two (6.5%) and three (9.7%) who switched to a PI-based and an integrase inhibitor-based regimen respectively. A total of 10(32.3%) patients died and 4(12.9%) were LTFU. The 36 and 60-months survival rates were 68.5% and 64.9%, respectively. Among the 17 patients remaining in care, six (35.3%) had an undetectable viral load (<50 c/mL) and for the 11 others, the viral load ranged from 2.8 to 5.6 log10 c/mL. Twelve patients were receiving lopinavir at the time of first genotype, five(42%) had a genotypic susceptibility score (GSS) ?1 and 4(33%) a GSS >2. Conclusions The 36-months survival rate among ART-experienced HIV-2 patients with drug-resistant viruses is below 70%,lower than in HIV-1. There is urgent need to improve access to second-line ART for patients living with HIV-2 in West Africa.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236642;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Well-characterized unlinked donation samples classified as HIV negative, false positive, or confirmed positive were included in the study: 200 antibody-nonreactive, 200 HIV-1 immunofluorescence assay (IFA) confirmed-positive, and 100 antibody-screen false-positive donations, equally divided between serum and plasma. Samples were retrieved from a repository, relabeled, and tested by an immunochromatographic test (Geenius HIV 1/2 Supplemental Assay, Bio-Rad). Comparator testing involved parallel US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed HIV-1 IFA or HIV-2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) supplemental testing for any sample missing those results as part of routine testing (otherwise test-of-record results were used). Samples with discordant results were further tested with a rapid test (Multispot HIV-1/HIV-2 Rapid Test, Bio-Rad) to provide final sample interpretations. Testing volume reductions with the Geenius were estimated from screening performed by the American Red Cross from September 2016 to April 2019. RESULTS: Clinical results were 100% sensitivity and specificity with an indeterminate rate of 4.0% to 5.0%. From 2016 to 2019, sole use of the Geenius would reduce testing complexity for 5265 antibody repeat-reactive donations including 95.7% (5028) false positives, eliminating approximately 5000 unnecessary tests. CONCLUSION: Geenius FDA licensure (August 26, 2019) adding the HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation/confirmation donation supplemental claim will enable replacement of previously used FDA-licensed supplemental assays while maintaining comparable sensitivity, avoiding thousands of unnecessary HIV-1-IFA, western blot, and HIV-2-EIA tests.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/trf.15819;5.7;5.3;4.9;00411132;;;;

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may affect the risk of death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) differently in men versus women. Methods. We examined CVD mortality rates between 2007 and 2017 among all New York City residents living with HIV and aged 13+ by sex, using data from city HIV surveillance and vital statistics and the National Death Index. Residents without HIV were enumerated using modified US intercensal estimates. We determined associations of HIV status with CVD mortality by sex and neighborhood poverty, defined as the percent of residents living below the federal poverty level, after accounting for age, race/ ethnicity, and year. Results. There were 3234 CVD deaths reported among 147 915 New Yorkers living with HIV, with the proportion of deaths due to CVD increasing from 11% in 2007 to 22% in 2017. The age-standardized CVD mortality rate was 2.7/1000 person-years among both men and women with HIV. The relative rate of CVD mortality associated with HIV status was significantly higher among women (adjusted rate ratio [aRR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-1.8) than men (aRR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3) overall, and within strata defined by neighborhood poverty. Sex differences in CVD mortality rates were the greatest when comparing individuals living with HIV and having detectable HIV RNA and CD4+ T-cell counts <500 cells/uL with individuals living without HIV. Conclusions. Among people with HIV, 1 in 5 deaths is now associated with CVD. HIV providers should recognize the CVD risk among women with HIV, and reinforce preventive measures (eg, smoking cessation, blood pressure control, lipid management) and viremic control among people living with HIV regardless of neighborhood poverty to reduce CVD mortality.;https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/3/491/5555887;14.0;13.8;12.5;10584838;;;;

Materials and methods We studied the association between HIV subtypes and immunologic and virologic outcomes in a longitudinal cohort of 169 patients on combination antiretroviral therapy. Participants were followed up for 5 years. Demographic data, CD4 cell count and viral loads (VL) were extracted from medical records. Whole protease gene and codon 1–300 of the reverse transcriptase gene were sequenced and analysed. Results Sixty-four percent of participants were females with a median age of 35 years. Twelve different subtypes were observed, the commonest being CRF 02_AG (55.0%) and subtypes G (23.1%). All subtypes showed steady rise in CD4 count and there was no difference in proportion who achieved CD4+ cell count rise of 100 cells/L from baseline within 12 months’ post-initiation of ART, or 350 cells/L at 60 months’ post-initiation. Median time to attaining a rise of 350 cells/L was 24 months (6–48 months). The proportion that achieved undetectable VL at month 6 and 12 post-initiation of ART were comparable across subtypes. At end of 5th year, there was no statistical difference in proportion with virologic failure. Conclusion No association between HIV subtypes and immunologic or virologic response to therapy was observed, suggesting that current first-line ART may have similar efficacy across subtype predominating in South-West Nigeria.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238027;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

In this study, we have described the prevalence of INSTI DR in a Russian cohort and the genetic features of HIV-1 integrase sub-subtype A6. We included 408 HIV infected patients who were not exposed to INSTI. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were detected among 1.3% of ART-naïve patients and among 2.7% of INSTI-naïve patients. The prevalence of 12 polymorphic mutations was significantly different between sub-subtypes A6 and A1. Analysis of the genetic barriers determined two positions in which subtype A (A1 and A6) showed a higher genetic barrier (G140C and V151I) compared with subtype B, and one position in which subtypes A1 and B displayed a higher genetic barrier (L74M and L74I) than sub-subtype A6. Additionally, we confirmed that the L74I mutation was selected at the early stage of the epidemic and subsequently spread as a founder effect in Russia. Our data have added to the overall understanding of the genetic features of sub-subtype A6 in the context of drug resistance.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/8/838;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

We now report that MARCH8 also blocks the Ebola virus (EBOV) glycopro-tein (GP) incorporation via surface downregulation. To understand how these viral fusion proteins are downregulated, we investigated the effects of MARCH8 on EBOV GP maturation and externalization via the conventional secretion pathway. MARCH8 interacted with EBOV GP and furin when detected by immunoprecipitation and re-tained the GP/furin complex in the Golgi when their location was tracked by a bi-molecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. MARCH8 did not reduce the GP expression or affect the GP modification by high-mannose N-glycans in the en-doplasmic reticulum (ER), but it inhibited the formation of complex N-glycans on the GP in the Golgi. Additionally, the GP O-glycosylation and furin-mediated proteolytic cleavage were also inhibited. Moreover, we identified a novel furin cleavage site on EBOV GP and found that only those fully glycosylated GPs were processed by furin and incorporated into virions. Furthermore, the GP shedding and secretion were all blocked by MARCH8. MARCH8 also blocked the furin-mediated cleavage of HIV-1 Env (gp160) and the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA). We conclude that MARCH8 has a very broad antiviral activity by prohibiting different viral fusion proteins from glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage in the Golgi, which inhibits their transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane and incorporation into virions. IMPORTANCE Enveloped viruses express three classes of fusion proteins that are required for their entry into host cells via mediating virus and cell membrane fusion. Class I fusion proteins are produced from influenza viruses, retroviruses, Ebola vi-ruses, and coronaviruses. They are first synthesized as a type I transmembrane poly-peptide precursor that is subsequently glycosylated and oligomerized. Most of these precursors are cleaved en route to the plasma membrane by a cellular protease furin in the late secretory pathway, generating the trimeric N-terminal receptor-binding and C-terminal fusion subunits. Here, we show that a cellular protein, MARCH8, specifically inhibits the furin-mediated cleavage of EBOV GP, HIV-1 Env, and H5N1 HA. Further analyses uncovered that MARCH8 blocked the EBOV GP glycosylation in the Golgi and inhibited its transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Thus, MARCH8 has a very broad antiviral activity by specifically inactivating different viral fusion proteins.;https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/5/e01882-20;11.2;10.5;9.9;21612129;;;;

We evaluated the genotypic and phenotypic susceptibility to temsavir in a panel of samples collected from patients harbouring MDR strains enrolled in the Italian PRESTIGIO Registry. METHODS: Plasma samples from 24 patients were used for HIV-1 gp120 sequencing, while viral tropism and susceptibility to temsavir were assessed through a homemade phenotypic assay with pseudotyped viruses expressing patient-derived Env protein. RESULTS: Of the 24 patients enrolled, 18 (75%) were male, median (IQR) age was 55 years (52-61), time since HIV-1 diagnosis was 27 years (24-30), time on ART was 26 years (23-27) and 11 (46%) had a previous AIDS diagnosis. Exposure to entry inhibitors (maraviroc and/or enfuvirtide) had occurred in 19 (79%) patients. Among 23/24 gp120 sequences obtained, temsavir resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) were detected in three cases (two M426L and one S375N). Pseudotyped viruses were obtained from 23/24 samples and viral tropism was CXCR4-tropic, CCR5-tropic and dual/mixed-tropic in six, nine and eight cases, respectively. Phenotypic susceptibility to temsavir was comparable to the reference WT viruses NL4-3 and AD8 in all samples, irrespective of RAMs. Viral tropism and exposure to entry inhibitors did not impact temsavir susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the use of fostemsavir as a valuable therapy option in patients harbouring MDR virus. The role of laboratory testing in optimal screening of patients eligible for fostemsavir treatment remains to be investigated.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/9/2547/5848382;8.7;7.7;8.3;;;;;

Thus, a better understanding of the mechanisms of HIV-induced kidney cell injury is needed for effective therapy against HIV-induced kidney disease progression. We have previously shown that the acetylation and activation of key inflammatory regulators, NF-KB p65 and STAT3, were increased in HIVAN kidneys. Here, we demonstrate the key role of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) deacetylase in the regulation of NF-KB and STAT3 activity in HIVAN. We found that SIRT1 expression was reduced in the glomeruli of human and mouse HIVAN kidneys and that HIV-1 gene expression was associated with reduced SIRT1 expression and increased acetylation of NF-KB p65 and STAT3 in cultured podocytes. Interestingly, SIRT1 overexpression, in turn, reduced the expression of negative regulatory factor in podocytes stably expressing HIV-1 proviral genes, which was associated with inactivation of NF-KB p65 and a reduction in HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter activity. In vivo, the administration of the small-molecule SIRT1 agonist BF175 or inducible overexpression of SIRT1 specifically in podocytes markedly attenuated albuminuria, kidney lesions, and expression of inflammatory markers in Tg26 mice. Finally, we showed that the reduction in SIRT1 expression by HIV-1 is in part mediated through miR-34a expression. Together, our data provide a new mechanism of SIRT1 regulation and its downstream effects in HIV-1-infected kidney cells and indicate that SIRT1/miR-34a are potential drug targets to treat HIV-related kidney disease.;https://journals.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/ajprenal.00140.2020;6.5;5.5;5.3;03636127;;;;

It is also estimated that ~30-60% of PLWH on cART develop cognitive deficits associated with HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), with symptomatology ranging from asymptomatic to mild, neurocognitive impairments. Adding further complexity to HAND is the comorbidity of drug abuse in PLWH involving activated immune responses and the release of neurotoxins, which, in turn, mediate neuroinflammation. Premature or accelerated aging is another feature of drug abusing PLWH on cART regimes. Emerging studies implicate the role of HIV-1/HIV-1 proteins, cART, and abused drugs in altering the inflammasome signaling in the central nervous system (CNS) cells.

In this study, amino phenylboronic acid-modified carbon dots (APBA-CDs) were introduced as a new nanoparticle-based on gp120 targeting that inhibits HIV-1 entry processes. Prolonged by simple pyrolysis for preparing carbon dots, this report further explores attributing amino phenylboronic acid on carbon dots, which prove the formation of graphene-like structures on carbon dots and boronic acid sites, thereby enabling the enhancement of positive optical properties through photoluminescent detection. Aside from performing well in terms of biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity (the CC50 reach up to 11.2 mg/mL), APBA-CDs exhibited superior capabilities in terms of prohibiting HIV-1 entry onto targeted MOLT-4 cells recognized by the delimitations of syncitia formation and higher ATP signal rather than bare carbon dots. The modified carbon dots also promote dual-action on HIV-1 treatment by both intracellularly and extracellularly viral blocking by combining with the Duviral drug, along with compressing p24 antigen signals that are better than APBA-CDs and Duviral itself.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c00508;3.8;5.7;6.5;;;;;

An HIV-1-encoded protein, viral infectivity factor (Vif), can counteract these antiviral activities of APOBEC3 proteins. Although previous studies using in vitro cell culture systems have revealed the molecular mechanisms of the antiviral action of APOBEC3 proteins and their antagonism by Vif, it remains unclear how APOBEC3 proteins affect the kinetics of HIV-1 replication in vivo. Here we quantified the time-series of viral load datasets from humanized mice infected with HIV-1 variants in the presence of APOBEC3F, APOBEC3G, or both APOBEC3F/G using a simple mathematical model that accounted for inter-individual variability. Through experimental and mathematical investigation, we formulated and calculated the total antiviral activity of APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G based on the estimated initial growth rates of viral loads in vivo. Interestingly, we quantitatively demonstrated that compared with APOBEC3G, the antiviral activity of APOBEC3F was widely distributed but skewed toward lower activity, although their mean values were similar. We concluded that APOBEC3G markedly and robustly restricted the initial stages of viral growth in vivo. This is the first report to quantitatively elucidate how APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G differ in their anti-HIV-1 modes in vivo.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022519320301508;4.0;3.9;4.1;00225193;S0022519320301508;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0022519320301508;;

In addition to pro-apoptotic and cytostatic properties, Vpr can redirect cellular E3 ubiquitin ligases (such as DCAF1-Cul4A E3 ligase complex) to target many host proteins and interfere with their functions. Among them, Vpr binds the uracil DNA glycosylase UNG2, which controls genome uracilation, and induces its specific degradation leading to loss of uracil removal activity in infected cells. Considering the essential role of UNG2 in antibody diversification in B-cells, we evaluated the impact of Vpr on UNG2 fate in B lymphocytes and examined the functional consequences of UNG2 modulations on class switch recombination (CSR). Methods: The impact of Vpr-induced UNG2 deregulation on CSR proficiency was evaluated by using virus-like particles able to deliver Vpr protein to target cells including the murine model CSR B cell line CH12F3 and mouse primary B-cells. Co-culture experiments were used to re-examine the ability of Vpr to be released by HIV-1 infected cells and to effectively accumulate in bystander B-cells. Vpr-mediated UNG2 modulations were monitored by following UNG2 protein abundance and uracil removal enzymatic activity. Results: In this study we report the ability of Vpr to reduce immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) in immortalized and primary mouse B-cells through the degradation of UNG2. We also emphasize that Vpr is released by producing cells and penetrates bystander B lymphocytes. Conclusions: This work therefore opens up new perspectives to study alterations of the B-cell response by using Vpr as a specific CSR blocking tool. Moreover, our results raise the question of whether extracellular HIV-1 Vpr detected in some patients may manipulate the antibody diversification process that engineers an adapted response against pathogenic intruders and thereby contribute to the intrinsic B-cell humoral defect reported in infected patients.;https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-020-02478-7;7.3;7.1;6.3;;;;;

Methods: A total of 193 plasma samples were collected from the newly reported HIV-1 infected MSM in Kunming from January to December 2018. Viral RNA was extracted, and the gag, pol, env gene segments were amplified by nested PCR. HIV-1 genotypes and drug resistance were also analyzed. Subsequently, the evolutionary characteristics of CRF55_01B and CRF68_01B among MSM in Kunming were analyzed by Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. Results: Multiple HIV-1 genotypes were identified among these 193 samples, including CRF07_BC (39.4%, 76/193), CRF01_AE (34.2%, 66/193), unique recombinant forms (URFs) (20.2%, 39/193), CRF08_BC (3.1%, 6/193), CRF55_01B (1.6%, 3/193), subtype B (1.0%, 2/193) and CRF68_01B (0.5%, 1/193). Results from the Bayesian evolutionary analysis showed that CRF55_01B started to spread locally after being imported from other provinces, while CRF68_01B was likely to have been brought in from the eastern provinces of China. Prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistant strains was 2.6%(5/190) before antiviral treatment, with mutation rates resistant to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors being the highest (2.1%, 4/190) among MSM in Kunming, 2018. Conclusion: The diversity of HIV-1 was increasing among MSM in Kunming. Although the resistance rate on pretreatment drug was relatively low, the emergence of multiple resistant strains to first-line antiviral drugs posed a challenge to antiretroviral therapy, in Kunming.;http://journal.yiigle.com/LinkIn.do?linkin_type=DOI&DOI=10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20191107-00792;0.8;0;0;02546450;;;;

Efforts to identify plant derived molecules with anti-HIV properties require reproducible assay systems for routine screening of selected plant compounds. Although a number of standardized HIV-1 pseudoviruses have been generated to assess infectivity, replicability or reproducibility, HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1-C) pseudoviruses have not been comprehensively characterized to identify inhibitory plant substances. Aim of the study: The current study aimed at developing an HIV-1-C pseudovirus assay, and evaluate plant substances targeting reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. Materials and methods: HIV-1 subtype C pseudoviruses containing a luciferase reporter gene were generated by transfection of human 293T cells. HIV-1 subtype B (HIV-1-B) wild type pseudoviruses and mutants resistant to nucleoside and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors were also generated and used as controls. Selected plant substances and the RT inhibitors Zidovudine (AZT) and Nevirapine (NVP), were used to evaluate inhibition. Pseudovirus infectivity was determined by luciferase measurement in CF2/CD4+/CCR5 cells, and cytotoxicity was determined using the MTT assay. AZT and NVP inhibited wild type pseudoviruses in a dose dependent manner, with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. Results: Pseudoviruses harbouring RT drug resistance mutations were poorly suppressed by AZT and NVP. Catechin, obtained from Peltophorum africanum inhibited HIV-1-C and HIV-1-B pseudoviruses with selective indices of 6304 M (IC50: 0.49 M, CC50: 3089 M) and 1343 M (IC50: 2.3 M, CC50: 3089 M), respectively; while the methanol root crude extract of Elaeodendron transvaalense gave IC50 values of 11.11 g/ml and 16.86 g/ml, respectively.

We examined cellular immune responses in blood and gut mucosal tissue roughly two years following vaccination with placebo or the Step study vaccine MRKAd5/HIV-1. Methods: Participants vaccinated with either placebo or MRKAd5/HIV-1 during participation in HVTN 071, and HVTN 502/Merck 023 underwent phlebotomy and colonic mucosal biopsies via flexible sigmoidoscopy at two timepoints roughly six months apart. After isolation of mononuclear cells, we compared cellular phenotypes and intracellular cytokine responses in vaccine and placebo recipients with and without baseline serological reactivity to Ad5. Results: Surface expression of activation and gut-homing markers were elevated on CD4 + and CD8 + gut mucosal mononuclear cells (GMMC) in comparison with PBMC (p < 0.01), but were not significantly affected by baseline Ad5 serostatus or receipt of MRKAd5/HIV-1. ICS responses to stimulation with vaccine antigens were of low frequency and magnitude. Ad5 vector responses were seen in vaccinees and baseline seropositive individuals. CD4 + responses to vector antigens were more common in GMMC than PBMC (p < 0.01) and CD8 + responses to HIV gag insert antigens were more frequent in Ad5 seropositive than Ad5 seronegative individuals (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Vaccination with the Ad5 vectored candidate HIV vaccine MRKAd5/HIV-1 does not lead to long-term changes in the activation state of mucosal CD4 + or CD8 + T lymphocytes regardless of baseline Ad5 serostatus.

All rights reserved.The DNA sensor cGAS catalyzes the production of the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP, resulting in type I interferon responses. We addressed the functionality of cGAS-mediated DNA sensing in human and murine T cells. Activated primary CD4+ T cells expressed cGAS and responded to plasmid DNA by upregulation of ISGs and release of bioactive interferon. In mouse T cells, cGAS KO ablated sensing of plasmid DNA, and TREX1 KO enabled cells to sense short immunostimulatory DNA. Expression of IFIT1 and MX2 was down-regulated and upregulated in cGAS KO and TREX1 KO T cell lines, respectively, compared to parental cells. Despite their intact cGAS sensing pathway, human CD4+ T cells failed to mount a reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor-sensitive immune response following HIV-1 infection. In contrast, infection of human T cells with HSV-1 that is functionally deficient for the cGAS antagonist pUL41 (HSV-1UL41N) resulted in a cGAS-dependent type I interferon response. In accordance with our results in primary CD4+ T cells, plasmid challenge or HSV-1UL41N inoculation of T cell lines provoked an entirely cGAS-dependent type I interferon response, including IRF3 phosphorylation and expression of ISGs. In contrast, no RT-dependent interferon response was detected following transduction of T cell lines with VSV-G-pseudotyped lentiviral or gammaretroviral particles. Together, T cells are capable to raise a cGAS-dependent cell-intrinsic response to both plasmid DNA challenge or inoculation with HSV-1UL41N. However, HIV-1 infection does not appear to trigger cGAS-mediated sensing of viral DNA in T cells, possibly by revealing viral DNA of insufficient quantity, length, and/or accessibility to cGAS.;http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2002481117;17.1;16.1;15.7;00278424;;;;

Moreover, acetylation of the N4 position of cytidine (ac4C) was recently reported to increase the translation and stability of cellular mRNAs. Here, we show that ac4C and N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10), the enzyme that adds ac4C to RNAs, have been subverted by human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) to increase viral gene expression. HIV-1 transcripts are modified with ac4C at multiple discrete sites, and silent mutagenesis of these ac4C sites led to decreased HIV-1 gene expression. Similarly, loss of ac4C from viral transcripts due to depletion of NAT10 inhibited HIV-1 replication by reducing viral RNA stability. Interestingly, the NAT10 inhibitor remodelin could inhibit HIV-1 replication at concentrations that have no effect on cell viability, thus identifying ac4C addition as a potential target for antiviral drug development.© 2020 Elsevier Inc.Tsai et al. report that multiple cytidines on HIV-1 RNAs are acetylated to ac4C by cellular NAT10. Depletion of ac4C by mutagenesis or drug treatment reduces the stability of HIV-1 transcripts, causing reduced viral replication.

Due to unique pharmacokinetic characteristics, treatment with TAF is not associated with significant renal proximal tubular accumulation of TFV. TAF is associated with a lower risk of acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, proteinuria and renal proximal tubular dysfunction than treatment with TDF. No cases of Fanconi syndrome have been reported in clinical trials of TAF. It is unknown whether treatment with TAF can lead to accumulation of TFV in proximal tubular cells and cause nephrotoxicity under certain clinical circumstances. Case presentation: Here we report the case of a patient on stable TAF-based antiretroviral therapy with for HIV-1 infection who developed proximal tubulopathy when treated with gentamicin for febrile neutropenia in the context of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma. Eighteen days after commencing chemotherapy for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma the patient presented to hospital with fevers, hypotension and neutropenia. The patient was commenced on piperacillin, tazobactam and gentamicin. Within 24 h the patient developed marked hypokalaemia and hypophosphataemia requiring intravenous replacement therapy. There was proteinuria, glycosuria and evidence of marked urinary electrolyte wasting, consistent with acute proximal tubular dysfunction. Eleven days after the gentamicin was stopped the serum biochemistry normalised. The urinary electrolyte wasting and proteinuria had improved, and the glycosuria had resolved. Conclusion: This is the first case report to describe acute renal proximal tubulopathy in an HIV-infected patient treated with TAF and gentamicin. As the number of patients prescribed TAF outside the clinical trial setting increases, so too does the potential for previously unreported drug interactions and adverse events. Clinicians need to be aware of potential unreported adverse drug reactions as the use of TAF becomes increasingly common in clinical practice.;https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01981-9;3.4;3.0;2.8;;;;;

Here we simulated the SIVcpz initial transmission to humans using humanized mice and followed the viral evolution during serial passages lasting more than a year. All three SIVcpz progenitor viruses used, namely LB715 and MB897 (group M) as well as EK505 (group N) readily infected hu-mice resulting in chronic viremia. Viral loads increased progressively to higher set-points and the CD4+ T cell decline became more pronounced by the end of the second serial passage indicating viral adaptation and increased pathogenicity. Viral genomes sequenced at different time points revealed many non-synonymous variants not previously reported that occurred throughout the viral genome, including the gag, pol, env, and nef genes. These results shed light on the potential changes that the SIVcpz genome had undergone during the initial stages of human infection and subsequent spread.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01889/full;5.0;5.6;6.4;;;;;

The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis and its signaling pathways are involved in diverse disorders including HIV-1 infection, tumor development, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, WHIM Syndrome, and so on. The mechanisms of action of AMD3100 may relate to mobilizing hematopoietic stem cells, blocking infection of X4 HIV-1, increasing circulating neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes, reducing myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and enhancing cytotoxic T-cell infiltration in tumors. Here, we first revisit the pharmacological discovery of AMD3100. We then review monotherapy of AMD3100 and combination use of AMD3100 with other agents in various diseases. Among those, we highlight the perspective of AMD3100 as an immunomodulator to regulate immune responses particularly in the tumor microenvironment and synergize with other therapeutics.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The search for compounds that can inhibit the interaction of certain viral proteins with their cellular partners is a promising trend in the development of antiviral drugs. We have previously shown that binding of HIV-1 integrase with human Ku70 protein is essential for viral replication. Here, we present a novel, cheap, and fast assay to search for inhibitors of these proteins’ binding based on the usage of genetically encoded fluorescent tags linked to both integrase and Ku70. Using this approach, we have elucidated structure-activity relationships for a set of oligonucleotide conjugates with eosin and shown that their inhibitory activity is primarily achieved through interactions between the conjugate nucleic bases and integrase. Molecular modeling of HIV-1 integrase in complex with the conjugates suggests that they can shield E212/L213 residues in integrase, which are crucial for its efficient binding to Ku70, in a length-dependent manner. Using the developed system, we have found the 11-mer phosphorothioate bearing 3’-end eosin-Y to be the most efficient inhibitor among the tested conjugates.;https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/9/1236;8.8;8.5;2.3;;;;;

To investigate its mechanism of action, we compared it with the well-documented lamivudine (3TC). Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the intracellular retention of FNC triphosphate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was markedly longer than that of the 3TC triphosphate. FNC selectively enters and is retained in HIV target cells, where it exerts long-lasting prevention of HIV-1 infection. In addition to inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcription, FNC also restores A3G expression in CD4+ T cells in FNC-Treated HIV-1 patients. FNC binds to the Vif-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, enabling A3G to avoid Vif-induced ubiquitination and degradation. These data reveal the mechanisms underlying the superior anti-HIV potency and long-lasting action of FNC. Our results also suggest a potential clinical application of FNC as a long-lasting pre-exposure prophylactic agent capable of preventing HIV infection.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00940;11.3;10.9;11.3;00222623;;;;

Circulating CD14++CD16+ monocytes were found to accumulate and CD11c+ conventional dendritic cells (cDC) to be depleted in a Portuguese cohort of people living with HIV-2 (PLWHIV-2), compared to blood bank healthy donors (HD). We studied more precisely classical monocytes; CD16+ inflammatory (intermediate, non-classical and slan+ monocytes, known to accumulate during viremic HIV-1 infection); cDC1, important for cross-presentation, and cDC2, both depleted during HIV-1 infection. We analyzed by flow cytometry these PBMC subsets from Paris area residents: 29 asymptomatic, untreated PLWHIV-2 from the IMMUNOVIR-2 study, part of the ANRS-CO5 HIV-2 cohort: 19 long-term non-progressors (LTNP; infection 8 years, undetectable viral load, stable CD4 counts500/L; 17 of West-African origin -WA), and 10 non-LTNP (P; progressive infection; 9 WA); and 30 age-and sex-matched controls: 16 blood bank HD with unknown geographical origin, and 10 HD of WA origin (GeoHD). We measured plasma bacterial translocation markers by ELISA. Non-classical monocyte counts were higher in GeoHD than in HD (54 vs. 32 cells/L, p = 0.0002). Slan+ monocyte counts were twice as high in GeoHD than in HD (WA: 28 vs. 13 cells/L, p = 0.0002). Thus cell counts were compared only between participants of WA origin. They were similar in LTNP, P and GeoHD, indicating that there were no HIV-2 related differences. cDC counts did not show major differences between the groups. Interestingly, inflammatory monocyte counts correlated with plasma sCD14 and LBP only in PLWHIV-2, especially LTNP, and not in GeoHD. In conclusion, in LTNP PLWHIV-2, inflammatory monocyte counts correlated with LBP or sCD14 plasma levels, indicating a potential innate immune response to subclinical bacterial translocation. As GeoHD had higher inflammatory monocyte counts than HD, our data also show that specific controls are important to refine innate immunity studies.";https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01658/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;;;;

Diabetes mellitus (DM) increases tuberculosis (TB) risk. We assessed the prevalence of hyperglycemia (DM and impaired glucose regulation [IGR]) in persons with TB and the association between hyperglycemia and TB at enrollment and 3 months after TB treatment in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Methods. Adults presenting at a Cape Town TB clinic were enrolled. TB cases were defined by South African guidelines, while non-TB participants were those who presented with respiratory symptoms, negative TB tests, and resolution of symptoms 3 months later without TB treatment. HIV status was ascertained through medical records or HIV testing. All participants were screened for DM using glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose at TB treatment and after 3 months. The association between TB and DM was assessed. Results. Overall DM prevalence was 11.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.1%-15.4%) at enrollment and 9.3% (95% CI, 6.4%- 13%) at follow-up; IGR prevalence was 46.9% (95% CI, 42.2%-51.8%) and 21.5% (95% CI, 16.9%-26.3%) at enrollment and follow- up. TB/DM association was significant at enrollment (odds ratio [OR], 2.41 [95% CI, 1.3-4.3]) and follow-up (OR, 3.3 [95% CI, 1.5-7.3]), whereas TB/IGR association was only positive at enrollment (OR, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.6-3.3]). The TB/DM association was significant at enrollment in both new and preexisting DM, but only persisted at follow-up in preexisting DM in patients with HIV-1 infection. Conclusions. Our study demonstrated high prevalence of transient hyperglycemia and a significant TB/DM and TB/IGR association at enrollment in newly diagnosed DM, but persistent hyperglycemia and TB/DM association in patients with HIV-1 infection and preexisting DM, despite TB therapy.";https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/4/1080/5574636;14.0;13.8;12.5;;;;;

A cure strategy for HIV-1 has eluded scientists, but gene editing technologies such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) offer a new approach to developing a cure for HIV infection. While the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been used successfully in a number of different types of studies, there remains a concern for off-target effects. This review details the different aspects of the Cas9 system and how they play a role in off-target events. In addition, this review describes the current technologies available for detecting off-target cleavage events and their advantages and disadvantages. While some studies have utilized whole genome sequencing (WGS), this method sacrifices depth of coverage for interrogating the whole genome. A number of different approaches have now been developed to take advantage of next generation sequencing (NGS) without sacrificing depth of coverage. This review highlights four widely used methods for detecting off-target events: (1) genome-wide unbiased identification of double-stranded break events enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-Seq), (2) discovery of in situ Cas off-targets and verification by sequencing (DISCOVER-Seq), (3) circularization for in vitro reporting of cleavage effects by sequencing (CIRCLE-Seq), and (4) breaks labeling in situ and sequencing (BLISS). Each of these technologies has advantages and disadvantages, but all center around capturing double-stranded break (DSB) events catalyzed by the Cas9 endonuclease. Being able to define off-target events is crucial for a gene therapy cure strategy for HIV-1.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01872/full;5.0;5.6;6.4;;;;;

Antibodies targeting the C-terminal sequence of the membrane-proximal external region (C-MPER) block the fusogenic activity of gp41 and achieve neutralization of divergent HIV-1 strains and isolates. Thus, recreating the structure that generates broadly neutralizing C-MPER antibodies during infection is a major goal in HIV vaccine development. Here, we have reconstituted a peptide termed CpreTM-TMD in a membrane environment. This peptide contains the C-MPER epitope and the minimum TMD residues required for the anchorage of the Env glycoprotein to the viral membrane. In addition, we have used antibody 10E8 variants to gauge the antigenic configuration attained by CpreTM-TMD as a function of the membrane cholesterol content, a functional determinant of the HIV envelope and liposome-based vaccines. Differential binding of the 10E8 variants and the trend of the IgG responses recovered from rabbits immunized with liposome-peptide formulations, suggested that cholesterol may restrict 10E8 accessibility to the C-MPER epitope. Our data ruled out the destabilization of the lipid bilayer architecture in CpreTM-TMD-containing membranes, and pointed to the perturbation of the helical conformation by lipid packing as the cause of the antigenic configuration loss induced by cholesterol. Overall, our results provide additional insights into the structural basis of the Env complex anchoring to membranes, and suggest new approaches to the design of effective immunogens directed against the near pan-neutralizing HIV-1 epitope C-MPER.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00243;4.3;6.0;7.3;;;;;

Notably, 8a exhibited better druggability than that of K-5a2, including significantly reduced CYP enzymatic inhibitory activity (IC50 > 50 M), lower human ether-à-go-go related gene (hERG) inhibition (IC50 > 30 M), and improved metabolic stability (short half-life, T1/2 = 77.5 min) in vitro.";https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00327;4.3;6.0;7.3;;;;;

In turn, HIV-1 has evolved strategies to evade innate immune sensing by DCs resulting in suboptimal maturation and poor antiviral immune responses. We previously showed that complement-opsonized HIV-1 (HIV-C) was able to efficiently infect various DC subsets significantly higher than non-opsonized HIV-1 (HIV) and therefore also mediate a higher antiviral immunity. Thus, complement coating of HIV-1 might play a role with respect to viral control occurring early during infection via modulation of DCs. To determine in detail which complement receptors (CRs) expressed on DCs was responsible for infection and superior pro-inflammatory and antiviral effects, we generated stable deletion mutants for the -chains of CR3, CD11b, and CR4, CD11c using CRISPR/Cas9 in THP1-derived DCs. We found that CD11c deletion resulted in impaired DC infection as well as antiviral and pro-inflammatory immunity upon exposure to complement-coated HIV-1. In contrast, sole expression of CD11b on DCs shifted the cells to an anti-inflammatory, regulatory DC type. We here illustrated that CR4 comprised of CD11c and CD18 is the major player with respect to DC infection associated with a potent early pro-inflammatory immune response. A more detailed characterization of CR3 and CR4 functions using our powerful tool might open novel avenues for early therapeutic intervention during HIV-1 infection.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2020.02010/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;;;;

Perinatal treatment with lopinavir boosted by ritonavir (LPV/r) is associated with steroidogenic abnormalities. Long-term effects in infants have not been studied. Methods. Adrenal-hormone profiles were compared at weeks 6 and 26 between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-exposed but uninfected infants randomly assigned at 7 days of life to prophylaxis with LPV/r or lamivudine (3TC) to prevent transmission during breastfeeding. LPV/r in vitro effect on steroidogenesis was assessed in H295R cells. Results. At week 6, 159 frozen plasma samples from Burkina Faso and South Africa were assessed (LPV/r group: n = 92; 3TC group: n = 67) and at week 26, 95 samples from Burkina Faso (LPV/r group: n = 47; 3TC group: n = 48). At week 6, LPV/rtreated infants had a higher median dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) level than infants from the 3TC arm: 3.91 versus 1.48 ng/mL (P < .001). Higher DHEA levels (>5 ng/mL) at week 6 were associated with higher 17-OH-pregnenolone (7.78 vs 3.71 ng/mL, P = .0004) and lower testosterone (0.05 vs 1.34 ng/mL, P = .009) levels in LPV/r-exposed children. There was a significant correlation between the DHEA and LPV/r AUC levels (p = 0.40, P = .019) and Ctrough (p = 0.40, P = .017). At week 26, DHEA levels remained higher in the LPV/r arm: 0.45 versus 0.13 ng/mL (P = .002). Lopinavir, but not ritonavir, inhibited CYP17A1 and CYP21A2 activity in H295R cells. Conclusions. Lopinavir was associated with dose-dependent adrenal dysfunction in infants.

Residing in resting CD4+ T cells and myeloid cells at multiple locations in the body, including sanctuary sites such as the brain, the latent reservoir is not eliminated by ART and has the ability to reactivate virus replication to pre-therapy levels when ART is ceased. There are four broad areas of HIV cure research. The only successful cure strategy, thus far, is stem cell transplantation using naturally HIV resistant CCR532 stem cells. A second potential cure approach uses gene editing technology, such as zinc-finger nucleases and CRISPR/Cas9. Another two cure strategies aim to control the HIV reservoir, with polar opposite concepts; The “shock and kill” approach, which aims to “shock” or reactivate the latent virus and then “kill” infected cells via targeted immune responses. Lastly, the “block and lock” approach, which aims to enhance the latent virus state by “blocking” HIV transcription and “locking” the HIV promoter in a deep latent state via epigenetic modifications. “Shock and kill” approaches are a major focus of cure studies, however we predict that the increased specificity of “block and lock” approaches will be required for the successful development of a sustained HIV clinical remission in the absence of ART. This review focuses on the current research of novel “block and lock” approaches being explored to generate an HIV cure via induction of epigenetic silencing. We will also discuss potential future therapeutic delivery and the challenges associated with progressing “block and lock” cure approaches as these move toward clinical trials.";https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fcimb.2020.00424/full;4.2;3.8;5.4;;;;;

Such exposure might have implications on cross-resistance to dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapies (ART). Case presentation: We report a 65 years old Cameroonian, previously exposed to raltegravir, and failing on third-line treatment with multi-drug resistance to darunavir/r and dolutegravir. Genotypic resistance testing (GRT) and viral tropism were performed during monitoring time points. The patient initiated ART in August 2007. At the time point of the first (29.04.2010), second (01.12.2017) and third (08.08.2019) GRT, prior ART exposure included 3TC, d4T, NVP and EFV; additionally TDF, DRV/r and RAL; and additionally ABC and DTG respectively. First GRT revealed mutations associated with resistance only to first-generation Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Second GRT revealed mutations associated with high-level resistance to all NRTIs, first generation NNRTIs, all ritonavir boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r), and all INSTI, while viral tropism (using geno2pheno) revealed a CCR5-tropic virus with a false positive rate (FPR) of 60.9% suggesting effectiveness of maraviroc (MRV). The third GRT showed high-level resistance to NRTI, NNRTI, all PI and all INSTI, with additional mutations (H221HY for NNRTI and S147G for INSTI), and a CCR5-tropic virus with a slightly reduced FPR (57.0%). Without any locally available active therapeutic option, the patient has been on a maintenance therapy with ""DRV/r (600mg x 2/day)+TDF+3TC""and patient/family-centered adherence has been reinforced. Since the first viral load (VL) measurement in 2010, the patient has had 12 VL tests with the VL ranging from 4.97 Log to 6.44 Log copies/mL and the CD4 count never exceeded 200 cells/L.

However, life-long treatments could result in the emergence of drug-resistant viruses that can progressively reduce the number of therapeutic options, facilitating the progression of the disease. In this scenario, we previously demonstrated that inhibitors of the human DDX3X helicase can represent an innovative approach for the simultaneous treatment of HIV and other viral infections such as Hepatitis c virus (HCV). We reported herein 6b, a novel DDX3X inhibitor that thanks to its distinct target of action is effective against HIV-1 strains resistant to currently approved drugs. Its improved in vitro ADME properties allowed us to perform preliminary in vivo studies in mice, which highlighted optimal biocompatibility and an improved bioavailability.

Targeting CA represents an attractive yet underexplored antiviral approach. Of all known CA-targeting small molecule chemotypes, the peptidomimetic PF74 is particularly interesting because it binds to the same pocket used by a few important host factors, resulting in highly desirable antiviral phenotypes. However, further development of PF74 entails understanding its pharmacophore and mitigating its poor metabolic stability.

Selected analogs were also tested for metabolic stability in liver microsomes, alone or in the presence of a CYP3A inhibitor.

Although roles of active Gsk3 in liver ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) have been well appreciated, whether Gsk3 N-terminal serine phosphorylation has any functional significance in the disease process remains unclear. In a murine liver partial warm ischemia model, we studied Gsk3 N-terminal serine mutant knock-in (KI) mice and showed that liver IRI was decreased in Gsk3aS21A but increased in Gsk3bS9A mutant KI mice. Bone marrow chimeric experiments revealed that the Gsk3a, but not b, mutation in liver parenchyma protected from IRI, and both mutations in bone marrow derived cells exacerbated liver injuries. Mechanistically, mutant Gsk3a protected hepatocytes from inflammatory (TNF-a) cell death by the activation of HIV-1 TAT-interactive protein 60 (TIP60) mediated autophagy pathway. The pharmacological inhibition of TIP60 or autophagy diminished the protection of the Gsk3a mutant hepatocytes from inflammatory cell death in vitro and the Gsk3a mutant KI mice from liver IRI in vivo. Thus, Gsk3 N-terminal serine phosphorylation inhibits liver innate immune activation but suppresses hepatocyte autophagy in response to inflammation. Gsk3 aS21, but not bS9, mutation is sufficient to sustain Gsk4 activities in hepatocytes and protect livers from IRI via TIP60 activation.;http://www.jimmunol.org/lookup/doi/10.4049/jimmunol.2000397;9.2;8.7;8.3;00221767;;;;

Additional comparisons were performed between people with HIV (PWH), participants with Alzheimer disease (AD), and HIV-negative controls (HIV-). We also calculated the diagnostic characteristics of CSF NfL and its ratios in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) diagnosis. METHODS: CSF NfL, T-tau, and P-tau181 concentrations were measured using immunoassays in a total of 108 CSF samples, including PWH (n = 68), HIV- (n = 16), and participants with AD (n = 24). These proteins were compared between HIV-1B (n = 27) and HIV-1C (n = 26) using multiple linear regression adjusted for nadir CD4 and plasma viral load suppression. Comparisons between PWH, HIV-, and participants with AD were adjusted for gender and age. RESULTS: CSF neurocytoskeleton proteins and their ratios were comparable in HIV-1B and HIV-1C. However, the HIV-1C group had a higher proportion of samples of CSF NfL above the reference value (n = 14, 53.85%) than the HIV-1B group (n = 8, 29.63%), P = 0.098. The values of CSF NfL were higher in the AD group [2578 (1864; 3500) pg/mL] than those in PWH [683 (500; 1197) pg/mL, P < 0.001] and control [660 (539; 802) pg/mL, P = 0.012] groups. The value of CSF NfL and its ratios for HAND diagnosis were poor. CONCLUSION: The effects of HIV-1B and HIV-1C on CSF NfL and tau ratios were comparable.

A better understanding of the virologic failure of ART and the HIV-1 transmission network dynamics is essential for the surveillance and prevention of HIV. Here, we analyzed the HIV-1 CRF07_BC strain genetic transmission networks and their associated factors among people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) who had virologic failure of ART by using close genetic links. Methods: The drug-resistant mutations were determined using the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database. HIV-1 pol genes sequences were used for phylogenetic and genotypic drug resistance analysis. The genetic transmission networks were performed by comparing sequences, constructing the phylogenetic tree, calculating the pairwise distance, and visualizing the network. Results: A total of 1050 PLWH with CRF07_BC pol sequences were finally identified and included in the genetic transmission network analysis from 2016 to 2017. Of the 1050 CRF07_BC pol sequences, 346 (32.95%) fell into clusters at a genetic distance of 0.006, resulting in 137 clusters ranging in size from 2 to 40 individuals. Subjects who were widowed or divorced were less likely to form a genetic transmission network (adjusted OR: 0.50), while subjects who had shared a needle  five times were more likely to form a network (adjusted OR: 1.88). Conclusions: The genetic transmission networks revealed the complex transmission pattern, highlighting the urgent need for transmission monitoring of virologic failure of ART and selection of more effective therapeutic regimens to promote viral suppression.;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05347-2;4.5;4.3;4.1;;;;;

Methods: This study enrolled 200 newly diagnosed young students with HIV-1 infection in Nanjing from September 2015 to July 2019. Demographic information and blood samples were collected. Through RNA extraction and PCR amplification, 191 pol fragments were successfully obtained and subjected to genotyping and drug resistance analysis. Results: CRF01_AE (41.4%) and CRF07_BC (30.9%) were the predominant genotypes, followed by unique recombinant forms (URFs) (15.7%), CRF55_01B (5.2%), CRF68_01B (3.1%), CRF67_01B (2.6%), and subtype B (1.0 %). The incidence of drug-resistant mutations was 16.8%, and the rate of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) was 4.2%. The rates of TDR in CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, CRF55_01B, URFs and other genotypes were 2.5%, 1.7%, 10.0%, 10.0% and 7.7%, respectively (P>0.05).

Successful development of ART can be accelerated by accurate structural and biochemical data on targets and their responses to inhibitors. One important ART target, HIV integrase (IN), has historically been studied in vitro in a modified form adapted to bacterial overexpression, with a methionine or a longer fusion protein sequence at the N-terminus. In contrast, IN present in viral particles is produced by proteolytic cleavage of the Pol polyprotein, which leaves a phenylalanine at the N-terminus (IN 1F). Inspection of available structures suggested that added residues on the N-terminus might disrupt proper protein folding and formation of multimeric complexes. Results: We purified HIV-1 IN 1F1-212 and solved its structure at 2.4 Å resolution, which showed extension of an N-terminal helix compared to the published structure of IN1-212. Full-length IN 1F showed increased in vitro catalytic activity in assays of coupled joining of the two viral DNA ends compared to two IN variants containing additional N-terminal residues. IN 1F was also altered in its sensitivity to inhibitors, showing decreased sensitivity to the strand-transfer inhibitor raltegravir and increased sensitivity to allosteric integrase inhibitors. In solution, IN 1F exists as monomers and dimers, in contrast to other IN preparations which exist as higher-order oligomers. Conclusions: The structural, biochemical, and biophysical characterization of IN 1F reveals the conformation of the native HIV-1 IN N-terminus and accompanying unique biochemical and biophysical properties. IN 1F thus represents an improved reagent for use in integration reactions in vitro and the development of antiretroviral agents.;https://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12977-020-00537-x;7.3;6.7;6.7;;;;;

METHODS: The 7nAChR gene knockout mice (7R-/-) were crossed with HIV-1gp120 transgenic mice (gp120+) to generate F1 generation mice. We selected the F1 mice with the genotype of 7R+/-/gp120+ to mate to obtain the F2 mice. The genotypes of the F3 mice were identified by PCR, and the protein expressions in the double transgenic animal model was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. BV2 cells were treated with gp120 protein and 7nAChR inhibitor, and the expressions of IL-1 and TNF- were detected using ELISA. RESULTS: The results of PCR showed the bands of the expected size in F3 mice. Two F3 mice with successful double gene editing (7R-/-/gp120+) were obtained, and immunohistochemistry showed that the brain tissue of the mice did not express 7 nAChR but with high gp120 protein expression. In the in vitro cell experiment, treatment with gp120 promoted the secretion of IL-1 and TNF- in BV2 cells, while inhibition of 7nAChR significantly decreased the expression of IL-1 and TNF- (P &lt; 0.001).

Broadly-inhibiting compounds that act on elements shared by many viruses are promising antiviral candidates. Here, we identify a peptide derived from the cowpox virus protein CPXV012 as a broad-spectrum antiviral peptide. We found that CPXV012 peptide hampers infection by a multitude of clinically and economically important enveloped viruses, including poxviruses, herpes simplex virus-1, hepatitis B virus, HIV-1, and Rift Valley fever virus. Infections with non-enveloped viruses such as Coxsackie B3 virus and adenovirus are not affected. The results furthermore suggest that viral particles are neutralized by direct interactions with CPXV012 peptide and that this cationic peptide may specifically bind to and disrupt membranes composed of the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylserine, an important component of many viral membranes. The combined results strongly suggest that CPXV012 peptide inhibits virus infections by direct interactions with phosphatidylserine in the viral envelope. These results reiterate the potential of cationic peptides as broadly-acting virus inhibitors.;https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/9/9/1989;0;0;0;;;;;

However, some people living with HIV who are heavily treatment-experienced have limited or no treatment options, owing to multidrug resistance6. In addition, suboptimal adherence to oral daily regimens can negatively affect the outcome of treatment—which contributes to virologic failure, resistance generation and viral transmission—as well as of pre-exposure prophylaxis, leading to new infections1,2,4,7–9. Long-acting agents from new antiretroviral classes can provide much-needed treatment options for people living with HIV who are heavily treatment-experienced, and additionally can improve adherence10. Here we describe GS-6207, a small molecule that disrupts the functions of HIV capsid protein and is amenable to long-acting therapy owing to its high potency, low in vivo systemic clearance and slow release kinetics from the subcutaneous injection site. Drawing on X-ray crystallographic information, we designed GS-6207 to bind tightly at a conserved interface between capsid protein monomers, where it interferes with capsid-protein-mediated interactions between proteins that are essential for multiple phases of the viral replication cycle. GS-6207 exhibits antiviral activity at picomolar concentrations against all subtypes of HIV-1 that we tested, and shows high synergy and no cross-resistance with approved antiretroviral drugs. In phase-1 clinical studies, monotherapy with a single subcutaneous dose of GS-6207 (450 mg) resulted in a mean log10-transformed reduction of plasma viral load of 2.2 after 9 days, and showed sustained plasma exposure at antivirally active concentrations for more than 6 months. These results provide clinical validation for therapies that target the functions of HIV capsid protein, and demonstrate the potential of GS-6207 as a long-acting agent to treat or prevent infection with HIV.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2443-1;53.7;55.7;51.0;00280836;;;;

This study aims to identify HIV transmission patterns and pathways in a rural county area and provide insight for developing effective HIV prevention strategies among older adults. Epidemiological field surveys combined with phylogenetic analysis were used to identify potential HIV transmission linkage in one rural county with a rapidly increasing HIV epidemic among older adults. A total of 160 HIV-positive individuals and their HIV-positive sexual partners diagnosed between 2015 and 2018 were recruited. Among them, 69.4% (n = 111) were diagnosed at age 50 or older, 68.1% (n = 109) were men, and 55.0% (n = 88) were married. Ninety-six participants self-reported as having been infected with HIV through commercial heterosexual behavior and 24 were infected from their HIV-positive spouse. CRF08_BC (67.0%, n = 73) and CRF07_AE (19.3%, n = 21) were the prevalent HIV stains and formed 15 clusters at distance cutoff of 0.0025. Participants diagnosed with HIV at age 50, those who were divorced or bereft their spouse, or infected with HIV locally were more prevalent within the 15 molecular clusters. We identified specific venues as the primary hotspot and found that commercial heterosexual contact between older men and commercial sex workers contributed to the local HIV epidemic. In rural areas with an increasing HIV epidemic, detecting HIV transmission clusters through epidemiological and phylogenetic analysis as well as designing localized HIV prevention strategies should be prioritized.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2019.0293;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;;

P-TEFb is also an essential cellular factor recruited by the viral protein Tat to ensure the replication of the viral RNA in the infection cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Tat promotes the release of P-TEFb from the 7SKsnRNP and subsequent activation of transcription, by displacing HEXIM from the 5’-hair-pin of the 7SKsnRNA. This hairpin (HP1), comprising the signature sequence of the 7SKsnRNA, has been the subject of three independent structural studies aimed at identifying the structural features that could drive the recognition by the two proteins, both depending on arginine-rich motifs (ARM). Interestingly, four distinct structures were determined. In an attempt to provide a comprehensive view of the structure-function relationship of this versatile RNA, we present here a structural analysis of the models, highlighting how HP1 is able to adopt distinct conformations with significant impact on the compactness of the molecule. Since these models are solved under different conditions by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and crystallography, the impact of the buffer composition on the conformational variation was investigated by complementary biophysical approaches. Finally, using isothermal titration calorimetry, we determined the thermodynamic signatures of the Tat-ARM and HEXIM-ARM peptide interactions with the RNA, showing that they are associated with distinct binding mechanisms.;http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/lookup/doi/10.1261/rna.074955.120;7.6;6.9;7.1;13558382;;;;

Most of the compounds we synthetized showed high activity against wild-type HIV-1 strain (IIIB) while IC50 values are in the range of 0.06–12.95 M. Among them, the most active HIV-1 inhibitor was compound 6-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-ylmethyl)-5-ethyl-2-((2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxoethyl)thio)pyrimidin-4(3H)-one (5b), which exhibited similar HIV-1 inhibitory potency (IC50 = 0.06 M, CC50 = 96.23 M) compared with nevirapine (IC50 = 0.04 M, CC50 >200 M) and most of compounds exhibited submicromolar IC50 values indicating they were specific RT inhibitors. The compounds 5b, 6-(benzo[d] [1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-5-ethyl-2-((2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxoethyl)thio)pyrimidin-4(3H)-one (5c) and 4-(2-((4-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-ylmethyl)-5-ethyl-6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyrimidin-2-yl)thio)acetyl)phenylbenzo[d][1,3]dioxole-5-carboxylate (5r) were selected for further study. It was found that all of them had little toxicity to peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), and had a good inhibitory effect on the replication of HIV-1 protease inhibitor resistant strains, fusion inhibitor resistant strains and nucleosides reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistant strains, as well as on clinical isolates.

One class of these drugs are non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) that target the viral reverse transcriptase (RT). First generation NNRTIs were troubled with poor pharmacological properties and drug resistance, incentivizing the development of improved compounds. One class of developed compounds are the 2-naphthyl phenyl ethers, showing promising efficacy against the Y181C RT mutation. Further biochemical and structural work demonstrated differences in potency against the Y181C mutation and binding mode of the compounds. This work aims to understand the relationship between the binding mode and ability to overcome drug resistance using macromolecular x-ray crystallography. Comparison of 2-naphthyl phenyl ethers bound to Y181C RT reveal that compounds that interact with the invariant W229 are more capable of retaining efficacy against the resistance mutation. Additional modifications to these compounds at the 4-position, computationally designed to compensate for the Y181C mutation, do not demonstrate improved potency. Ultimately, we highlight important considerations for the development of future HIV-1 drugs that are able to combat drug resistance.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pro.3910;4.6;4.6;5.4;09618368;;;;

The protective role of V2 Abs has not yet been determined, and the antiviral function of V2 Abs that mediate protection against HIV-1 in humans or SHIV infection in rhesus macaques remains unclear. V2 Abs do not neutralize resistant tier 2 viruses; their Fc-mediated activities are modest and similar to those of another anti-envelope Abs, and inhibition of the gp120–47 integrin interaction is ineffective in both animals and clinical trials. Moreover, in protection experiments in monkeys, levels of V1V2 vaccine-induced V2 Abs do not correlate with plasma viral load. Together, these observations suggest that V2 Abs may not control SHIV infection in rhesus macaques and that V2 Abs may instead be a surrogate marker of other protective immune responses.";https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21645515.2020.1787070;4.1;4.2;4.7;21645515;;;;

Previous studies show that resveratrol binds and inhibits DNA polymerases and some other enzymes; however, the binding and functioning mechanisms remain unknown. The elucidated knowledge of inhibitory mechanisms of resveratrol will assist us in new drug discovery. We utilized molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to reveal how resveratrol and structurally similar compounds bind to various nucleotide-dependent enzymes, specifically, DNA polymerases, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and ribonucleotide reductase. The results show that resveratrol and its analogs exert their inhibitory effects by competing with the substrate dNTPs in these enzymes and blocking elongation of chain polymerization. In addition, the results imply that resveratrol binds to a variety of other ATP-/NTP-binding proteins.";https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/9/1223;8.8;8.5;2.3;;;;;

Objective: To compare the efficacy of 2 scalable ART clinic-based interventions on alcohol use and viral suppression. Design, Setting, and Participants: This 3-group randomized clinical trial was conducted among 440 adults with HIV who were being treated at 7 ART clinics in Thai Nguyen, Vietnam. Adults receiving ART with hazardous alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption score 4 for men or 3 for women) and no plans to leave Thai Nguyen were included. Data were collected from March 2016 to May 2018 and analyzed from June 2018 to February 2020. Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to standard of care (SOC), a combined intervention of motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (6 in-person sessions of 1 hour each and 3 optional group sessions), or a brief intervention with similar components as the combined intervention but consisting of 2 shorter in-person sessions and 2 telephone sessions. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary study outcomes were percentage of days abstinent from alcohol, confirmed using the alcohol biomarker phosphatidylethanol, and viral suppression at 12 months after enrollment. Results: A total of 440 eligible individuals (mean [SD] age, 40.2 [5.8] years; 426 [96.8%] men) were enrolled; 147 (33.4%) were assigned to the combined intervention, 147 (33.4%) to the brief intervention, and 146 (33.2%) to SOC. In the combined intervention group, 112 participants (76.2%) attended all 6 sessions, and in the brief intervention group, 124 (84.4%) attended all 4 sessions; in the whole sample, 390 (88.6%) completed 12 months of follow-up. At 12 months, the mean (SE) percentage of days abstinent was 65% (3.1%) among those in the combined intervention group, 65% (3.2%) among those in the brief intervention group, and 50% (3.4%) among those in the in the SOC group (Cohen d for combined intervention vs SOC and brief intervention vs SOC: 39%; 95% CI, 15% to 64%). Viral suppression (ie, <20 copies of HIV-1 RNA per milliliter) at 12 months was higher after the brief intervention than SOC (difference, 11%; 95% CI, 2% to 20%), but the difference between the combined intervention and SOC was not significantly different (difference, 5%; 95%, CI, -5% to 15%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, the brief intervention resulted in a significant increase in percentage of days abstinent from alcohol and a significant increase in viral suppression after 12 months. Future implementation science studies evaluating scale-up of the brief intervention are needed.

Rare in their emergence and antigen recognition mode, bnAbs are active toward a large set of different viral strains. Isolation, characterization and production of bnAbs lead to their possible use in passive immunotherapy and form the basis for an educated effort in the development of vaccines for universal coverage. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies targeting the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) may lead to antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, possibly hampering the field of vaccine development. This perspective points to the identification of conserved regions in the spike of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV through investigation, dissection and recombinant production of isolated moieties. These spike moieties should be capable of independent folding and allow the detection as well as the elicitation of bnAbs, thus setting the basis for an effective passive immunotherapy and the development of a universal vaccine against human epidemic coronaviruses (HCoVs). SARS, MERS and, most of all, COVID-19 demonstrate that humanity is the target of HCoV, preparedness for future hits is thus no longer an option.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmolb.2020.00226/full;4.2;5.4;5.1;;;;;

HM1.24 plays a role in diverse cellular functions, including cell signaling, immune modulation, and malignancy. In addition, it also functions as an interferon-induced cellular antiviral restriction factor that inhibits the replication and release of diverse enveloped viruses, and which is counteracted by Vpu, an HIV-1 accessory protein. Vpu induces down-regulation and ubiquitin conjugation to the cytoplasmic domain of HM1.24. However, evidence for ubiquitination site(s) of HM1.24 remains controversial. We demonstrated that HM1.24 is constitutively poly-ubiquitinated at the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, and that the mutation of all potential ubiquitination sites, including serine, threonine, cysteine, and lysine in the cytoplasmic domain of HM1.24, does not affect the ubiquitination of HM1.24. We further demonstrated that although a GPI anchor is necessary and sufficient for HM1.24 antiviral activities and virion-trapping, the deleted mutant of GPI does not influence the ubiquitination of HM1.24. These results suggest that the lipid raft localization of HM1.24 is not a prerequisite for the ubiquitination. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that the ubiquitination of HM1.24 occurs at the N-terminal amino acid in the cytoplasmic domain and indicate that the constitutive ubiquitination machinery of HM1.24 may differ from the Vpu-induced machinery.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2405580820300935;1.1;2.3;3.6;;S2405580820300935;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2405580820300935;;

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) comprise a sub-population that plays multiple pro-tumoral roles in tumor development including general immunosuppression, which can be identified in terms of high expression of mannose receptor (MR or CD206). Immunosuppressive TAMs, like other macrophage sub-populations, display functional plasticity that allows them to be re-programmed to inflammatory macrophages. In order to mitigate immunosuppression at the TME, several efforts are ongoing to effectively re-educate pro-tumoral TAMs. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), released by both normal and tumor cells types, are emerging as key mediators of the cell to cell communication and have been shown to have a role in the modulation of immune responses in the TME. Recent studies demonstrated the enrichment of high mannose glycans on the surface of small EVs (sEVs), a subtype of EVs of endosomal origin of 30–150 nm in diameter. This characteristic renders sEVs an ideal tool for the delivery of therapeutic molecules into MR/CD206-expressing TAMs. In this review, we report the most recent literature data highlighting the critical role of TAMs in tumor development, as well as the experimental evidences that has emerged from the biochemical characterization of sEV membranes. In addition, we propose an original way to target immunosuppressive TAMs at the TME by endogenously engineered sEVs for a new therapeutic approach against solid tumors.;https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/17/6318;5.1;5.2;5.3;16616596;;;;

We conducted a systematic analysis of three important envelope glycoprotein (Env) vaccine candidates: BG505 SOSIP.664, 1086.C gp140, and 1086.C gp120 to determine the most promising by comparing their structure and antigenicity. We found that the BG505 SOSIP trimer and 1086.C gp140 clearly outperformed the 1086.C gp120 monomer. BG505 SOSIP.664 bound the strongest to the most potent and broadest broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) PG9, PGT145, VRC01, and PGT121. Of interest, although BG505 SOSIP.664 did not bind to the CH58 mAb, 1086.C gp140 bound strongly to this mAb, which belongs to a class of non-neutralizing antibodies that may be protective based on correlates of protection studies of the RV144 HIV vaccine trial. The 1086.C gp120 monomer was the least antigenic of the three vaccine immunogens, binding the weakest to bnAbs and CH58 mAb. Taken together, the evidence provided here combined with previous preclinical immunogenicity and efficacy data strongly argue that the BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer and 1086.C gp140 are likely to be better vaccine immunogens than the monomeric 1086.C gp120, which was just recently tested and shown to be nonefficacious in a phase IIb/III trial. Thus, to best utilize our financial and valuable human resources, we propose a systematic approach by not only comparing structure and antigenicity, but also immunogenicity and efficacy of Env vaccine candidates in the preclinical phase to the selection of only the most promising vaccine candidates for clinical testing.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2019.0239;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;;

As the respiratory tract connects to the brain without protection of the blood–brain barrier, SARS-CoV-2 might in the early invasive phase attack the cardiorespiratory centres located in the medulla/pons areas, giving rise to disturbances of respiration and cardiac problems. Furthermore, brainstem regions are at risk to lose their functional integrity. Therefore, long-term neurological as well as psychiatric symptomatology and eventual respective disorders cannot be excluded as evidenced from influenza-A triggered post-encephalitic Parkinsonism and HIV-1 triggered AIDS–dementia complex. From the available evidences for coronavirus-induced brain pathology, this review concludes a number of unmet needs for further research strategies like human postmortem brain analyses. SARS-CoV-2 mirroring experimental animal brain studies, characterization of time-dependent and region-dependent spreading behaviours of coronaviruses, enlightening of pathological mechanisms after coronavirus infection using long-term animal models and clinical observations of patients having had COVID-19 infection are calling to develop both protective strategies and drug discoveries to avoid early and late coronavirus-induced functional brain disturbances, symptoms and eventually disorders. To fight SARS-CoV-2, it is an urgent need to enforce clinical, molecular biological, neurochemical and genetic research including brain-related studies on a worldwide harmonized basis.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00702-020-02230-x;5.1;5.5;6.0;03009564;;;;

The provirus is permanently integrated into the host cell chromosome and is expressed by the host cell transcription, RNA processing, and translation machinery. Retroviral messenger RNAs (mRNAs) entirely resemble a cellular mRNA as they have a 5cap structure, 5untranslated region (UTR), an open reading frame (ORF), 3UTR, and a 3poly(A) tail. The primary transcription product interacts with the cellular RNA processing machinery and is spliced, exported to the cytoplasm, and translated. However, a proportion of the pre-mRNA subverts typical RNA processing giving rise to the full-length RNA. In the cytoplasm, the full-length retroviral RNA fulfills a dual role acting as mRNA and as the gRNA. Simple retroviruses generate two pools of full-length RNA, one for each purpose. However, complex retroviruses have a single pool of full-length RNA, which is destined for translation or encapsidation. As for eukaryotic mRNAs, translational control of retroviral protein synthesis is mostly exerted at the step of initiation. Interestingly, some retroviral mRNAs, both simple and complex, use a dual mechanism to initiate protein synthesis, a cap-dependent initiation mechanism, or via internal initiation using an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). In this review, we describe and discuss data regarding the molecular mechanism driving the canonical cap-dependent and IRES-mediated translation initiation for retroviral mRNA, focusing the discussion mainly on the most studied retroviral mRNA, the HIV-1 mRNA.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1874939920301668;10.6;10.2;9.4;18749399;S1874939920301668;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1874939920301668;;

Among HLA molecules, HLA-C, the most recently evolved form of class I antigens, is subjected to both transcriptional and multiple post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms affecting its cell surface expression. Among the latter a region placed in the 3 untranslated region of HLA-C transcript contains the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs67384697 “G-ins/del” that has been found to be strictly associated with surface levels of HLA-C allomorphs because of the effect on the binding site of a microRNA (Hsa-miR-148a). Higher expression of HLA-C has been proved to influence HIV-1 infection via a better control of viremia and a slower disease progression. More importantly, the analysis of SNP rs67384697 “G-ins/del” combined with the evaluation of the HLA-Bw4/-Bw6 C1/C2 supratype, as well as the killer immunoglobulin-like receptor genetic asset, has proved to be pivotal in defining the status of Elite Controllers in the Caucasian population. Here we describe a new reliable and fast method of allele-specific real-time PCR to monitor the integrity/disruption of the binding site of the microRNA Hsa-miR-148a in a high-throughput format that can be easily applied to studies involving large cohorts of individuals.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tan.13971;2.9;2.8;2.7;20592302;;;;

This paper aims to evaluate the number of lost donors and lost cells in the culture by means of verifying both the results of the qualification tests and the presence of microorganisms in the cellular material. The analysis involved 86 donors hospitalized for thermal burns, from whom cells were harvested for keratinocyte and fibroblast cultures in the years 2011 to 2015. All potential donors underwent qualification tests: Anti-HIV-1,2; HBsAg; Anti-HCV-Ab; HBc, and a specific test for syphilis. In the case of skin fragments collected for culturing, the microbiological tests included the carrying fluid, the medium after 1 change, and the medium during culturing and before transplantation. Skin donors for cell cultures were assigned to the groups based on if the skin was collected up to 7 days following the burn or later. On average, 12% of the disqualifications were reported among donors for cell culturing. The most frequent cause of donor disqualification (54% of all disqualifications) was a positive HBc(+). The occurrence of fungal infections detected in the cellular material was over 30%. Establishing the culture after day 7 following the injury immediately increases the risk of infection by 25% in comparison to those cultures established before or on day 7 following the injury. Proper disinfection of donor place is crucial, but sometimes insufficient for maintenance sterility in cell culture.

These negatively charged molecules coordinate an electropositive ring of arginines at the center of pores distributed throughout the capsid surface. Kinetic studies indicate that the binding of IP6 increases the stable lifetimes of the capsid by several orders of magnitude from minutes to hours. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover the mechanisms that underlie the unusually high stability of mature capsids in complex with IP6. We find that capsid hexamers and pentamers have differential binding modes for IP6. Ligand density calculations show three sites of interaction with IP6 including at a known capsid inhibitor binding pocket. Free energy calculations demonstrate that IP6 preferentially stabilizes pentamers over hexamers to enhance fullerene modes of assembly. These results elucidate the molecular role of IP6 in stabilizing and assembling the retroviral capsid.;https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc6465;9.6;15.0;25.2;;;;;

Therapy associated with HIV has led to emergence of multidrug resistance and toxicity. Thus, the development of a potent, affordable and safe anti-HIV drug is a global concern. Among the different targets developed, inhibition of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRT) is found to be effective and promising. Etravirine, efavirenz, nevirapine, rilpivirine and delavirdine are the marketed NNRTIs available. This study is focused on computational prediction of hit molecules as well as repurposing of various FDA-approved drugs as potential NNRTIs. A synthetic database from ZINCpharmer, publicly available natural databases of coumarins, chromones and chalcones, and two databases of FDA-approved drugs for repurposing were screened to check for the possibility of these compounds to possess anti-HIV activity. Study utilizes a structure-based approach with the generated pharmacophore of target protein (PDB ID: 3MEC), screening of selected datasets is carried out using the Phase tool of Schrodinger. The top filtered compounds with good fitness score were proceeded to molecular docking studies to study their binding affinity to the target. Energy-based calculations using Prime MM-GBSA of Schrodinger was performed to determine free binding energy of the complexes. Prediction of pharmacokinetic parameters of top compounds is further carried out and reported. All the results obtained from different databases are compiled, interpreted and five molecules were subjected to molecular dynamic studies to further confirm the prediction and identified hit molecules for in vitro screening as potential NNRTIs.

Cu is involved in the functions of critical immune cells such as T helper cells, B cells, neutrophils natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages. These blood cells are involved in the killing of infectious microbes, in cell-mediated immunity and the production of specific antibodies against the pathogens. Cu-deficient humans show an exceptional susceptibility to infections due to the decreased number and function of these blood cells. Besides, Cu can kill several infectious viruses such as bronchitis virus, poliovirus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1), other enveloped or nonenveloped, single- or double-stranded DNA and RNA viruses. Moreover, Cu has the potent capacity of contact killing of several viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Since the current outbreak of the COVID-19 continues to develop, and there is no vaccine or drugs are currently available, the critical option is now to make the immune system competent to fight against the SARS-CoV-2. Based on available data, we hypothesize that enrichment of plasma copper levels will boost both the innate and adaptive immunity in people. Moreover, owing to its potent antiviral activities, Cu may also act as a preventive and therapeutic regime against COVID-19.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306987720308136;2.2;2.1;2.2;;S0306987720308136;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0306987720308136;;

Methods Patients under combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) with fully suppressed HIV plasma viral load (pVL) >24 months–whereof >6 months on an NVP- containing regimen—were switched to oral NVP plus 3TC for 24 weeks. Patients could then decide whether to continue DT or return to the previous cART. HIV pVL was monitored monthly until week 144. The primary outcome was confirmed viral failure (RNA >100 copies/ml). Low-level detection of HIV-RNA in plasma was compared in each patient with pre-study viral load measurements. Results Twenty patients were included, switched to DT and all completed week 24. One patient decided thereafter to discontinue study participation for personal reasons. After a total of 144 observation weeks, none of the patients failed. The frequency of low- level HIV-RNA detection was not different from the period before randomization. Conclusions Our findings are surprising but given the nature of a proof-of-concept study, the results do not support the use of this dual regimen. However, as this dual HIV maintenance strategy was feasible and effective, over a period of 144 weeks, we suggest NVP plus 3TC warrants further evaluation as potential maintenance option in patients tolerating nevirapine. A properly sized multicentre non-inferiority trial is ongoing to further evaluate the value of this DT maintenance strategy.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237770;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

Methods: Fifteen participants who initiated ART at AHI were randomized to vorinostat/hydroxychloroquine/ maraviroc (VHM) plus ART (n ¼ 10) or ART alone (n ¼ 5). The VHM arm received three 14-day vorinostat cycles within 10 weeks before TI. ART was resumed for plasma viral load (VL) > 1,000 HIV RNA copies/mL. Primary outcome was proportion of participants on VHM þ ART versus ART only with VL < 50 copies/mL for 24 weeks after TI. Results: Fifteen participants on ART (median: 178 weeks: range 79–295) enrolled. Two on VHM þ ART experienced serious adverse events. Fourteen participants underwent TI; all experienced VL rebound with no difference in time between arms: VHM þ ART (n ¼ 9) median: 4 weeks and ART only (n ¼ 5) median: 5 weeks. VHM induced a 2.2-fold increase in VL (p ¼ 0.008) by single-copy HIV RNA assay after the first cycle. Neopterin levels increased significantly following the first two cycles.

Karger AG, Basel.Classical antiviral restriction factors promote cellular immunity by their ability to interfere with virus replication and induction of their expression by proinflammatory cytokines such as interferons. The serine incorporator proteins SERINC3 and SERINC5 potently reduce the infectivity of HIV-1 particles when overexpressed, and RNA interference or knockout approaches in T cells have indicated antiviral activity also of the endogenous proteins. Due to lack of reagents for detection of endogenous SERINC proteins, it is still unclear whether SERINC3/5 are expressed to functionally relevant levels in different primary target cells of HIV infection and how the expression levels of these innate immunity factors are regulated. In the current study, analysis of SERINC3/5 mRNA steady-state levels in primary lymphoid and monocyte-derived cells revealed selective induction of their expression upon differentiation of myeloid cells. Contrary to classical antiviral restriction factors, various antiviral -interferon subtypes and proinflammatory interleukins had no effect on SERINC levels, which were also not dysregulated in CD4+ T cells and monocytes isolated from patients with chronic HIV-1 infection. Notably, HIV-1 particles produced by terminally differentiated monocyte-derived macrophages with high SERINC5 expression, but not by low-expressing monocytes, showed a Nef-dependent infectivity defect. Overall, these findings suggest endogenous expression of SERINC5 to antivirally active levels in macrophages. Our results classify SERINC5 as an unconventional HIV-1 restriction factor whose expression is specifically induced upon differentiation of cells towards the myeloid lineage.;https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/504888;8.4;6.9;8.4;1662811X;;;;

All Rights Reserved.Autophagy is a highly conserved recycling pathway that promotes cell survival during periods of stress. We previously reported that induction of autophagy through the inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) inhibits HIV replication in human macrophages and CD4+ T lymphocytes (T cells). However, the inhibition of MTOR has modulatory effects beyond autophagy that might affect viral replication. Here, we examined the effect on HIV replication of trehalose, a nontoxic, nonreducing disaccharide that induces autophagy through an MTOR-independent mechanism. Treatment of HIV-infected macrophages and T cells with trehalose inhibited infection in a dose-dependent manner. Uninfected and HIV-infected macrophages and T cells treated with trehalose exhibited increased markers of autophagy, including LC3B lipidation with further accumulation following bafilomycin A1 treatment, and increased levels of LAMP1, LAMP2, and RAB7 proteins required for lysosomal biogenesis and fusion. Moreover, the inhibition of HIV by trehalose was significantly reduced by knockdown of ATG5. Additionally, trehalose downregulated the expression of C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in T cells and CD4 in both T cells and macrophages, which reduced HIV entry in these cells. Our data demonstrate that the naturally occurring sugar trehalose at doses safely achieved in humans inhibits HIV through two mechanisms: (i) decreased entry through the downregulation of CCR5 in T cells and decreased CD4 expression in both T cells and macrophages and (ii) degradation of intracellular HIV through the induction of MTOR-independent autophagy. These findings demonstrate that cellular mechanisms can be modulated to inhibit HIV entry and intracellular replication using a naturally occurring, nontoxic sugar. IMPORTANCE Induction of autophagy through inhibition of MTOR has been shown to inhibit HIV replication. However, inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) has cellular effects that may alter HIV infection through other mechanisms. Here, we examined the HIV-inhibitory effects of the MTOR-independent inducer of autophagy, trehalose. Of note, we identified that in addition to the inhibition of the intracellular replication of HIV by autophagy, trehalose decreased viral entry in human primary macrophages and CD4+ T cells through the downregulation of C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in T cells and CD4 in both T cells and macrophages. Thus, we showed that trehalose uniquely inhibits HIV replication through inhibition of viral entry and intracellular degradation in the two most important target cells for HIV infection.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/17/e00237-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

All rights reserved.Background: COVID-19 and its social responses threaten the health of people living with HIV. We conducted a rapid-response interview to assess COVID-19 protective behaviors of people living with HIV and the impact of their responses on HIV-related health care. Method: Men and women living with HIV (N = 162) aged 20-37 years participating in a longitudinal study of HIV treatment and care completed routine study measures and an assessment of COVID-19-related experiences. Results: At baseline, most participants demonstrated HIV viremia, markers indicative of renal disorders, and biologically confirmed substance use. At follow-up, in the first month of responding to COVID-19, engaging in more social distancing behaviors was related to difficulty accessing food and medications and increased cancelation of health care appointments, both by self and providers. We observed antiretroviral therapy adherence had improved during the initial month of COVID-19 response. Conclusions: Factors that may pose added risk for COVID-19 severity were prevalent among people living with HIV, and those with greater risk factors did not practice more COVID-19 protective behaviors. Social distancing and other practices intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 interfered with HIV care, and impeded access to food and medications, although an immediate adverse impact on medication adherence was not evident. These results suggest social responses to COVID-19 adversely impacted the health care of people living with HIV, supporting continued monitoring to determine the long-term effects of co-occurring HIV and COVID-19 pandemics.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAI.0000000000002414;6.9;7.0;6.4;15254135;;;;

A key function of Nef is to remove the CD4 receptor from the cell surface by hijacking clathrin- and adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2)-dependent endocytosis. However, exactly how Nef does this has been elusive. Here, we describe the underlying mechanism as revealed by a 3.0-Å crystal structure of a fusion protein comprising Nef and the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 bound to the tetrameric AP2 complex. An intricate combination of conformational changes occurs in both Nef and AP2 to enable CD4 binding and downregulation. A pocket on Nef previously identified as crucial for recruiting class I MHC is also responsible for recruiting CD4, revealing a potential approach to inhibit two of Nef’s activities and sensitize the virus to immune clearance.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-020-0463-z;20.9;20.5;19.1;15459993;;;;

METHODS: From a cohort of 520 HIV-infected subjects treated with lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir monotherapy, we retrospectively identified nine patients with VF. We sequenced the HIV-1 Gag-protease region and generated clonal virus from plasma samples. We characterized phenotypically clonal variants in terms of replicative capacity and susceptibility to PIs. Also, we used VESPA to identify signature mutations and 3D molecular modelling information to detect conformational changes in the Gag region. RESULTS: All subjects analysed harboured Gag-associated polymorphisms in the absence of resistance mutations in the protease gene. Most Gag changes occurred outside Gag cleavage sites. VESPA analyses identified K95R and R286K (P < 0.01) as signature mutations in Gag present at VF. In one out of four patients with clonal analysis available, we identified clonal variants with high replicative capacity and 8- to 13-fold reduction in darunavir susceptibility. These clonal variants harboured K95R, R286K and additional mutations in Gag. Low susceptibility to darunavir was dependent on the Gag sequence context. All other clonal variants analysed preserved drug susceptibility and virus replicative capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Gag mutations may reduce darunavir susceptibility in the absence of protease mutations while preserving viral fitness. This effect is Gag-sequence context dependent and may occur during boosted PI failure.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/9/2535/5858390;8.7;7.7;8.3;;;;;

Published by Oxford University Press, on behalf of the Society of Systematic Biologists.Population structure influences genealogical patterns, however, data pertaining to how populations are structured are often unavailable or not directly observable. Inference of population structure is highly important in molecular epidemiology where pathogen phylogenetics is increasingly used to infer transmission patterns and detect outbreaks. Discrepancies between observed and idealized genealogies, such as those generated by the coalescent process, can be quantified, and where significant differences occur, may reveal the action of natural selection, host population structure, or other demographic and epidemiological heterogeneities. We have developed a fast non-parametric statistical test for detection of cryptic population structure in time-scaled phylogenetic trees. The test is based on contrasting estimated phylogenies with the theoretically expected phylodynamic ordering of common ancestors in two clades within a coalescent framework. These statistical tests have also motivated the development of algorithms which can be used to quickly screen a phylogenetic tree for clades which are likely to share a distinct demographic or epidemiological history. Epidemiological applications include identification of outbreaks in vulnerable host populations or rapid expansion of genotypes with a fitness advantage. To demonstrate the utility of these methods for outbreak detection, we applied the new methods to large phylogenies reconstructed from thousands of HIV-1 partial pol sequences. This revealed the presence of clades which had grown rapidly in the recent past and was significantly concentrated in young men, suggesting recent and rapid transmission in that group. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of these methods for the study of antimicrobial resistance, we applied the new methods to a large phylogeny reconstructed from whole genome Neisseria gonorrhoeae sequences. We find that population structure detected using these methods closely overlaps with the appearance and expansion of mutations conferring antimicrobial resistance.

All Rights Reserved.HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) is a barrier to sustained virologic suppression in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Point mutation assays targeting priority drug resistance mutations (DRMs) are being evaluated to improve access to HIVDR testing. In a cross-sectional study (June 2018 to September 2019), we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of a simple and rapid HIVDR assay (the pan-degenerate amplification and adaptation [PANDAA] assay targeting the mutations K65R, K103NS, M184VI, Y181C, and G190A) compared to Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Plasma samples from adolescents and young adults (aged 10 to 24 years) failing antiretroviral therapy (viral load, >1,000 copies/ml on 2 consecutive occasions 1 month apart) were analyzed. Sensitivity and specificity of the PANDAA assay were determined by a proprietary application designed by Aldatu Biosciences. Agreement between genotyping methods was evaluated using Cohen's kappa coefficient. One hundred fifty samples previously characterized by Sanger sequencing were evaluated using PANDAA. For all DRMs detected, PANDAA showed a sensitivity and specificity of 98% and 94%, respectively. For nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor DRMs, sensitivity and specificity were 98% (95% confidence interval [CI], 92% to 100%) and 100% (94% to 100%), respectively. For non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor DRMs, sensitivity and specificity were 100% (97% to 100%) and 76% (61% to 87%), respectively. PANDAA showed strong agreement with Sanger sequencing for K65R, K103NS, M184VI, and G190A (kappa > 0.85) and substantial agreement for Y181C (kappa = 0.720). Of the 21 false-positive samples genotyped by PANDAA, only 6 (29%) were identified as low-abundance variants by NGS. With the high sensitivity and specificity to detect major DRMs, PANDAA could represent a simple and rapid alternative HIVDR assay in LMICs.;https://jcm.asm.org/content/58/9/e01045-20;8.0;8.2;8.6;00951137;;;;

All Rights Reserved.Apolipoprotein B editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide 3 (APOBEC3) family members are cytidine deaminases that play important roles in intrinsic responses to retrovirus infection. Complex retroviruses like human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encode the viral infectivity factor (Vif) protein to counteract APOBEC3 proteins. Vif induces degradation of APOBEC3G and other APOBEC3 proteins and thereby prevents their packaging into virions. It is not known if murine leukemia virus (MLV) encodes a Vif-like protein. Here, we show that the MLV P50 protein, produced from an alternatively spliced gag RNA, interacts with the C terminus of mouse APOBEC3 and prevents its packaging without causing its degradation. By infecting APOBEC3 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice with Friend or Moloney MLV P50-deficient viruses, we found that APOBEC3 restricts the mutant viruses more than WT viruses in vivo. Replication of P50-mutant viruses in an APOBEC3-expressing stable cell line was also much slower than that of WT viruses, and over-expressing P50 in this cell line enhanced mutant virus replication. Thus, MLV encodes a protein, P50, that overcomes APOBEC3 restriction by preventing its packaging into virions. IMPORTANCE MLV has existed in mice for at least a million years, in spite of the existence of host restriction factors that block infection. Although MLV is considered a simple retrovirus compared to lentiviruses, it does encode proteins generated from alternatively spliced RNAs. Here, we show that P50, generated from an alternatively spliced RNA encoded in gag, counteracts APOBEC3 by blocking its packaging. MLV also encodes a protein, glycoGag, that increases capsid stability and limits APOBEC3 access to the reverse transcription complex (RTC). Thus, MLV has evolved multiple means of preventing APOBEC3 from blocking infection, explaining its survival as an infectious pathogen in mice.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/18/e00032-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

Here, we report the atomic-resolution structure of capsid protein (CA) tubes, determined by magic-angle spinning NMR and data-guided molecular dynamics simulations. Functionally important regions, including the NTD -hairpin, the cyclophilin A-binding loop, residues in the hexamer central pore, and the NTD-CTD linker region, are well defined. The structure of individual CA chains, their arrangement in the pseudo-hexameric units of the tube and the inter-hexamer interfaces are consistent with those in intact capsids and substantially different from the organization in crystal structures, which feature flat hexamers. The inherent curvature in the CA tubes is controlled by conformational variability of residues in the linker region and of dimer and trimer interfaces. The present structure reveals atomic-level detail in capsid architecture and provides important guidance for the design of novel capsid inhibitors.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-020-0489-2;20.9;20.5;19.1;15459993;;;;

In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the HIV-1 confirmatory results tested by western blot (WB) or recombination immunoblot assay (RIBA) in Wuhan, 2012–2018, to access the profiles of HIV-1 specific antibodies. A total of 14432 HIV-suspected serum or plasma samples collected from local hospitals and other HIV screening laboratories were further screened by two 4th generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits in our laboratory, of which 11068 specimens (76.69%) had at least one positive ELISA result and thereby were finally confirmed with WB or RIBA. RIBA had identified 652 (81.09%) positive and 13 (1.62%) indeterminate cases from July 1, 2014 to January 7, 2015, while WB had identified 8358 (81.43%) positive and 643 (6.26%) indeterminate cases in the other times during 2012–2018. The indeterminate rate of WB was significant higher than that of RIBA (p<0.001). Although the number of HIV-1 infected subjects increased significantly from 2012 (n = 911) to 2018 (n = 1578), the positive rate of HIV-1 antibodies decreased markedly from 70.08% in 2012 to 58.79% in 2018 (p<0.001). The most commonly observed antibody profile was gp160+gp120+p66 +(p55+)p51+gp41+p31+p24+p17+ (4131, 49.43%) for WB-MP and gp160+gp120+gp41 +p31+p24+p17+ (382, 58.59%) for RIBA-WANTAI, and the absence of reactivity to three possible serologic markers for recent HIV-1 infection, p31, p66, and p51, increased significantly from 2012 to 2018, with the overall rate of 17.03%, 9.40%, and 15.15%, respectively. The suspected acute HIV-1 infection was also observed to be increased in recent years, with an overall rate of 1.00%. Our results indicated the detection rate had decreased for HIV-1 infection, but increased for suspected recent and acute HIV-1 infection during 2012–2018, reflecting the efforts of intervention among high risk population.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238282;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

Although the underlying mechanisms are not known, they may involve neurotoxic HIV-1 proteins. Methods: We assessed the influence of the neurotoxic HIV-1 regulatory protein, Tat, on inflammatory and neuropathic nociceptive behaviours using transgenic male and female mice that conditionally expressed (or did not express) HIV-1 Tat1-86 in fibrillary acidic protein-expressing glia in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Results: Tat induction significantly attenuated the time spent paw-licking following formalin injection (2.5%, i.pl.) in both male and female mice. However, significant sex differences were observed in the onset and magnitude of inflammation and sensory sensitivity following complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) injection (10%, i.pl.) after Tat activation. Unlike female mice, male mice showed a significant attenuation of paw swelling and an absence of mechanical/thermal hypersensitivity in response to CFA after Tat induction. Male Tat(+) mice also showed accelerated recovery from chronic constrictive nerve injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity compared to female Tat(+) mice. Morphine (3.2 mg/kg) fully reversed CCI-induced mechanical hypersensitivity in female Tat() mice, but not in Tat(+) females. Conclusions: The ability of Tat to decrease oedema, paw swelling, and limit allodynia suggests a sequel of events in which Tat-induced functional deficits precede the onset of mechanical hypersensitivity.

HIV-1 Tat appears to directly contribute to HIV sensory neuropathy and reveals sex differences in HIV responsiveness and/or the underlying peripheral neuroinflammatory and nociceptive mechanisms.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejp.1618;5.7;5.7;6.2;10903801;;;;

Here, we discuss the provenance and characteristics of currently relevant SHIVs, novel technical advances, recent discoveries enabled by SHIV challenge studies, and the continued development of SHIVs for persistence and cure experiments. RECENT FINDINGS: SHIV SF162P3, SHIV AD8EO, and transmitter/founder SHIVs with Env375 mutations are now common reagents in nonhuman primate studies, with increased use and validation establishing their properties and potential applications. Genetic barcoding of SIV and SHIV, which allows tracing of individual lineages and elucidation of viral kinetics from transmission through latency has expanded the experimental capacity of SHIV models. SHIV challenge studies have determined the neutralizing antibody titers that correlate with protection for passive and active immunization and enabled complementary human and nonhuman primate studies of vaccine development. SHIV models of latency continue to evolve, aided by descriptions of SHIV persistence on ART and the proviral landscape. SUMMARY: Recent advances and more thorough characterization of SHIVs allow for expanded applications and greater confidence in experimental results.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/COH.0000000000000645;7.5;7.2;7.8;;;;;

The delay term represents the latent period between the time that the target cells are contacted by the virus and the time the virions penetrated into the cells. To understand the analysis of our proposed model, the Rouths-Hurwiz criterion and general theory of delay differential equations are used. It is shown that the infection free equilibrium and the chronic-infection equilibrium are locally as well as globally asymptotically stable, under some conditions on the basic reproductive number R0. Furthermore, the obtained results show that the value of R0can be decreased by increasing the delay. Therefore, any drugs that can prolong the latent period will help to control the HIV-1 infection.;https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/gmj/27/3/article-p331.xml;0.7;0.9;1.1;1072947X;;;;

We verified whether natural resistance to HIV-1 infection in HIV-1-exposed seronegative (HESN) individuals is at least partially mediated by particularities in sterol biosynthesis. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) isolated from 15 sexually exposed HESN and 15 healthy controls were in vitro HIV-1-infected and analyzed for: percentage of IFN-producing plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs); cholesterol signaling and inflammatory response RNA expression; resistance to HIV-1 infection. MDMs from five healthy controls were in vitro HIV-1-infected in the absence/presence of exogenously added 25HC. RESULTS: IFN-producing pDCs were augmented in HESN compared with healthy controls both in unstimulated and in in vitro HIV-1-infected PBMCs (P < 0.001). An increased expression of CH25H and of a number of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism (ABCA1, ABCG1, CYP7B1, LXR, OSBP, PPAR, SCARB1) was observed as well; this, was associated with a reduced susceptibility to in-vitro HIV-1-infection of PBMCs and MDMs (P < 0.01). Notably, addition of 25HC to MDMs resulted in increased cholesterol efflux and augmented resistance to in-vitro HIV-1-infection. CONCLUSION: Results herein show that in HESN sterol metabolism might be particularly efficient. This could be related to the activation of the IFN pathway and results into a reduced susceptibility to in-vitro HIV-1 infection. These results suggest a possible basis for therapeutic interventions to modulate HIV-1 infection.";https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAD.0000000000002591;8.8;7.1;7.5;;;;;

Three HIV-infected patients came to the Oral Medicine Clinic with similar chief complaints of asymptomatic white lesions on the tongue. All patients were diagnosed with suspected OHL and oral thrush also in the first patient. A multiplex PCR DNA microarray was performed to detect EBV DNA in saliva collected by spitting method. All saliva samples showed positive results for EBV DNA, and the definitive diagnosis of OHL was made. Resolution of lesions was found at 1- to 2-month follow-up after treatment with application of acyclovir 5% cream 5 times daily. Additionally, anti-fungal treatment was given to the first patient and anti-retroviral treatment to the first and second patients. EBV is mostly transmitted by asymptomatic shedding into saliva. Therefore, the detection of salivary EBV DNA is useful in establishing a definitive diagnosis of OHL allowing more effective treatment for both HIV-infected patients receiving ART and treatment-naïve patients at any CD4 + count.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/odi.13400;4.2;4.0;3.9;1354523X;;;;

Therapeutic vaccines have been commonly used to enhance and/or recall pre-existing HIV-1-specific cell-mediated immune responses aiming to suppress virus replication. The current success of immune checkpoint blockers in cancer therapy renders them very attractive to use in HIV-1 infected individuals with the objective to preserve the function of HIV-1-specific T cells from exhaustion and presumably target the persistent cellular reservoir. The major latest advances in our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for virus reactivation during therapy-suppressed individuals provide the scientific basis for future combinatorial therapeutic vaccine development.;https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/8/3/419;6.5;7.5;4.5;;;;;

However, the underlying mechanism for the class II phenotype is not known. Here we demonstrate that all tested class II IN substitutions compromised IN-RNA binding in virions by one of three distinct mechanisms: i) markedly reducing IN levels thus precluding formation of IN complexes with viral RNA; ii) adversely affecting functional IN multimerization and consequently impairing IN binding to viral RNA; iii) directly compromising IN-RNA interactions without substantially affecting IN levels or functional IN multimerization. Inhibition of IN-RNA interactions resulted in mislocalization of the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes outside the capsid lattice, which led to premature degradation of the viral genome and IN in target cells. Collectively, our studies uncover causal mechanisms for the class II phenotype and highlight an essential role of IN-RNA interactions for accurate virion maturation.";https://elifesciences.org/articles/54311;10.0;10.8;10.8;;;;;

Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe monosialodihexosylganglioside, GM3, and its binding to CD169 (Siglec-1) have been indicated as key factors in the glycoprotein-independent sequestration of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) in virus-containing compartments (VCCs) in myeloid cells. Here, lipid-wrapped polymer nanoparticles (NPs) are applied as a virus-mimicking model to characterize the effect of core stiffness on NP uptake and intracellular fate triggered by GM3-CD169 binding in macrophages. GM3-functionalized lipid-wrapped NPs are assembled with poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) as well as with low and high molecular weight polylactic acid (PLAlMW and PLAhMW) cores. The NPs have an average diameter of 146 ± 17 nm and comparable surface properties defined by the self-assembled lipid layer. Due to differences in the glass transition temperature, the Young's modulus (E) differs substantially under physiological conditions between PLGA (EPLGA = 60 ± 32 MPa), PLAlMW (EPLAlMW = 86 ± 25 MPa), and PLAhMW (EPLAhMW = 1.41 ± 0.67 GPa) NPs. Only the stiff GM3-presenting PLAhMW NPs but not the softer PLGA or PLAlMW NPs avoid a lysosomal pathway and localize in tetraspanin (CD9)-positive compartments that resemble VCCs. These observations suggest that GM3-CD169-induced sequestration of NPs in nonlysosomal compartments is not entirely determined by ligand–receptor interactions but also depends on core stiffness.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202000649;11.2;14.6;15.5;;;;;

Here, we review broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies (bNAbs) combined with latency-reversing agents (LRAs) or immune modulators as strategy for achieving long-term HIV-1 remission. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical trials testing the effect of a single intervention such as a LRA 'shock and kill', immune modulator or bNAbs among HIV-1 infected individuals on long-term suppressive ART have not lead to long-term HIV-1 remission when ART is stopped. Novel combinations of interventions designed to eliminate infected cells and enhance immune-effector functions are being investigated. Findings in nonhuman primates (NHPs) of such combinations are very promising and clinical trials are now ongoing. These trials will provide the first indication of the efficacy of combinations of bNAbs and LRA or immune modulators for achieving durable HIV-1 remission. SUMMARY: bNAbs facilitate the elimination of HIV-1 infected cells and boost immune responses. Preclinical findings show that these effects can be harnessed by simultaneous administration of LRAs or immune modulators such as Toll-like receptor agonists. The clinical success of such combination strategies may be impacted by factors such as immune exhaustion, bNAbs sensitivity as well as the pharmacodynamics of the investigational compounds.";https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/COH.0000000000000641;7.5;7.2;7.8;;;;;

DESIGN: Twelve postmortem brain areas from three cases of possible or certain HIV-encephalopathy were analyzed. METHODS: After amplification of the reverse transcriptase and the V3 loop region of the gp120 protein, ultradeep sequencing was performed with Illumina technology. Phylogenetic analysis was performed with Fastree v2.1 using the generalized time-reversible (GTR) model. Identification of resistant viral variants was performed on Geneious software, according to HIV-1 genotypic drug resistance interpretation's algorithms, 2018 administered by the French Agency for Research on AIDS and Viral Hepatitis. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis revealed significant inter-regional and intra-regional diversity reflecting persistent HIV-1 viral replication in the different brain areas. Although some cerebral regions shared HIV-variants, most of them harbored a specific HIV-subpopulation reflecting HIV compartmentalization in the central nervous system. Furthermore, proportion and distribution of resistance mutations to nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors differed among different brain areas of the same case suggesting that penetration of antiretroviral treatment may differ from one compartment to another.

Increasing evidence supports the kidney as such a reservoir. Previous work demonstrated that HIV-1 infected CD4 T-cells transfer virus to renal tubule epithelial (RTE) cells through cell-to-cell contact. In addition to CD4 T cells, macrophages represent the other major target of HIV-1. Renal macrophages induce and regulate inflammatory responses and are critical to homeostatic regulation of the kidney environment. Combined with their ability to harbour virus, macrophages may also play an important role in the spread of HIV-1 infection in the kidney. DESIGN AND METHODS: Multiparametric histochemistry analysis was performed on kidney biopsies from individuals with HIV-1 associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Primary monocyte-derived macrophages were infected with a GFP-expressing replication competent HIV-1. HIV-1 transfer from macrophages to RTE cells was carried out in a coculture system and evaluated by fluorescence-microscopy and flow-cytometry. Live imaging was performed to assess the fate of HIV-1 infected RTE cells over time. RESULTS: We show that macrophages are abundantly present in the renal inflammatory infiltrate of individuals with HIVAN. We observed contact-dependent HIV-1 transfer from infected macrophages to both primary and immortalized renal cells. Live imaging of HIV-1 infected RTE cells revealed four different fates: proliferation, hypertrophy, latency and cell death. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that macrophages may play a role in the dissemination of HIV-1 in the kidney and that proliferation of infected renal cells may contribute to HIV-1 persistence in this compartment.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAD.0000000000002589;8.8;7.1;7.5;;;;;

We assessed the impact of different antiretroviral (ARV) regimens on plasma PCSK9 levels as well as plasma lipids, systemic inflammation and immunovirological parameters. Methods: Eighty HIV-positive ARV therapy (ART)-naïve PLWH and 40 uninfected controls were retrospectively enrolled. At baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months after ART initiation, plasma PCSK9 levels, lipids, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4 T-cell count were measured. Results: Baseline PCSK9 levels were significantly more elevated in PLWH and were associated with HIV-1 RNA levels (P < 0.001), CD4 T-cell counts (P < 0.001), triglycerides (P < 0.001) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (P < 0.001), but not with total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) levels. The prescription of ART was paralleled by significant decreases in plasma PCSK9 and hs-CRP levels, and increases in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoprotein(a), independent of regimen. Conclusions: PCSK9 levels, along with systemic inflammation, were progressively reduced following the initiation of an effective ART. However, at the end of the study PCSK9 levels remained higher than in controls and did not correlate with any of the lipid variables.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hiv.12884;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;;

Here, we examined whether antibodies targeting the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins interfere with the transcytosis of virions across the human BBB endothelium. We found that although the viral envelope spike gp160 is required for optimal endothelial cell endocytosis, no anti-gp160 antibodies blocked the BBB transcytosis of HIV-1 in vitro. Instead, both free viruses and those in complex with antibodies transited across endothelial cells in the BBB model, as observed by confocal microscopy. HIV-1 infectious capacity was considerably altered by the transcytosis process but still detectable, even in the presence of nonneutralizing antibodies. Only virions bound by neutralizing antibodies lacked posttranscytosis infectivity. Overall, our data support the role of neutralizing antibodies in protecting susceptible brain cells from HIV-1 infection despite their inability to inhibit viral BBB endocytic transport. IMPORTANCE HIV-1 can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to penetrate the brain and infect target cells, causing neurocognitive disorders as a result of neuroinflammation and brain damage. The HIV-1 envelope spike gp160 is partially required for viral transcytosis across the BBB endothelium. But do antibodies developing in infected individuals and targeting the HIV-1 gp160 glycoproteins block HIV-1 transcytosis through the BBB? We addressed this issue and discovered that anti-gp160 antibodies do not block HIV-1 transport; instead, free viruses and those in complex with antibodies can transit across BBB endothelial cells. Importantly, we found that only neutralizing antibodies could inhibit posttranscytosis viral infectivity, highlighting their ability to protect susceptible brain cells from HIV-1 infection.";https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/5/e02424-20;11.2;10.5;9.9;21612129;;;;

Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. All rights reservedOral and genital mucosal epithelia are multistratified epithelial barriers with well-developed tight and adherens junctions. These barriers serve as the first line of defense against many pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV interaction with the surface of mucosal epithelial cells, however, may activate transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-) and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. When activated, these pathways may lead to the disruption of epithelial junctions and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). HIV-induced impairment of the mucosal barrier may facilitate the spread of pathogenic viral, bacterial, fungal, and other infectious agents. HIV-induced EMT promotes highly motile/migratory cells. In oral and genital mucosa, if EMT occurs within a human papillomavirus (HPV)-infected premalignant or malignant cell environment, the HPV-associated neoplastic process could be accelerated by promoting viral invasion of malignant cells. HIV also internalizes into oral and genital mucosal epithelial cells. The majority (90%) of internalized virions do not cross the epithelium, but are retained in endosomal compartments for several days. These sequestered virions are infectious. Upon interaction with activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD4+ T lymphocytes, epithelial cells containing the virus can be transferred. The induction of HIV-1 release and the cell-to-cell spread of virus from epithelial cells to lymphocytes is mediated by interaction of lymphocyte receptor function-associated antigen-1 with the epithelial cell receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Thus, mucosal epithelial cells may serve as a transient reservoir for HIV, which could play a critical role in viral transmission.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/odi.13387;4.2;4.0;3.9;1354523X;;;;

Several studies in SIV-infected macaques suggest that CD8+ T cells may also decrease virus production by suppressing viral transcription. Here, we show that non-HIV-specific, TCR-activated non-cytolytic CD8+ T cells suppress HIV transcription via a virus- and MHC-independent immunoregulatory mechanism that modulates CD4+ T cell proliferation and activation. We also demonstrate that this CD8+ T cell-mediated effect promotes the survival of infected CD4+ T cells harboring integrated, inducible virus. Finally, we used RNA sequencing and secretome analyses to identify candidate cellular pathways that are involved in the virus-silencing mediated by these CD8+ T cells. This study characterizes a previously undescribed mechanism of immune-mediated HIV silencing that may be involved in the establishment and maintenance of the reservoir under antiretroviral therapy and therefore represent a major obstacle to HIV eradication.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008821;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

The IAVI protocol C cohort of discordant couples, female sex workers, other heterosexuals and men who have sex with men (MSM) present varying risks of HIV infection, diverse HIV-1 subtypes and represent a unique opportunity to characterize transmitted/founder viruses (TF) where disease outcome is known. To identify the TF, the HIV-1 repertoire of 38 MSM participants' samples was sequenced close to transmission (median 21 days post infection, IQR 18-41) and assessment of multivariant infection done. Patient derived gag genes were cloned into an NL4.3 provirus to generate chimeric viruses which were characterized for replicative capacity (RC). Finally, an evaluation of how the TF virus predicted disease progression and modified the immune response at both acute and chronic HIV-1 infection was done. There was higher prevalence of multivariant infection compared with previously described heterosexual cohorts. A link was identified between multivariant infection and replicative capacity conferred by gag, whereby TF gag tended to be of lower replicative capacity in multivariant infection (p = 0.02) suggesting an overall lowering of fitness requirements during infection with multiple variants. Notwithstanding, multivariant infection was associated with rapid CD4+ T cell decline and perturbances in the CD4+ T cell and B cell compartments compared to single variant infection, which were reversible upon control of viremia. Strategies aimed at identifying and mitigating multivariant infection could contribute toward improving HIV-1 prognosis and this may involve strategies that tighten the stringency of the transmission bottleneck such as treatment of STI. Furthermore, the sequences and chimeric viruses help with TF based experimental vaccine immunogen design and can be used in functional assays to probe effective immune responses against TF.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008853;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.A vaccine will likely be one of the key tools for ending the HIV-1/AIDS epidemic by preventing HIV-1 spread within uninfected populations and achieving a cure for people living with HIV-1. The currently prevailing view of the vaccine field is to introduce protective antibodies, nevertheless, a vaccine to be effective may need to harness protective T cells. We postulated that focusing a T-cell response on the most vulnerable regions of the HIV-1 proteome while maximizing a perfect match between the vaccine and circulating viruses will control HIV-1 replication. We currently use a combination of replication-deficient simian (chimpanzee) adenovirus and poxvirus modified vaccinia virus Ankara to deliver bivalent conserved-mosaic immunogens to human volunteers. Here, we exploit the mRNA platform by designing tetravalent immunogens designated as HIVconsvM, and demonstrate that mRNA formulated in lipid nanoparticles induces potent, broad and polyfunctional T-cell responses in a pre-clinical model. These results support optimization and further development of this vaccine strategy in experimental medicine trials in humans.;https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/8/3/360;6.5;7.5;4.5;;;;;

Their susceptibility to HIV-1 infection is subject to variations from permissiveness to resistance depending on their origin, tissue localization, and polarization profile. This is in part due to the expression of regulatory microRNAs. Here, we identify two microRNA paralogs, microRNA 103 (miR-103) and miR-107, as regulators of CCR5 expression that are upregulated in noninfected bystander cells of HIV-1-infected-monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) cultures. Transfection of microRNA 103 mimics in MDMs reduced CCR5 expression levels and inhibited CCR5-dependent HIV-1 entry, whereas the corresponding antagomirs enhanced virus spread in HIV-infected MDMs. Treatment of MDMs with interleukin-1 (IL1) enhanced microRNA 103 expression, a condition that we found contributed to the reduction of CCR5 mRNA in IL-1-exposed MDMs. Interestingly, we show that the induction of miR-103/107 expression is part of a tumor suppressor p53 response triggered by secreted IL-1 that renders macrophages refractory to HIV-1 entry. In a more physiological context, the levels of microRNAs 103 and 107 were found enriched in tissue-resident colon macrophages of healthy donors and alveolar macrophages of individuals under antiretroviral therapy, conceivably contributing to their relative resistance to HIV-1 infection. Overall, these findings highlight the role of p53 in enforcing proinflammatory antiviral responses in macrophages, at least in part, through miR-103/107-mediated downmodulation of CCR5 expression and HIV-1 entry. IMPORTANCE Macrophages are heterogeneous immune cells that display varying susceptibilities to HIV-1 infection, in part due to the expression of small noncoding microRNAs involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression and silencing. Here, we identify microRNAs 103 and 107 as important p53-regulated effectors of the antiviral response triggered by the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 in macrophages. These microRNAs, which are enriched in colon macrophages of healthy donors and alveolar macrophages of HIV-infected individuals under antiretroviral therapy, act as inhibitors of HIV-1 entry through their capacity to downregulate the CCR5 coreceptor. These results highlight the important role played by miR-103/107 in modulating CCR5 expression and HIV-1 entry in macrophages. They further underscore a distinct function of the tumor suppressor p53 in enforcing proinflammatory antiviral responses in macrophages, thus providing insight into a cellular pathway that could be targeted to limit the establishment of viral reservoirs in these cells.;https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/5/e02314-20;11.2;10.5;9.9;21612129;;;;

As basic HIV research has informed the development of novel therapies, HIV inhibitors have been used as probes for investigating basic mechanisms of HIV-1 replication, transmission, and pathogenesis. This positive feedback cycle has led to the development of highly effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), which has helped stall the progression to AIDS, prolong lives, and reduce transmission of the virus. However, to combat the growing rates of virologic failure and toxicity associated with long-term therapy, it is important to diversify our repertoire of HIV-1 treatments by identifying compounds that block additional steps not targeted by current drugs. Most of the available therapeutics disrupt early events in the replication cycle, with the exception of the protease (PR) inhibitors, which act at the virus maturation step. HIV-1 maturation consists of a series of biochemical changes that facilitate the conversion of an immature, noninfectious particle to a mature infectious virion. These changes include proteolytic processing of the Gag polyprotein by the viral protease (PR), structural rearrangement of the capsid (CA) protein, and assembly of individual CA monomers into hexamers and pentamers that ultimately form the capsid. Here, we review the development and therapeutic potential of maturation inhibitors (MIs), an experimental class of anti-HIV-1 compounds with mechanisms of action distinct from those of the PR inhibitors. We emphasize the key insights into HIV-1 biology and structure that the study of MIs has provided. We will focus on three distinct groups of inhibitors that block HIV-1 maturation: (1) compounds that block the processing of the CA-spacer peptide 1 (SP1) cleavage intermediate, the original class of compounds to which the term MI was applied; (2) CA-binding inhibitors that disrupt capsid condensation; and (3) allosteric integrase inhibitors (ALLINIs) that block the packaging of the viral RNA genome into the condensing capsid during maturation. Although these three classes of compounds have distinct structures and mechanisms of action, they share the ability to block the formation of the condensed conical capsid, thereby blocking particle infectivity.";https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/9/940;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using latently infected primary T cells and Jurkat T-cell lines demonstrated that CBF-1 induces the establishment and maintenance of HIV latency by recruiting polycomb group (PcG/PRC) corepressor complexes or polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). Knockdown of CBF-1 resulted in the dissociation of PRCs corepressor complexes enhancing the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) at HIV LTR. Knockdown of certain components of PRC1 and PRC2 also led to the reactivation of latent proviruses.

Additionally, while cART has successfully suppressed peripheral viremia, cytotoxicity associated with the presence of viral Transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein in tissues such as the brain, remains a significant concern. Our previous study has demonstrated that both HIV-1 Tat as well as opiates such as morphine, can directly induce synaptic alterations via independent pathways. Herein, we demonstrate that exposure of astrocytes to HIV-1 protein Tat mediates the induction and release of extracellular vesicle (EV) microRNA-7 (miR-7) that is taken up by neurons, leading in turn, to downregulation of neuronal neuroligin 2 (NLGN2) and ultimately to synaptic alterations.

This function of IN has been well studied, and the knowledge gained has informed the design of small molecule inhibitors that now form key components of antiretroviral therapy regimens. Recent discoveries unveiled that IN has an under-studied yet equally vital second function in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. This involves IN binding to the viral RNA genome in virions, which is necessary for proper virion maturation and morphogenesis. Inhibition of IN binding to the viral RNA genome results in mislocalization of the viral genome inside the virus particle, and its premature exposure and degradation in target cells. The roles of IN in integration and virion morphogenesis share a number of common elements, including interaction with viral nucleic acids and assembly of higher-order IN multimers. Herein we describe these two functions of IN within the context of the HIV-1 life cycle, how IN binding to the viral genome is coordinated by the major structural protein, Gag, and discuss the value of targeting the second role of IN in virion morphogenesis.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/9/1005;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

Alternative reservoir quantification assays have been developed to circumvent limitations of the quantitative viral outgrowth assay. One such assay is tat/rev induced limiting dilution assay (TILDA), which measures the frequency of CD4+ T cells harboring inducible latent HIV-1 provirus. We modified pre-amplification reagents and conditions (TILDA v2.0) to improve assay execution and first internally validated assay performance using CD4+ T cells obtained from cART-suppressed HIV-1-infected individuals. Detection of tat/rev multiply spliced RNA was not altered by modifying pre-amplification conditions, confirming the robustness of the assay, and supporting the technique’s amenability to limited modifications to ensure better implementation for routine use in clinical studies of latent HIV-1 reservoirs. Furthermore, we cross-validated results of TILDA v2.0 and the original assay performed in two separate laboratories using samples from 15 HIV-1-infected individuals. TILDA and TILDA v2.0 showed a strong correlation (Lin’s Concordance Correlation Coefficient = 0.86). The low inter-laboratory variability between TILDAs performed at different institutes further supports use of TILDA for reservoir quantitation in multi-center interventional HIV-1 Cure trials.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/9/973;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

Strategies for HIV-1 cure have largely focused on latency reversing agents (LRAs) capable of reactivating and eliminating this viral reservoir. Previously investigated LRAs have largely failed to achieve a robust latency reversal sufficient for reduction of latent HIV pool or the potential of virus-free remission in the absence of treatment. Methods: We utilize a polyvalent virus-like particle (VLP) formulation called Activator Vector (ACT-VEC) to ‘shock’ provirus into transcriptional activity. Ex vivo co-culture experiments were used to evaluate the efficacy of ACT-VEC in relation to other LRAs in individuals diagnosed and treated during the acute stage of infection. IFN- ELISpot, qRT-PCR and Illumina MiSeq were used to evaluate antigenicity, latency reversal, and diversity of induced virus respectively. Findings: Using samples from HIV+ patients diagnosed and treated at acute/early infection, we demonstrate that ACT-VEC can reverse latency in HIV infected CD4 T cells to a greater extent than other major recall antigens as stimuli or even mitogens such as PMA/Iono. Furthermore, ACT-VEC activates more latent HIV-1 than clinically tested HDAC inhibitors or protein kinase C agonists. Interpretation: Taken together, these results show that ACT-VEC can induce HIV reactivation from latently infected CD4 T cells collected from participants on first line combined antiretroviral therapy for at least two years after being diagnosed and treated at acute/early stage of infection. These findings could provide guidance to possible targeted cure strategies and treatments.

In central nervous system (CNS), blood brain barrier (BBB) restricts the desired therapeutic responses due to inefficient targeting, release kinetics, and failure to reach therapeutic concentrations in the brain. Therefore, most potentially beneficial diagnostic and therapeutic agents are not able to reach to the brain upon systemic administration. Despite the existence of many invasive techniques to promote drug deliveries across BBB, novel strategies of drug delivery system which can cross BBB effectively are required, otherwise translation of novel neurotherapeutics from bench to bedside will be difficult to achieve. In this review, we briefly outline the existing and emerging strategies for CNS drug deliveries with a focus on potential and challenges of using extracellular vesicles (EVs) in CNS drug delivery system. EVs are emerging as a promising tool for therapeutic delivery owing to its favorable intrinsic features of biocompatibility, stability, stealth capacity, ability to overcome natural barriers and inherent homing capability. EVs are nanovesicles that allow cell-cell communication. The EVs-cargo reflects the physiological as well as the pathophysiological state of a cell. EVs are shown to play a role in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and dissemination, which contributes to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In the context of HIV-1 infection, this review also outlines the role of EVs in dissemination, challenges faced in EVs research in HIV-1 co-morbid conditions and potential of nanotechnologies, especially EVs in Neuro-AIDS.

Here, we quantify SERINC3 and SERINC5 internalization function for 339 Nef clones, representing the major pandemic HIV-1 group M subtypes A, B, C and D. We describe distinct subtype-associated hierarchies for Nef-mediated internalization of SERINC5, for which subtype B clones display the highest activities on average, and of SERINC3, for which subtype B clones display the lowest activities on average. We further identify Nef polymorphisms that modulate its ability to counteract SERINC proteins, including substitutions in the N-terminal domain that selectively impair SERINC3 internalization. Our findings demonstrate that the SERINC antagonism activities of HIV Nef differ markedly among major viral subtypes and between individual isolates within a subtype, suggesting that variation in these functions may contribute to global differences in viral pathogenesis.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008813;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

All Rights Reserved.The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer of gp120-gp41 heterodimers mediates virus entry into CD4-positive (CD4+) cells. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) has revealed that native Env on the surface of viruses predominantly exists in a pretriggered conformation (state 1) that is preferentially recognized by many broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Env is activated by binding receptor CD4, which drives transitions through a default intermediate conformation (state 2) into the three-CD4-bound open conformation (state 3). The application of smFRET to assess the conformational state of existing Env constructs and ligand complexes recently revealed that all current high-resolution structures correspond to downstream states 2 and 3. The structure of state 1, therefore, remains unknown. We sought to identify conditions whereby HIV-1 Env could be stabilized in the pretriggered state 1 for possible structural characterization. Shedding of gp120, known to severely complicate structural studies, can be prevented by using the uncleaved gp160JR-FL precursor with alterations in the protease cleavage site (R508S/R511S) or by introducing a disulfide bridge between gp120 and gp41 designated “SOS” (A501C/T605C). smFRET demonstrated that both shedding-preventing modifications shifted the conformational landscape of Env downstream toward states 2 and 3. However, both membrane-bound Env proteins on the surface of intact viruses remained conformationally dynamic, responsive to state-stabilizing ligands, and able to be stabilized in state 1 by specific ligands such as the Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) entry inhibitors. The here-described identification of state 1-stabilizing conditions may enable structural characterization of the state 1 conformation of HIV-1 Env. IMPORTANCE The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) opens in response to receptor CD4 binding from a pretriggered (state 1) conformation through a necessary intermediate to the three-CD4-bound conformation. The application of smFRET to test the conformational state of existing Env constructs and ligand complexes used for high-resolution structures recently revealed that they correspond to the downstream conformations. The structure of the pretriggered Env conformation, preferentially recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies, remains unknown. Here, we identify experimental conditions that stabilize membrane-bound and shedding-resistant virus Env trimers in state 1, potentially facilitating structural characterization of this unknown conformational state.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/17/e00597-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.A functional Human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) cure has been proposed as an alternative to antiretroviral treatment for life, and therapeutic vaccines represent one of the most promising approaches. The goal of therapeutic vaccination is to augment virus-specific immune responses that have an impact on HIV viral load dynamics. To date, the agreed feature to evaluate the effects of these therapeutic interventions is analytical antiretroviral treatment interruption (ATI), at least until we find a reliable biomarker that can predict viral control. Different host, immunologic, and virologic markers have been proposed as predictors of viral control during ATI after therapeutic interventions. This review describes the relevance of ATI and the different surrogate markers of virological control assessed in HIV therapeutic vaccine clinical trials.;https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/8/3/442;6.5;7.5;4.5;;;;;

Severe bacterial infections are the first cause of morbidity in people with human immunodeficiency virus (PWH). We aimed to assess their incidence and to analyze their determinants. Methods. We studied human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected individuals aged at least 15 years and prospectively followed between 2006 and 2015 in the French Hospital Database on HIV. The Andersen and Gill model was used to calculate the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs), focusing on heavy alcohol use and neutrophil function-altering comorbidities. Results. Of 25 795 participants, 1414 developed 1883 severe bacterial infections. Between 2006 and 2009 and 2013 and 2015, the incidence fell from 13.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.3-14.1) to 7.1 (95% CI, 6.3-7.8) per 1000 person-years. Heavy alcohol use was associated with an increased risk of severe bacterial infection (HR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.1-1.7 for 40-80 g/day and HR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2-2.1 for >80 g/day), as were diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage liver disease (HR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.0-1.4 when 1 comorbidity; HR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.6-3.4 when more than 1 comorbidity), and nonacquired immune deficiency syndrome-defining malignancy (HR = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.6-2.4). Conclusions. Heavy alcohol use was associated with an increased risk of severe bacterial infection, as were neutrophil function-altering comorbidities. Controlled-drinking approaches should be promoted and comorbidity management should be strengthened in PWH.";https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/222/5/765/5816760;10.4;9.2;9.0;00221899;;;;

There are two types of HIV, HIV-1, and HIV-2, which are geographically different in epidemiology and determinants. Objective: To determine the epidemiology and determinants of HIV-1 and HIV-1&2 in the three tertiary hospitals of Eastern Peninsular Malaysia. Method: A cross-sectional study of confirmed serologically HIV-1 and HIV-1&2 from January 2016 until December 2018. SPSS analysed all collected data, descriptive statistics for sociodemographic data and Pearson chi-square for the association between type of HIV with HCV, HBV, syphilis, and tuberculosis. In identifying the risk factorassociated with HIV-1&2, several variables were tested by the Multiple Logistic Regression Model. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Out of 519 serologically diagnosed HIV, 344 (66.28%) were HIV-1, and 175 (33.72%) were HIV-1&2. HIV positive were highly distributed in Malay male in both groups. Most HIV-1 patients were single, unemployed, and presented with tuberculosis. HIV-1&2 were single and employed, mostly asymptomatic at diagnosis. The commonest mode of transmission for HIV-1 was by sexual contact (31.87%), whereas IVDU (13.63%) in HIV-1&2. Co-infection with tuberculosis (P=0.005) and HCV (P<0.001) were significantly higher in HIV-1 as compared to HIV-1&2. IVDU was a significant determinant to develop HIV-1&2 (Adjusted OR: 3.5, 95% CI=1.875-5.227, P<0.001). Conclusion: HIV-1&2 was high in this study. Patients with HIV-1&2 present in less severe symptoms compared to the patient with HIV-1. A further molecular diagnostic study should be tested to confirm the type of HIV.;None;0.3;0.2;0.1;16758544;;;;

Among the strong HLA binders (IC50  50), we uncovered 16 alleles (the top ones being A*02:02, B*15:03 and DRB1*01:02) binding more than 1% of peptides derived from all viruses, 9 (top ones including HLA-A*68:01, B*15:25, C*03:02 and DRB1*07:01) binding all viruses except HIV-1, and 15 (top ones A*02:01 and C*14:02) only binding coronaviruses. The frequencies of strongest and weakest HLA peptide binders differ significantly among populations from different geographic regions. In particular, Indigenous peoples of America show both higher frequencies of strongest and lower frequencies of weakest HLA binders. As many HLA proteins are found to be strong binders of peptides derived from distinct viral families, and are hence promiscuous (or generalist), we discuss this result in relation to possible signatures of natural selection on HLA promiscuous alleles due to past pathogenic infections. Our findings are highly relevant for both evolutionary genetics and the development of vaccine therapies. However they should not lead to forget that individual resistance and vulnerability to diseases go beyond the sole HLA allelic affinity and depend on multiple, complex and often unknown biological, environmental and other variables.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tan.13956;2.9;2.8;2.7;20592302;;;;

Predominated by HIV-1 clade C (HIV-1C), the epidemic in India represents the third largest population infected with HIV-1 globally. Glycoprotein 41 (gp41) is critical for viral replication and is a target for the design of therapeutic strategies. However, documentation of viral diversity of gp41 gene in infected individuals from India remains limited. Present study employed high throughput sequencing to examine variation in gp41 amplicons generated from blood derived viruses in 24 HIV-1C infected individuals from Mumbai, India. Sequence diversity profiles were documented in different functional domains of gp41. Furthermore, through a meta-analysis approach, all reported gp41 sequences from India (N = 70) were compared with those from South Africa (N = 126), country with the largest HIV epidemic globally, also predominated by HIV-1C. A total of 44 positions displayed statistically significant differential (p < 0.05) Shannon entropy in the two regions. This comparison also identified 11 codon sites undergoing distinct selection, 8 of which remained differentially selected in an extended comparison of data from Asia (N = 137) and Africa(N = 383). Assessment of correlated mutation networks associated with differentially selected residues revealed common as well as distinct interaction networks. Furthermore, codon usage analysis revealed 17 differentially selected codons (Mann–Whitney test, p < 0.001) in Asia and Africa. Dissimilar trends in GC content across codon positions were also observed. In depth understanding of these divergent evolutionary signatures through extended analysis with larger data-sets would assist development of effective interventions being considered for HIV-1C.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13337-020-00595-x;1.8;1.3;1.5;23473584;;;;

The viral integrase (IN) enzyme catalyzes integration. IN is an ideal therapeutic enzyme targeted by several drugs; raltegravir (RAL), elvitegravir (EVG), dolutegravir (DTG), and bictegravir (BIC) having been approved by the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Due to high HIV-1 diversity, it is not well understood how specific naturally occurring polymorphisms (NOPs) in IN may affect the structure/function and binding affinity of integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). We applied computational methods of molecular modelling and docking to analyze the effect of NOPs on the full-length IN structure and INSTI binding. We identified 13 NOPs within the Cameroonian-derived CRF02_AG IN sequences and further identified 17 NOPs within HIV-1C South African sequences. The NOPs in the IN structures did not show any differences in INSTI binding affinity. However, linear regression analysis revealed a positive correlation between the Ki and EC50 values for DTG and BIC as strong inhibitors of HIV-1 IN subtypes. All INSTIs are clinically effective against diverse HIV-1 strains from INSTI treatment-naïve populations. This study supports the use of second-generation INSTIs such as DTG and BIC as part of first-line combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimens, due to a stronger genetic barrier to the emergence of drug resistance.";https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/9/936;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

We aimed to predict the potential effects of such disruptions on HIV-related deaths and new infections in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: In this modelling study, we used five well described models of HIV epidemics (Goals, Optima HIV, HIV Synthesis, an Imperial College London model, and Epidemiological MODeling software [EMOD]) to estimate the effect of various potential disruptions to HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services on HIV-related deaths and new infections in sub-Saharan Africa lasting 6 months over 1 year from April 1, 2020. We considered scenarios in which disruptions affected 20%, 50%, and 100% of the population. Findings: A 6-month interruption of supply of antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs across 50% of the population of people living with HIV who are on treatment would be expected to lead to a 1·63 times (median across models; range 1·39–1·87) increase in HIV-related deaths over a 1-year period compared with no disruption. In sub-Saharan Africa, this increase amounts to a median excess of HIV deaths, across all model estimates, of 296 000 (range 229 023–420 000) if such a high level of disruption occurred. Interruption of ART would increase mother-to-child transmission of HIV by approximately 1·6 times. Although an interruption in the supply of ART drugs would have the largest impact of any potential disruptions, effects of poorer clinical care due to overstretched health facilities, interruptions of supply of other drugs such as co-trimoxazole, and suspension of HIV testing would all have a substantial effect on population-level mortality (up to a 1·06 times increase in HIV-related deaths over a 1-year period due to disruptions affecting 50% of the population compared with no disruption). Interruption to condom supplies and peer education would make populations more susceptible to increases in HIV incidence, although physical distancing measures could lead to reductions in risky sexual behaviour (up to 1·19 times increase in new HIV infections over a 1-year period if 50% of people are affected). Interpretation: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the primary priority for governments, donors, suppliers, and communities should focus on maintaining uninterrupted supply of ART drugs for people with HIV to avoid additional HIV-related deaths. The provision of other HIV prevention measures is also important to prevent any increase in HIV incidence.

Such transmission heterogeneity can impact how fast and how much an epidemic spreads. Further, more efficient interventions may be achieved by taking such transmission heterogeneity into account. To address these issues, we developed two phylogenetic methods based on virus sequence data: 1) to generally detect if significant transmission heterogeneity is present, and 2) to pinpoint where in a phylogeny high-level spread is occurring. We derive inference procedures to estimate model parameters, including the amount of transmission heterogeneity, in a sampled epidemic. We show that it is possible to detect transmission heterogeneity under a wide range of simulated situations, including incomplete sampling, varying levels of heterogeneity, and including within-host genetic diversity. When evaluating real HIV-1 data from different epidemic scenarios, we found a lower level of transmission heterogeneity in slowly spreading situations and a higher level of heterogeneity in data that included a rapid outbreak, while R0 and Sackin's index (overall tree shape statistic) were similar in the two scenarios, suggesting that our new method is able to detect transmission heterogeneity in real data. We then show by simulations that targeted prevention, where we pinpoint high-level spread using a coalescence measurement, is efficient when sequence data are collected in an ongoing surveillance system. Such phylogeny-guided prevention is efficient under both single-step contact tracing as well as iterative contact tracing as compared to random intervention.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008122;7.8;7.2;7.3;1553734X;;;;

Numerical solutions using the 4th order Runge Kutta (RK4) method are obtained in order to understand the mechanism of the mathematical model.

We investigated the characteristics of phylogenetic clusters in notified cases of HIV among heterosexual migrants. Methods Partial HIV pol sequences obtained from routine clinical genotype tests were linked to Victorian HIV notifications with the following exposures listed on the notification form: heterosexual sexual contact, injecting drug use, bisexual sexual contact, male-to male sexual contact or heterosexual sexual contact in combination with injecting drug use, unknown exposure. Those with heterosexual sexual contact as the only exposure were the focus of this study, with the other exposures included to better understand transmission networks. Additional reference sequences were extracted from the Los Alamos database. Maximum likelihood methods were used to infer the phylogeny and the robustness of the resulting tree was assessed using bootstrap analysis. Phylogenetic clusters were defined on the basis of bootstrap and genetic distance. Results HIV pol sequences were available for 332 of 445 HIV notifications attributed to only heterosexual sexual contact in Victoria from 2005–2014. Forty-three phylogenetic clusters containing at least one heterosexual migrant were detected, 30 (70%) of which were pairs. The characteristics of these phylogenetic clusters varied considerably by cluster size. Pairs were more likely to be composed of people living with HIV from a single country of birth (p = 0.032). Larger clusters (n3) were more likely to contain people born in Australian/New Zealand (p = 0.002), migrants from more than one country of birth (p = 0.013) and viral subtype-B, the most common subtype in Australia (p = 0.006). Pairs were significantly more likely to contain females (p = 0.037) and less likely to include HIV diagnoses with male-to-male sexual contact reported as a possible exposure (p<0.001) compared to larger clusters (n3). Conclusion Migrants appear to be at elevated risk of HIV acquisition, in part due to intimate relationships between migrants from the same country of origin, and in part due to risks associated with the broader Australian HIV epidemic. However, there was no evidence of large transmission clusters driven by heterosexual transmission between migrants. A multipronged approach to prevention of HIV among migrants is warranted.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237469;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

A series of pregnenolone analogues, 3-((aryl)-1-(5-pregnen-3-ol-17-yl)prop-2-en-1-ones, were synthesized. Further, treatment of 3-((4-bromo-, 4-trifluoromethyl, or 4-methylphenyl)-1-(preg-5-en-3-ol-17-yl)prop-2-en-1-ones with thiosemicarbazide in ethanolic KOH or hydrazine hydrate in HOAc gave 5-(4-bromo-, 4-trifluoromethyl, or 4-methylphenyl)-3-(preg-5-en-3-ol-17-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazoline-1-carbothioamides and 1-O-acetyl-(5-(4-bromophenyl)-3-(preg-5-en-3-ol-17-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazoline, respectively. Analogously, treatment of 3-((4-bromophenyl)-1-(preg-5-en-3-ol-17-yl)prop-2-en-1-one with hydroxylamine afforded the Z/E isomers of 3-(4-bromophenyl)-1-(preg-5-en-3-ol-17-yl)prop-2-en-1-one oxime. The new compounds were assayed against HIV-1 and HIV-2 in MT-4 cells. Compounds 3-(thiophene-2-yl)-1-(preg-5-en-3-ol-17-yl)prop-2-en-1-one and 1-O-acetyl-(5-(4-bromophenyl)-3-(preg-5-en-3-ol-17-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazoline were the most active in inhibiting HIV-1 and HIV-2 with IC50 = 60.5 M (SI > 2, against HIV-2 and SI < I against HIV-1), and > 0.29 M (SI < I), respectively, suggesting to be new leads in the development of antiviral agents. QSAR of 3-((aryl)-1-(5-pregnen-3-ol-17-yl)prop-2-en-1-ones and 5-(substituted phenyl)-3-(5-preg-5-3-ol-17-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carbothioamides has been studied.

We evaluated the origin of HIV-1 variants carried by South American transgenders living in Milan by combining accurate phylogenetic methods and epidemiological data. Methods We collected 156 HIV-1 pol sequences obtained from transgender patients engaged in sex work (TSWs) followed between 1999 and 2015 at L. Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted by HIV-TRACE, MrBayes, MacClade and Beast programs. Reference sequences were retrieved from Los Alamos and local databases. Last negative testing or proxy data from clinical records of infected individuals were used to investigate the country of infection. Results Among South American TSWs, the most represented HIV-1 subtypes were B (70.5%), F1 (12.8%) and C (4.4%). Gene flow migrations of B subtype indicated significant fluxes from TSWs to Italians (21.3%) belonging to all risk groups (26.4% to heterosexuals (HEs), 18.9% to men who have sex with men (MSM), 15.1% to injecting drug users). The largest proportion of bidirectional fluxes were observed between Italians and TSWs (24.6%). For F1 subtype, bidirectional viral fluxes involved TSWs and Italians (7.1% and 14.3%), and a similar proportion of fluxes linked TSWs and Italian HEs or MSM (both 15.8%). Significant fluxes were detected from Italians to TSWs for subtype C involving both MSM (30%) and HEs (40%). Country of HIV-1 acquisition was identified for 72 subjects; overall, the largest proportion of patients with B subtype (73.5%) acquired HIV-1 infection in South America. Conclusions Our results indicated that South American transgenders largely contribute to the heterogeneity of HIV-1 variants in our country. The high number of clusters based on all subtypes indicated numerous transmission chains in which TSWs were constantly intermixed with HEs and MSM. Our results strongly advocate interventions to facilitate prevention, diagnosis and HIV-1 care continuum among transgender people.";https://sti.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/sextrans-2019-054103;6.0;5.5;6.1;13684973;;;;

Enthusiasm for the use of gene editing as an anti-HIV-1 therapeutic has been tempered by concerns about the specificity and efficacy of this approach. Guide RNAs (gRNAs) that target conserved sequences across a wide range of genetically diverse HIV-1 isolates will have greater clinical utility. However, on-target efficacy should be considered in the context of off-target cleavage events as these may comprise an essential safety parameter for CRISPR-based therapeutics. We analyzed a panel of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) gRNAs directed to the 5 and 3 long terminal repeat (LTR) regions of HIV-1. We used in vitro cleavage assays with genetically diverse HIV-1 LTR sequences to determine gRNA activity across HIV-1 clades. Lipid-based transfection of gRNA/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins was used to assess targeting of the integrated HIV-1 proviral sequence in cells (in vivo). For both the in vitro and in vivo experiments, we observed increased efficiency of sequence disruption through the simultaneous use of two distinct gRNAs. Next, CIRCLE-Seq was utilized to identify off-target cleavage events using genomic DNA from cells with integrated HIV-1 proviral DNA. We identified a gRNA targeting the U3 region of the LTR (termed SpCas9-127HBX2) with broad cleavage efficiency against sequences from genetically diverse HIV-1 strains. Based on these results, we propose a workflow for identification and development of anti-HIV CRISPR therapeutics.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2020.0055;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;;

We previously showed that the interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) capsid with cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 6 (CPSF6) localizes viral preintegration complexes (PICs) to nuclear speckles for integration into transcriptionally active speckle-associated domains (SPADs). In the absence of the capsid-CPSF6 interaction, PICs uncharacteristically accumulate at the nuclear periphery and target heterochromatic lamina-associated domains (LADs) for integration. The integrase-binding protein lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)/p75 in contrast to CPSF6 predominantly functions to direct HIV-1 integration to interior regions of transcription units. Though CPSF6 and LEDGF/p75 can reportedly interact with the capsid and integrase proteins of both primate and nonprimate lentiviruses, the extents to which these different viruses target SPADs versus LADs, as well as their dependencies on CPSF6 and LEDGF/p75 for integration targeting, are largely unknown. Here, we mapped 5,489,157 primate and nonprimate lentiviral integration sites in HEK293T and Jurkat T cells as well as derivative cells that were knocked out or knocked down for host factor expression. Despite marked preferences of all lentiviruses to target genes for integration, nonprimate lentiviruses only marginally favored SPADs, with corresponding upticks in LAD-proximal integration. While LEDGF/ p75 knockout disrupted the intragenic integration profiles of all lentiviruses similarly, CPSF6 depletion specifically counteracted SPAD integration targeting by primate lentiviruses. CPSF6 correspondingly failed to appreciably interact with nonprimate lentiviral capsids. We conclude that primate lentiviral capsid proteins evolved to interact with CPSF6 to optimize PIC localization for integration into transcriptionally active SPADs. IMPORTANCE Integration is the defining step of the retroviral life cycle and underlies the inability to cure HIV/AIDS through the use of intensified antiviral therapy. The reservoir of latent, replication-competent proviruses that forms early during HIV infection reseeds viremia when patients discontinue medication. HIV cure research is accordingly focused on the factors that guide provirus formation and associated chromatin environments that regulate transcriptional reactivation, and studies of orthologous infectious agents such as nonprimate lentiviruses can inform basic principles of HIV biology. HIV-1 utilizes the integrase-binding protein LEDGF/p75 and the capsid interactor CPSF6 to target speckle-associated domains (SPADs) for integration. However, the extent to which these two host proteins regulate integration of other lentiviruses is largely unknown. Here, we mapped millions of retroviral integration sites in cell lines that were depleted for LEDGF/p75 and/or CPSF6. Our results reveal that primate lentiviruses uniquely target SPADs for integration in a CPSF6-dependent manner.;https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/5/e02254-20;11.2;10.5;9.9;21612129;;;;

The Mozambique Ministry of Health, with support from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), added Bio-Rad Geenius™ HIV-1/2 Supplemental Assay to the IMASIDA HIV testing algorithm to confirm all specimens that were found to be reactive on one or both EIAs. In total 11690 specimens were collected to estimate the proportion of HIV positive samples. Results indicate that the proportion of HIV positive samples based on the concordant positive results of two EIA assays was 21.5% (2518/11690). The addition of the Geenius assay to the IMASIDA HIV testing algorithm demonstrated that 792 (31.5%) of 2518 specimens were false-positive and reduced the proportion of HIV positive samples to 14.7% (1722/11690), demonstrating the importance of including a highly specific HIV test to confirm HIV diagnosis. HIV surveys exclusively based on EIA testing algorithm may result in misleading high prevalence results. Our results demonstrate that more specific confirmatory testing should be added to the EIA-based algorithms to ensure accurate HIV diagnosis and correct HIV prevalence estimate in cross-sectional surveys.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239782;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

DESIGN: Nested case-control study. METHODS: Women participating in a prospective study of peripartum HIV acquisition in Kenya (the Mama Salama Study), were tested for HIV-1 at 1-3 month intervals during pregnancy and through 9 months postpartum. Cases positive for HIV-1 RNA during follow-up (N = 14), were matched 3 : 1 with HIV-negative controls (N = 42) based on age, marital status, partner HIV-1 status, transactional sex, and timing of cervical swab collection. Concentrations of five cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IFN, and TNF) and four chemokines (IL-8, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 , and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 ) were measured from cervical swabs collected at the visit prior to HIV-1 diagnosis (cases) or matched gestational/postpartum time (controls). Cytokine/chemokine concentrations were compared between cases and controls using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Principal component analysis was used to create a summary score for closely correlated cytokines/chemokines. Associations with HIV-1 acquisition were analyzed using conditional logistic regression. Path analysis was used to evaluate hypothesized relationships between CXCL10, vaginal washing, Nugent score, and HIV-1 acquisition. RESULTS: Conditional logistic regression analysis demonstrated an association between increased concentrations of CXCL10 and HIV-1 acquisition (odds ratio = 1.74, 95% confidence interval 1.04, 2.93; P = 0.034). Path analysis confirmed a positive independent association between higher concentrations of CXCL10 and HIV-1 acquisition (path coefficient = 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.15, 0.59; P < 0.001).

For effective antibody response, presence of functionally competent memory B cells (MEBs) is important; however, HIV-infection is known to alter the B-cell functionality. Very limited data are available on the HIV-specific memory B-cell population in HIV-infected Indian population. METHODS: In this study, the frequencies of HIV-gp140-specific MEBs were measured in individuals with nonprogressive [long-term-nonprogressors (LTNPs), N = 20] and progressive (N = 19) HIV infection using multicolor flow cytometry. The activation and functional status of these MEBs were assessed as frequencies and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the CD38 and CD40 expression, respectively. RESULTS: The percentages of gp140 + MEBs were higher in LTNPs than seen in progressors (P = 0.0475) and associated with higher CD4 cell count (P = 0.0312, r = 0.2833). As compared with the progressors, LTNPs also showed higher functional (CD40+) gp140 + MEBs both frequencies (P < 0.0001) and CD40 MFI (P = 0.0222), whereas the frequencies (<0.0001) and the MFI (P = 0.0047) of CD38 expression was significantly lower. Higher CD4 cell counts and lower plasma viral load values were associated with higher frequencies of CD40+ gp140 + MEBs (P < 0.0001, r = 0.4962) (P = 0.0036, r = -0.4202) and lower frequencies (P = 0.0008, r = -0.4231) and CD38 expression (MFI) (P = 0.004, r = -0.3719) (P = 0.0066, r = 0.4033). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that LTNPs have functional HIV-specific memory B-cell compartment with reduced activation that may lead to effective HIV-specific humoral immune responses contributing to their nondisease progression status. These findings would help in better understanding of the characteristics of the HIV-specific memory B-cell population in nonprogressive HIV infection.";https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAD.0000000000002620;8.8;7.1;7.5;;;;;

Methods: This was a retrospective, observational study including patients with AEHI (Fiebig stages I–V) diagnosed between January 2008 and December 2014 at 20 Italian centres. IVR was defined by: (1) viral blip (51–1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL after achievement of < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL); (2) virologic failure [> 1000 copies/mL after achievement of < 200 copies/mL, or  200 copies/mL after 24 weeks on an antiretroviral therapy (ART)]; (3) suboptimal viral response (> 50 copies/mL after 48 weeks on ART or two consecutive HIV-1 RNA levels with ascending trend during ART). Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for IVR. Results: In all, 263 patients were studied, 227 (86%) males, with a median [interquartile range (IQR)] age of 38 (30–46) years. During a median follow-up of 13.0 (5.7–31.1) months, 38 (14.4%) had IVR. The presence of central nervous system (CNS) symptoms was linked to a higher risk of IVR (HR = 4.70, 95% CI: 1.56–14.17), while a higher CD4/CD8 cell count ratio (HR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03–0.51 for each point increase) and first-line ART with three-drug regimens recommended by current guidelines (HR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.18–0.91 compared with other regimens including four or five drugs, older drugs or non-standard backbones) were protective against IVR. Conclusions: Patients with lower CD4/CD8 ratio and CNS symptoms could be at a higher risk of IVR after AEHI. The use of recommended ART may be relevant for improving short-term viral efficacy in this group of patients.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hiv.12885;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;;

The model is formulated using a system of delay differential- and integral equations. The model is applied to study the possibility of eradication of HIV infection during the primary acute phase of the disease. To this end a combination of analytical examination and computational treatment is used. The model belongs to the Wazewski differential equation systems with delay. The conditions of asymptotic stability of a trivial steady state solution are expressed in terms of the algebraic Sevastyanov–Kotelyanskii criterion. The results of the computational experiments with the model calibrated according to the available estimates of parameters suggest that a complete elimination of HIV-1 infection after acute phase of infection is feasible.;http://aimsciences.org//article/doi/10.3934/dcdss.2020141;1.9;1.7;1.7;15313492;;;;

However, little is known about the situation in Tianjin. Blood samples were collected from newly diagnosed, antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naive HIV/AIDS patients from January 2016 to November 2019. The target fragment in the pol gene was sequenced after RNA extraction and gene amplification. The HIV-1 genotype was identified by phylogenetic analysis. Drug resistance was carried out using the Stanford University HIVdb algorithm. A total of 305 pol sequences from 279 non-PDR individuals and 35 PDR individuals were successfully amplified. The most prevalent genotype was CRF01_AE (65.6%, 200/305), followed by CRF07_BC (22.0%, 67/305) and B (3.0%, 9/305). A variety of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms were found. The overall incidence of PDR was 11.5% (35/305), with 9.8% (30/305) to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NNRTIs). The most frequent mutation pattern against NNRTIs was V179D/E/T (6.9%, 21/305), with M184V (1.0%, 3/305) and K65R (1.0%, 3/305) against nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs). M64L (0.1%, 1/305) was the sole mutation found against protease inhibitors (PIs). Eight variants generated at least low-level resistance to NNRTIs (2.6%, 8/305), which was much higher than that to NRTIs (1.6%, 5/305) and PIs (0/305) (p < .05). Genotypic drug resistance testing before initiating ART in newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS patients may be necessary in Tianjin, China. The non-NNRTI-based regimen may be preferred as initial therapy in Tianjin.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2020.0056;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;;

However, the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved the life expectancy for patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are in almost all HAART and target reverse transcriptase (RT), an essential enzyme for the virus. Even though NRTIs are highly effective, they have limitations caused by RT resistance. The main mechanisms of RT resistance to NRTIs are discrimination and excision. Understanding the molecular mechanisms for discrimination and excision are essential to develop more potent and selective NRTIs. Using protein X-ray crystallography, we determined the first crystal structure of RT in its post-catalytic state in complex with emtricitabine, (-)FTC or stavudine (d4T). Our structural studies provide the framework for understanding how RT discriminates between NRTIs and natural nucleotides, and for understanding the requirement of (-)FTC to undergo a conformation change for successful incorporation by RT. The crystal structure of RT in post-catalytic complex with d4T provides a “snapshot” for considering the possible mechanism of how RT develops resistance for d4T via excision. The findings reported herein will contribute to the development of next generation NRTIs.;https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/25/20/4868;4.5;4.1;4.1;;;;;

It affects millions of people worldwide and the pandemic persists despite the implementation of highly active antiretroviral therapy. A wide spectrum of techniques has been implemented in order to diagnose and monitor AIDS progression over the years. Besides the conventional approaches, microfluidics has provided useful methods for monitoring HIV-1 infection. In this review, we introduce continuous microfluidics as well as the fabrication and handling of microfluidic chips.

Oral Diseases published by John Wiley & Sons LtdA crucial aspect of mucosal HIV transmission is the interaction between HIV, the local environmental milieu and immune cells. The oral mucosa comprises many host cell types including epithelial cells, CD4 + T cells, dendritic cells and monocytes/macrophages, as well as a diverse microbiome predominantly comprising bacterial species. While the oral epithelium is one of the first sites exposed to HIV through oral-genital contact and nursing infants, it is largely thought to be resistant to HIV transmission via mechanisms that are still unclear. HIV-1 infection is also associated with predisposition to secondary infections, such as tuberculosis, and other diseases including cancer. This review addresses the following questions that were discussed at the 8th World Workshop on Oral Health and Disease in AIDS held in Bali, Indonesia, 13 September —15 September 2019: (a) How does HIV infection affect epithelial cell signalling? (b) How does HIV infection affect the production of cytokines and other innate antimicrobial factors, (c) How is the mucosal distribution and function of immune cells altered in HIV infection? (d) How do T cells affect HIV (oral) pathogenesis and cancer? (e) How does HIV infection lead to susceptibility to TB infections?.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/odi.13470;4.2;4.0;3.9;1354523X;;;;

While reversing this quiescence is an effective approach to reactivate latent HIV from T cells in culture, it can cause deleterious cytokine dysregulation in patients. As a key regulator of T-cell quiescence, FOXO1 promotes latency and suppresses productive HIV infection. We report that, in resting T cells, FOXO1 inhibition impaired autophagy and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, thereby activating two associated transcription factors: activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Both factors associate with HIV chromatin and are necessary for HIV reactivation. Indeed, inhibition of protein kinase R-like ER kinase, an ER stress sensor that can mediate the induction of ATF4, and calcineurin, a calcium-dependent regulator of NFAT, synergistically suppressed HIV reactivation induced by FOXO1 inhibition. Thus, our studies uncover a link of FOXO1, ER stress and HIV infection that could be therapeutically exploited to selectively reverse T-cell quiescence and reduce the size of the latent viral reservoir.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0742-9;9.3;16.5;23.2;;;;;

Although crucial advances in combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) over the last two decades have transformed an HIV-1 diagnosis into a tolerable and controlled condition, enabling over 20 million people living with HIV-1 to enjoy healthy and productive lives, no cure or vaccine yet exists. Developing a successful cure strategy will require a firm understanding of how viral latency is established and how a persistent and long-lived latent is generated. The latent reservoir remains the primary obstacle for cure development and most putative cure strategies proposed fundamentally address its eradication or permanent suppression.;None;3.2;5.0;5.8;00440086;;;;

All rights reserved.Background: The US National HIV/AIDS Strategy 2020 calls for increasing access to care, improving outcomes of people living with HIV, and targeting biomedical prevention efforts, including access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in communities where HIV is most heavily concentrated. The cities of Baltimore, Maryland (MD); Washington, DC; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (PA) are disproportionately burdened by high rates of new cases of HIV infection, with high prevalence among young Black and Latinx men who have sex with men (YBLMSM) and young Black and Latinx transgender women (YBLTW) aged 15-24 years. Objective: This study aims (1) to identify and recruit YBLMSM and YBLTW who are at risk or living with HIV in Baltimore, MD; Philadelphia, PA; and Washington, DC, using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) with targeted seed selection, and (2) to assess the efficacy of a coach-based mobile-enhanced intervention (MEI) compared with standard of care (SOC) to increase successful engagement and retention into HIV, PrEP, and substance use treatment care across the HIV care and prevention continua in 3 Mid-Atlantic cities. This paper describes the protocol and progress as of October 20, 2019. Methods: This study uses a multiphase mixed methods design. The first phase is a formative, qualitative research with focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The second phase consists of evaluating the ability of RDS with targeted seed selection. The third phase includes 2 embedded randomized controlled trials (RCTs), where participants complete a baseline sociobehavioral survey, rapid HIV testing, and eligible youth enroll in parallel status-dependent RCTs that randomize the participant to 1 of 2 study arms: MEI with coach or SOC. Participants are asked to complete a web-based survey and provide biologic specimens-HIV-1 RNA (viral load) or HIV-1 antibody test and urine drug screen-at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months, and an exit interview at 18 months. Results: A formative qualitative research was conducted in February 2017 and May 2018, and this led to further refinement of recruitment and study methods. Aim 1 recruitment began in September 2017 with subsequent enrollment into the RCTs. Recruitment is ongoing with 520 participants screened and 402 (77.3%) enrolled in aim 1 by October 2020. Of these, 159 are enrolled in the 2 randomized trials: 36 (22.6%) HIV-positive not virally suppressed (aim 2) and 123 (77.4%) high-risk HIV-negative (aim 3). Conclusions: This study has the potential to significantly impact the medical and substance use services provided to YBLMSM and YBLTW in the United States by providing rigorous scientific evidence outlining approaches and strategies that improve the uptake and engagement of YBLMSM and YBLTW in the HIV treatment and prevention continuum.";https://www.researchprotocols.org/2020/9/e17269;0;0;0;;;;;

Inducing such an ability to spontaneously maintain undetectable plasma viraemia is a major objective of HIV-1 cure research, but the characteristics of proviral reservoirs in elite controllers remain to be determined. Here, using next-generation sequencing of near-full-length single HIV-1 genomes and corresponding chromosomal integration sites, we show that the proviral reservoirs of elite controllers frequently consist of oligoclonal to near-monoclonal clusters of intact proviral sequences. In contrast to individuals treated with long-term antiretroviral therapy, intact proviral sequences from elite controllers were integrated at highly distinct sites in the human genome and were preferentially located in centromeric satellite DNA or in Krüppel-associated box domain-containing zinc finger genes on chromosome 19, both of which are associated with heterochromatin features. Moreover, the integration sites of intact proviral sequences from elite controllers showed an increased distance to transcriptional start sites and accessible chromatin of the host genome and were enriched in repressive chromatin marks. These data suggest that a distinct configuration of the proviral reservoir represents a structural correlate of natural viral control, and that the quality, rather than the quantity, of viral reservoirs can be an important distinguishing feature for a functional cure of HIV-1 infection. Moreover, in one elite controller, we were unable to detect intact proviral sequences despite analysing more than 1.5 billion peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which raises the possibility that a sterilizing cure of HIV-1 infection, which has previously been observed only following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation2,3, may be feasible in rare instances.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2651-8;53.7;55.7;51.0;00280836;;;;

However, they also impact the immune system, and it depends on the given context whether this is beneficial or not. The attenuated vaccinia virus strain modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) has been used as a viral vector in clinical studies intended to treat and prevent cancer and infectious diseases. The adjuvant property of MVA is thought to be due to its capability to stimulate innate immunity. Here, we confirmed that MVA induces interleukin-8 (IL-8), and this chemokine was upregulated significantly more in monocytes and HLA-DRbright dendritic cells (DCs) of HIV-infected patients on combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) than in cells of healthy persons. The effect of MVA on cell surface receptors is mostly unknown. Using mass cytometry profiling, we investigated the expression of 17 cell surface receptors in leukocytes after ex vivo infection of human whole-blood samples with MVA. We found that MVA downregulates most of the characteristic cell surface markers in particular types of leukocytes. In contrast, C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) was significantly upregulated in each leukocyte type of healthy persons. Additionally, we detected a relative higher cell surface expression of the HIV-1 co-receptors C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CXCR4 in leukocytes of HIV-ART patients than in healthy persons. Importantly, we showed that MVA infection significantly downregulated CCR5 in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and three different DC populations. CD86, a costimulatory molecule for T cells, was significantly upregulated in HLA-DRbright DCs after MVA infection of whole blood from HIV-ART patients. However, MVA was unable to downregulate cell surface expression of CD11b and CD32 in monocytes and neutrophils of HIV-ART patients to the same extent as in monocytes and neutrophils of healthy persons. In summary, MVA modulates the expression of many different kinds of cell surface receptors in leukocytes, which can vary in cells originating from persons previously infected with other pathogens.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2020.02096/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;;;;

Immigration waves from countries in Africa and in East Europe may have changed the local landscape of women diagnosed with HIV-1. Here, we aimed to assess viral and demographic characteristics of HIV-1-positive women identified in Israel between 2010 and 2018. Methods: All > 16 year-old, HIV-1-infected women, diagnosed in Israel in 2010-2018, (n = 763) registered in the National HIV reference laboratory were included in this cross-sectional study. Demographic and clinical characteristics were extracted from the database. Viral subtypes and transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) were determined in 337 (44.2%) randomly selected samples collected from treatment-naive women. Results: Median age at diagnosis was 38 years. Most (73.3%) women were immigrants from the former Soviet Union (FSU) (41.2%, 314) or sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (32.2%, 246) and carried subtype A (79.7%) or C (90.3%), respectively. Only 11.4% (87) were Israeli-born women. Over the years, the prevalence of women from SSA decreased while that of women from FSU increased significantly (p < 0.001). The median CD4+ cell count was 263 cells/mm3, and higher (391 cells/mm3) in Israeli-born women. TDRM were identified in 10.4% of the tested samples; 1.8, 3 and 7.1% had protease inhibitors (PI), nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) TDRM, respectively. The prevalence of women with NNRTI TDRM significantly increased from 4.9% in 2010-2012 to 13.3% in 2016-2018. Israeli-born women had the highest prevalence (16.3%) of NNRTI TDRM (p = 0.014). NRTI A62 (5.6%), NNRTI E138 and K103 (5.6 and 4.2%, respectively) were the most prominent mutated sites. Conclusions: Most HIV-1-positive women diagnosed in Israel in 2010-2018 were immigrants, with the relative ratio of FSU immigrants increasing in recent years. The high proportion of women diagnosed with resistance mutations, particularly, the yearly increase in the frequency of NNRTI mutations, support the national policy of resistance testing at baseline.";https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05389-6;4.5;4.3;4.1;;;;;

CCL3L1 exhibits variation in the gene copy number (CN) and could influence HIV susceptibility through gene dosage effect. The study aims to determine the distribution of CCL3L1 CN among HIV subjects of Malay, Chinese, and Indian ethnics in Malaysia and to evaluate the impact of CCL3L1 CN on susceptibility to HIV. This study involved 182 HIV patients who attended outpatient clinics of three hospitals in Malaysia and 150 non-HIV (control) subjects. Typing of CCL3L1 CN was conducted via multiplex paralogue ratio tests (PRTs), followed by validation of the CCL3L1 CN by microsatellite analyses. Both Malay and Indian HIV subjects had the CN mode of two, while the CN mode for the Chinese was four. The CCL3L1 gene CN was found to be strongly associated with ethnicity (p < 0.001) with the diverse distribution of CCL3L1 CN between the Malay (range = 0–6), Chinese (range = 0–9), and Indian (range = 1–4) ethnic groups. CCL3L1 CN higher than and equal to the average was associated with reduced HIV susceptibility among the Malays (p < 0.05). However, the negative results found for the Indian and Chinese need to be further analysed in a larger sample size.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S037811192030490X;5.0;4.4;4.8;03781119;S037811192030490X;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S037811192030490X;;

For simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) to transmit to a new primate host, as happened multiple times to seed the ongoing HIV-1 epidemic, the viral infectivity factor (Vif) must be capable of neutralizing the APOBEC3 enzymes of the new host. Although much is known about current interactions of HIV-1 Vif and human APOBEC3s, the evolutionary changes in SIV Vif required for transmission from chimpanzees to gorillas and ultimately to humans are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that gorilla APOBEC3G is a factor with the potential to hamper SIV transmission from chimpanzees to gorillas. Gain-of-function experiments using SIVcpzPtt Vif revealed that this barrier could be overcome by a single Vif acidic amino acid substitution (M16E). Moreover, degradation of gorilla APOBEC3F is induced by Vif through a mechanism that is distinct from that of human APOBEC3F. Thus, our findings identify virus adaptations in gorillas that preceded and may have facilitated transmission to humans.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008812;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

Less is known about changes in markers of immune activation in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in whom a sustained virologic response (SVR) is achieved. METHODS: We conducted a nonrandomized clinical trial of 12 or 24 weeks of paritaprevir-ritonavir-ombitasvir plus dasabuvir (PrOD) with or without ribavirin in persons with HCV-1/HIV coinfection suppressed with antiretroviral therapy. Plasma HCV, soluble CD14 (sCD14), interferon-inducible protein 10, soluble CD163 (sCD163), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 18, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), autotaxin (ATX), and Mac2-binding protein (Mac2BP) were measured over 48 weeks. RESULTS: Participants were treated with PrOD for 12 (n = 9) or 24 (n = 36) weeks; the SVR rate at 12 weeks was 93%. At baseline, cirrhosis was associated with higher ATX and MCP-1, female sex with higher ATX and IL-6, older age with higher Mac2BP, higher body mass index with higher ATX, and HIV-1 protease inhibitor use with higher sCD14 levels. In those with SVR, interferon-inducible protein 10, ATX, and Mac2BP levels declined by week 2, interleukin 18 levels declined by the end of treatment, sCD14 levels did not change, and sCD163, MCP-1, and IL-6 levels changed at a single time point. CONCLUSIONS: During HIV/HCV coinfection, plasma immune activation marker heterogeneity is in part attributable to age, sex, cirrhosis, body mass index, and/or type of antiretroviral therapy. HCV treatment with paritaprevir-ritonavir-ombitasvir plus dasabuvir is highly effective and is associated with variable rate and magnitude of decline in markers of immune activation.

The present study aims to systematically compare some of the most commonly used DSP strategies for capture and purification of enveloped viruses and virus-like particles (eVLPs) by using the same staring material and analytical tools. As a model, Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) gag VLPs produced in CHO cells were used. Four different DSP strategies were tested. An anion-exchange monolith and a membrane adsorber, for direct capture and purification of eVLPs, and a polymer-grafted anion-exchange resin and a heparin-affinity resin for eVLP purification after a first flow-through step to remove small impurities. All tested strategies were suitable for capture and purification of eVLPs. The performance of the different strategies was evaluated regarding its binding capacity, ability to separate different particle populations and product purity. The highest binding capacity regarding total particles was obtained using the anion exchange membrane adsorber (5.3 × 1012 part/mL membrane), however this method did not allow the separation of different particle populations. Despite having a lower binding capacity (1.5 × 1011 part/mL column) and requiring a pre-processing step with flow-through chromatography, Heparin-affinity chromatography showed the best performance regarding separation of different particle populations, allowing not only the separation of HIV-1 gag VLPs from host cell derived bionanoparticles but also from chromatin. This work additionally shows the importance of thorough sample characterization combining several biochemical and biophysical methods in eVLP DSP.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021967320306555;7.0;6.8;7.5;00219673;S0021967320306555;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0021967320306555;;

CD160+ CD8+ T cells derived from HIV+ patients correlated with slow progressions both in a cross-sectional study and in a 60-month longitudinal cohort, displaying enhanced cytotoxicity and proliferative capacity in response to HIV Gag stimulation; triggering CD160 promoted their functionalities through MEK–ERK and PI3K–AKT pathways. These observations were corroborated by studying chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice. The genetic ablation of CD160 severely impaired LCMV-specific CD8+ T cell functionalities and thereby resulted in loss of virus control.

One of the main cohorts within this group is men who have sex with men (MSM). Studies of this cohort have revealed different immunological and genetic mechanisms that can explain the phenomenon of natural HIV resistance. NK cells’ higher effector capacity is related to natural resistance to HIV. Besides, a new population of NK cells with adaptive features was described recently. These cells are increased in some HESN cohorts and appear to be involved in better control of viral replication in primarily HIV-infected subjects. The present study evaluated the role of NK cells in the natural resistance to HIV-1 infection in MSM. Methodology: Phenotypic and functional features were evaluated in NK cells from two groups of MSM, at different risks of HIV infection, according to the number of sexual partners. The production of IFN- and -chemokines was included in the analysis, as well as the cytotoxic capacity and adaptive NK cell frequency. Genetic features, such as HLA and KIR allele frequencies, were also explored. Results: High-risk MSM exhibit an increased frequency of fully mature and CD57+/NKG2Chigh NK cells. These individuals also show higher cytotoxic capacity and IFN- production in response to K562 stimuli. NK cells with a CD107a+/IFN-+ functional profile were found more frequently and displayed higher IFN- production capacity among high-risk MSM than among low-risk MSM. The protective allele HLA-B18 was only present in the high-risk MSM group as well as HLA-B 39. The protective phenotype KIR3DL1/S1-HLA-BBw4, in a homozygous state, was particularly abundant in the high-risk population. Notably, some of these functional features were related to higher frequencies of mature and CD57+/NKG2Chigh NK cells, which, in turn, were associated with a higher number of sexual partners. Conclusion: The changes observed in the NK cell compartment can be driven by the magnitude of sexual exposure and immunological challenges of high-risk individuals, which could influence their resistance/susceptibility to HIV infection.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2020.537044/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;;;;

The efficiency of a virus to establish its infection in host cells varies broadly among viruses. It remains unclear if there is a key step in this process that controls viral infectivity. To address this question, we use single-particle tracking and Brownian dynamics simulation to examine human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in cell culture. We find that the frequency of viral-cell encounters is consistent with diffusion-limited interactions. However, even under the most favorable conditions, only 1% of the viruses can become immobilized on cell surface and subsequently enter the cell. This is a result of weak interaction between viral surface gp120 and CD4 receptor, which is insufficient to form a stable complex the majority of the time. We provide the first direct quantitation for efficiencies of these events relevant to measured HIV-1 infectivity and demonstrate that immobilization on host cell surface post-virion-diffusion is the key step in viral infection. Variation of its probability controls the efficiency of a virus to infect its host cells. These results explain the low infectivity of cell-free HIV-1 in vitro and offer a potential rationale for the pervasive high efficiency of cell-to-cell transmission of animal viruses.;https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.128101;15.7;15.4;15.6;00319007;;;;

Glycolytic enzymes are typical moonlighting proteins, and these enzymes control the infection of various viruses. Previously, we reported that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and alpha-enolase (ENO1) are incorporated into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles from viral producer cells and suppress viral reverse transcription independently each other. However, it remains unclear whether these proteins expressed in viral target cells affect the early phase of HIV-1 replication. Results: Here we show that the GAPDH expression level in viral target cells does not affect the early phase of HIV-1 replication, but ENO1 has a capacity to suppress viral integration in viral target cells. In contrast to GAPDH, suppression of ENO1 expression by RNA interference in the target cells increased viral infectivity, but had no effect on the expression levels of the HIV-1 receptors CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 and on the level of HIV-1 entry. Quantitative analysis of HIV-1 reverse transcription products showed that the number of copies of the late products (R/gag) and two-long-terminal-repeat circular forms of viral cDNAs did not change but that of the integrated (Alu-gag) form increased. In contrast, overexpression of ENO1 in viral target cells decreased viral infectivity owing to the low viral integration efficiency. Results of subcellular fractionation experiments suggest that the HIV integration at the nucleus was negatively regulated by ENO1 localized in the nucleus. In addition, the overexpression of ENO1 in both viral producer cells and target cells most markedly suppressed the viral replication. Conclusions: These results indicate that ENO1 in the viral target cells prevents HIV-1 integration. Importantly, ENO1, but not GAPDH, has the bifunctional inhibitory activity against HIV-1 replication. The results provide and new insights into the function of ENO1 as a moonlighting protein in HIV-1 infection.;https://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12977-020-00539-9;7.3;6.7;6.7;;;;;

However, these assays are costly and time-consuming for routine handling of a large number of HIV-1 samples. For example, sample dilution is always required in the ELISA procedure to determine p24 protein levels because of the very narrow range of detectable concentrations in this assay. Here, we establish a novel HIV-1 production assay system to solve the aforementioned problems by using a recently developed small peptide tag called HiBiT. This peptide is a fragment of NanoLuc luciferase and generates a strong luminescent signal when complemented with the remaining subunit. To employ this technology, we constructed a novel full-length proviral HIV-1 DNA clone and a lentiviral packaging vector in which the HiBiT tag was added to the C terminus of the integrase. Tagging the integrase with the HiBiT sequence did not impede the resultant virus production, infectivity, or susceptibility to an integrase inhibitor. EM revealed normal morphology of the virus particles. Most importantly, by comparing between ELISA and the HiBiT luciferase assay, we successfully obtained an excellent linear correlation between p24 concentrations and HiBiT-based luciferase activity. Overall, we conclude that HiBiT-tagged viruses can replace the parental HIV-1 and lentiviral vectors, which enables us to perform a super-rapid, inexpensive, convenient, simple, and highly accurate quantitative assay for HIV-1/lentivirus production. This system can be widely applied to a variety of virological studies, along with screening for candidates of future antiviral drugs.;http://www.jbc.org/lookup/doi/10.1074/jbc.RA120.013887;8.2;7.7;7.4;;;;;

Whereas antiretroviral drugs target an actively replicating virus, latent, nonreplicative forms persist during treatment. Pharmacological strategies that reactivate latent HIV-1 and expose cellular reservoirs to antiretroviral therapy and the host immune system have, so far, been unsuccessful, often triggering severe side effects, mainly due to systemic immune activation. Here, we present an alternative approach for stimulating latent HIV-1 expression via direct protein delivery of cell-penetrating zinc-finger activators (ZFAs). Cys2-His2 zinc-fingers, fused to a transcription activation domain, were engineered to recognize the HIV-1 promoter and induce targeted viral transcription. Following conjugation with multiple positively charged nuclear localization signal (NLS) repeats, protein delivery of a single ZFA (3NLS-PBS1-VP64) efficiently internalized HIV-1 latently infected T-lymphocytes and specifically stimulated viral expression. We show that short-term treatment with this ZFA protein induces higher levels of viral reactivation in cell line models of HIV-1 latency than those observed with gene delivery. Our work establishes protein delivery of ZFA as a novel and safe approach toward eradication of HIV-1 reservoirs. Eradication of HIV-1 infection is impeded by the persistence of cellular reservoirs harboring latent provirus. Stimulation of latent viral expression is considered critical to target HIV reservoirs for elimination. Perdigão et al. established a “gene-free” approach to specifically activate latent HIV expression through protein delivery of cell-penetrating zinc-finger activators. Engineered zinc-finger activators can translocate across the cell membrane and target the HIV promoter to induce viral expression from latently infected cells, providing a novel and safe route for the elimination of HIV-1 reservoirs.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2329050120301030;4.5;5.0;6.2;;S2329050120301030;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2329050120301030;;

We aim to test whether BCG vaccination may reduce susceptibility to and/or the severity of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in health care workers (HCW) and thus prevent work absenteeism. The primary objective is to reduce absenteeism due to illness among HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary objectives are to reduce the number of HCW that are infected with SARS-CoV-2, and to reduce the number of hospital admissions among HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hypothesis: BCG vaccination of HCW will reduce absenteeism by 20% over a period of 6 months. Trial design: Placebo-controlled, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial, recruiting study participants at several geographic locations. The BCG vaccine is used in this study on a different indication than the one it has been approved for by the Danish Medicines Agency, therefore this is classified as a phase III study. Participants: The trial will recruit 1,500 HCW at Danish hospitals. To be eligible for participation, a subject must meet the following criteria: Adult (18 years); Hospital personnel working at a participating hospital for more than 22 hours per week. A potential subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study: Known allergy to components of the BCG vaccine or serious adverse events to prior BCG administration Known prior active or latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) or other mycobacterial species Previous confirmed COVID-19 Fever (>38 C) within the past 24 hours Suspicion of active viral or bacterial infection Pregnancy Breastfeeding Vaccination with other live attenuated vaccine within the last 4 weeks Severely immunocompromised subjects. This exclusion category comprises: a) subjects with known infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) b) subjects with solid organ transplantation c) subjects with bone marrow transplantation d) subjects under chemotherapy e) subjects with primary immunodeficiency f) subjects under treatment with any anti-cytokine therapy within the last year g) subjects under treatment with oral or intravenous steroids defined as daily doses of 10 mg prednisone or equivalent for longer than 3 months h) Active solid or non-solid malignancy or lymphoma within the prior two years Direct involvement in the design or the execution of the BCG-DENMARK-COVID trial Intervention and comparator: Participants will be randomised to BCG vaccine (BCG-Denmark, AJ Vaccines, Copenhagen, Denmark) or placebo (saline). An adult dose of 0.1 ml of resuspended BCG vaccine (intervention) or 0.1 ml of sterile 0.9% NaCl solution (control) is administered intradermally in the upper deltoid area of the right arm. All participants will receive one injection at inclusion, and no further treatment of study participants will take place. Main outcomes: Main study endpoint: Days of unplanned absenteeism due to illness within 180 days of randomisation. Secondary study endpoints: The cumulative incidence of documented COVID-19 and the cumulative incidence of hospital admission for any reason within 180 days of randomisation. Randomisation: Randomisation will be done centrally using the REDCap tool with stratification by hospital, sex and age groups (+/- 45 years of age) in random blocks of 4 and 6. The allocation ratio is 1:1. Blinding (masking): Participants will be blinded to treatment. The participant will be asked to leave the room while the allocated treatment is prepared. Once ready for injection, vaccine and placebo will look similar, and the participant will not be able to tell the difference. The physicians administering the treatment are not blinded. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): Sample size: N=1,500. The 1,500 participants will be randomised 1:1 to BCG or placebo with 750 participants in each group. Trial Status: Current protocol version 5.1, from July 6, 2020. Recruitment of study participants started on May 18, 2020 and we anticipate having finished recruiting by the end of December 2020.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The HIV-1 Gag protein playing a key role in HIV-1 viral assembly has recently been shown to interact through its nucleocapsid domain with the ribosomal protein L7 (RPL7) that acts as a cellular co-factor promoting Gag's nucleic acid (NA) chaperone activity. To further understand how the two proteins act together, we examined their mechanism individually and in concert to promote the annealing between dTAR, the DNA version of the viral transactivation element and its complementary cTAR sequence, taken as model HIV-1 sequences. Gag alone or complexed with RPL7 was found to act as a NA chaperone that destabilizes cTAR stem-loop and promotes its annealing with dTAR through the stem ends via a two-step pathway. In contrast, RPL7 alone acts as a NA annealer that through its NA aggregating properties promotes cTAR/dTAR annealing via two parallel pathways.

This enzyme is an aspartyl protease that is functionally active in its dimeric form. Nuclear magnetic resonance reports have convincingly shown that a pseudosymmetry exists at the HIVPR active site, where only one of the two aspartates remains protonated over the pH range of 2.5-7.0. To date, all HIVPR-targeted drug design strategies focused on maximizing the size-shape complementarity and van der Waals interactions of the small molecule drugs with the deprotonated, symmetric active site envelope of crystallized HIVPR. However, these strategies were ineffective with the emergence of drug resistant protease variants, primarily due to the steric clashes at the active site. In this study, we traced a specificity in the substrate binding motif that emerges primarily from the asymmetrical electrostatic potential present in the protease active site due to the uneven protonation. Our detailed results from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations show that while such a specific mode of substrate binding involves significant electrostatic interactions, none of the existing drugs or inhibitors could utilize this electrostatic hot spot. As the electrostatic is long-range interaction, it can provide sufficient binding strength without the necessity of increasing the bulkiness of the inhibitors. We propose that introducing the electrostatic component along with optimal fitting at the binding pocket could pave the way for promising designs that might be more effective against both wild type and HIVPR resistant variants.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.biochem.0c00341;5.4;5.2;5.3;00062960;;;;

We previously showed that HIV-1 latent cells have altered TMM and are susceptible to ligands that target G-quadruplexes (G4) at telomeres. Susceptibility of latent cells to telomere targeting could potentially be used to support approaches to eradicate HIV reservoirs. However, G4 ligands also target G-quadruplexes in promoters blocking gene transcription. Since HIV promoter sequence can form G-quadruplexes, we investigated whether G4 ligands interfere with HIV-1 promoter activity and virus reactivation from latency, and whether telomere targeting could be combined with latency reversing agents (LRAs) to promote elimination of HIV reservoirs. Our results indicate that Sp1 binding region in HIV-1 promoter can adopt G4 structures in duplex DNA, and that in vitro binding of Sp1 to G-quadruplex is blocked by G4 ligand, suggesting that agents targeting telomeres interfere with virus reactivation. However, our studies show that G4 agents do not affect HIV-1 promoter activity in cell culture, and do not interfere with latency reversal. Importantly, primary memory CD4 + T cells infected with latent HIV-1 are more susceptible to combined treatment with LRAs and G4 ligands, indicating that drugs targeting TMM may enhance killing of HIV reservoirs. Using a cell-based DNA repair assay, we also found that HIV-1 infected cells have reduced efficiency of DNA mismatch repair (MMR), and base excision repair (BER), suggesting that altered TMM in latently infected cells could be associated with accumulation of DNA damage at telomeres and changes in telomeric caps.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15384101.2020.1796268;6.3;5.7;5.1;15384101;;;;

Allosteric HIV-1 integrase inhibitors promote aberrant IN multimerization by bridging IN-IN intermolecular interactions. However, the thermodynamic driving forces and kinetics of the multimerization remain largely unknown. Here, we explore the early steps in the IN multimerization by using umbrella sampling and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. In direct simulations, the two initially separated dimers spontaneously associate to form near-native complexes that resemble the crystal structure of the aberrant tetramer. Most strikingly, the effective interaction of the protein-protein association is very short-ranged: the two dimers associate rapidly within tens of nanoseconds when their binding surfaces are separated by d  4.3 Å (less than two water diameters). Beyond this distance, the oligomerization kinetics appears to be diffusion controlled with a much longer association time. The free-energy profile also captured the crucial role of allosteric IN inhibitors in promoting multimerization and explained why several C-terminal domain mutations are remarkably resistant to the drug-induced multimerization. The results also show that at small separation, the protein-protein binding process contains two consecutive phases with distinct thermodynamic signatures. First, interprotein water molecules are expelled to the bulk, resulting in a small increase in entropy, as the solvent entropy gain from the water release is nearly cancelled by the loss of side-chain entropies as the two proteins approach each other. At shorter distances, the two dry binding surfaces adapt to each other to optimize their interaction energy at the expense of further protein configurational entropy loss. Although the binding interfaces feature clusters of hydrophobic residues, overall, the protein-protein association in this system is driven by enthalpy and opposed by entropy.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006349520306019;6.3;6.2;6.2;00063495;S0006349520306019;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006349520306019;;

Here, we designed an Escherichia coli expression construct to achieve a milligram yield of recombinant Vpr. In addition, we fabricated a graphene field-effect transistor (G-FET) biosensor, with the modification of a supported lipid bilayer (SLB), to study the interaction between Vpr and its interaction partners. The Dirac point of the SLB/G-FET was observed to shift in response to the binding of Vpr to the SLB. By fitting the normalized shift of the Dirac point as a function of Vpr concentration to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation, we could extract the dissociation constant (Kd) to quantify the Vpr binding affinity. When the 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1-rac-glycerol) (DOPG) membrane was used as the SLB, the dissociation constant was determined to be 9.6 ± 2.1 M. In contrast, only a slight shift of the Dirac point was observed in response to the addition of Vpr when the 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) membrane was used as the SLB. Taking advantage of the much weaker binding of Vpr to the DOPC membrane, we prepared a human voltage-dependent anion channel isoform 1 (hVDAC-1)-embedded DOPC membrane as the SLB for the G-FET and used it to determine the dissociation constant to be 5.1 ± 0.9 M.

We and others have shown that SERINC5 incorporation into virions alters the Env structure and sensitizes the virus to broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting cryptic Env epitopes. We have also found that SERINC5 accelerates the loss of Env function over time compared to control viruses. However, the exact mechanism by which SERINC5 inhibits HIV-1 fusion is not understood. Here, we utilized 2D and 3D super-resolution microscopy to examine the effect of SERINC5 on the distribution of Env glycoproteins on single HIV-1 particles. We find that, in agreement with a previous report, Env glycoproteins form clusters on the surface of mature virions. Importantly, incorporation of SERINC5, but not SERINC2, which lacks antiviral activity, disrupted Env clusters without affecting the overall Env content. We also show that SERINC5 and SERINC2 also form clusters on single virions. Unexpectedly, Env and SERINC molecules exhibited poor codistribution on virions, as evidenced by much greater Env-SERINC pairwise distances compared to Env-Env distances. This observation is inconsistent with the previously reported interaction between Env and SERINC5 and suggests an indirect effect of SERINC5 on Env cluster formation. Collectively, our results reveal a multifaceted mechanism of SERINC5-mediated restriction of HIV-1 fusion that, aside from the effects on individual Env trimers, involves disruption of Env clusters, which likely serve as sites of viral fusion with target cells.;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.0c02699;23.9;23.4;23.5;19360851;;;;

This leads to inflammatory response finally culminating into neurocognitive dysfunction. In neuroAIDS, HIV-1 protein, transactivator of transcription (Tat) is detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of infected patients. Mortalin, a multifunctional protein, has anti-inflammatory role following its activation in various stress conditions. Recent studies demonstrate downregulation of mortalin in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we explored the mechanisms of mortalin in modulating HIV-1 Tat-mediated neuroinflammation. Methods: Expression of mortalin in autopsy section in normal and diseased individuals were examined using immunohistochemistry. To decipher the role of mortalin in HIV-1 Tat-induced activation, human fetal brain-derived astrocytes were transiently transfected with Tat and mortalin using expression vectors. HIV-1 Tat-mediated damage was analyzed using RT-PCR and western blotting. Modulatory role of mortalin was examined by coexpressing it with Tat, followed by examination of mitochondrial morphodynamics using biochemical assay and confocal and electron microscopy. Extracellular ATP release was monitored using luciferase assay. Neuroinflammation in astrocytes was examined using flow cytometry, dye based study, immunocytochemistry, immunoprecipitation, and western blotting. Indirect neuronal damage was also analyzed. Results: HIV-1 Tat downregulates the expression of mortalin in astrocytes, and this is corroborated with autopsy sections of HIV-1 patients. We found that overexpression of mortalin with Tat reduced inflammation and also rescued astrocytic-mediated neuronal death. Using bioinformatics, we discovered that binding of mortalin with Tat leads to Tat degradation and rescues the cell from neuroinflammation. Blocking of proteosomal pathway rescued the Tat degradation and revealed the ubiquitination of Tat. Conclusion: Overall, our data demonstrated the protective role of mortalin in combating HIV-1 Tat-mediated damage. We also showed that mortalin could degrade Tat through direct binding with HIV-1 Tat. Overexpression of mortalin in the presence of Tat could significantly reduce cytotoxic effects of Tat in astrocytes. Indirect neuronal death was also found to be rescued. Our in vitro findings were validated as we found attenuated expression of mortalin in the autopsy sections of HIV-1 patients.;https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-020-01912-3;8.4;8.4;9.4;;;;;

Effective treatment of HIV infection has reduced the rate of progression and severity but not the overall prevalence of HANDs, suggesting ongoing pathological process even when viral replication is suppressed. In this study, we investigated how HIV-1 protein Nef secreted in extracellular vesicles (exNef) impairs neuronal functionality. ExNef were rapidly taken up by neural cells in vitro, reducing the abundance of ABC transporter A1 (ABCA1) and thus cholesterol efflux and increasing the abundance and modifying lipid rafts in neuronal plasma membranes. ExNef caused a redistribution of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Tau to lipid rafts and increased the abundance of these proteins, as well as of A42 ExNef further potentiated phosphorylation of Tau and activation of inflammatory pathways. These changes were accompanied by neuronal functional impairment. Disruption of lipid rafts with cyclodextrin reversed the phenotype. Short-term treatment of C57BL/6 mice with either purified recombinant Nef or exNef similarly resulted in reduced abundance of ABCA1 and elevated abundance of APP in brain tissue. The abundance of ABCA1 in brain tissue of HIV-infected human subjects diagnosed with HAND was lower, and the abundance of lipid rafts was higher compared with HIV-negative individuals. Levels of APP and Tau in brain tissue correlated with the abundance of Nef. Thus, modification of neuronal cholesterol trafficking and of lipid rafts by Nef may contribute to early stages of neurodegeneration and pathogenesis in HAND.;http://www.jbc.org/lookup/doi/10.1074/jbc.RA120.014642;8.2;7.7;7.4;;;;;

All rights reserved.Nef is an HIV-encoded accessory protein that enhances pathogenicity by down-regulating major histocompatibility class I (MHC-I) expression to evade killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). A potent Nef inhibitor that restores MHC-I is needed to promote immune-mediated clearance of HIV-infected cells. We discovered that the plecomacrolide family of natural products restored MHC-I to the surface of Nef-expressing primary cells with variable potency. Concanamycin A (CMA) counteracted Nef at subnanomolar concentrations that did not interfere with lysosomal acidification or degradation and were nontoxic in primary cell cultures. CMA specifically reversed Nef-mediated down-regulation of MHC-I, but not CD4, and cells treated with CMA showed reduced formation of the Nef:MHC-I:AP-1 complex required for MHC-I down-regulation. CMA restored expression of diverse allotypes of MHC-I in Nefexpressing cells and inhibited Nef alleles from divergent clades of HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus, including from primary patient isolates. Lastly, we found that restoration of MHC-I in HIVinfected cells was accompanied by enhanced CTL-mediated clearance of infected cells comparable to genetic deletion of Nef. Thus, we propose CMA as a lead compound for therapeutic inhibition of Nef to enhance immune-mediated clearance of HIV-infected cells.;http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2008615117;17.1;16.1;15.7;00278424;;;;

We previously found that CCL2 neutralization in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) strongly inhibited HIV-1 replication affecting post-entry steps of the viral life cycle. Here, we used RNA-sequencing to deeply characterize the cellular factors and pathways modulated by CCL2 blocking in MDMs and involved in HIV-1 replication restriction. We report that exposure to CCL2 neutralizing antibody profoundly affected the MDM transcriptome. Functional annotation clustering of up-regulated genes identified two clusters enriched for antiviral defense and immune response pathways, comprising several interferon-stimulated, and restriction factor coding genes. Transcripts in the clusters were enriched for RELA and NFKB1 targets, suggesting the activation of the canonical nuclear factor B pathway as part of a regulatory network involving miR-155 up-regulation. Furthermore, while HIV-1 infection caused small changes to the MDM transcriptome, with no evidence of host defense gene expression and type I interferon signature, CCL2 blocking enabled the activation of a strong host innate response in infected macrophage cultures, and potently inhibited viral genes expression. Notably, an inverse correlation was found between levels of viral transcripts and of the restriction factors APOBEC3A (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 A), ISG15, and MX1. These findings highlight an association between activation of innate immune pathways and HIV-1 restriction upon CCL2 blocking and identify this chemokine as an endogenous factor contributing to the defective macrophage response to HIV-1. Therapeutic targeting of CCL2 may thus strengthen host innate immunity and restrict HIV-1 replication.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2020.02129/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;;;;

Until now, no information concerning provirus mutations of HTLV-2 and its consequences, as well as those of HTLV-1/2 in HIV-coinfected individuals, had been described. Therefore, we searched for these mutations in provirus samples of 44 HIV/HTLV-1- and 25 HIV/HTLV-2-coinfected individuals. Using protocols well established for amplification and sequencing of segments of the LTR, env, and tax regions, we searched for defective type 1 particles that retain LTRs and lack internal sequences and type 2 particles that lack the 5'LTR region. In addition, using as references the prototypes ATK (HTLV-1) and Mo (HTLV-2), we searched for point mutations in the LTR and synonyms and nonsynonymous mutations and non-sense mutations in env and tax regions. Defective HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 provirus type 1 or 2 was detected in 31.8% of HIV/HTLV-1- and 32.0% of HIV/HTLV-2-coinfected individuals. Synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations were identified mostly in HTLV-2 and associated with lower levels of specific antibodies. No non-sense mutations that resulted in premature termination of Env and Tax proteins were detected. On the contrary, mutation in the stop codon of Tax2a produced a long protein characteristic of the HTLV-2c subtype. The clinical significance of these mutations in coinfected individuals remains to be defined, but they confirmed the lower sensitivity of serological and molecular diagnostic tests in HIV/HTLV-1/2 coinfections.IMPORTANCE HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 are endemic to Brazil, and they have different effects in HIV/AIDS disease progression. HIV/HTLV-1 has been described as accelerating the progression to AIDS and death, while HIV/HTLV-2 slows the progression to AIDS. Provirus mutations of HTLV-1 were implicated in severe leukemia development and in problems in the diagnosis of HTLV-1; in contrast, provirus mutations of HTLV-2 had not been confirmed and associated with problems in HTLV-2 diagnosis or disease outcome. Nevertheless, data obtained here allowed us to recognize and understand the false-negative results in serologic and molecular tests applied for HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 diagnosis. Defective proviruses, as well as synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations, were associated with the diagnosis deficiencies. Additionally, since HIV-1 and HTLV-1 infect the same cells (CD4 positive), the production of HIV-1 pseudotypes with HTLV-1 envelope glycoprotein during HIV/HTLV-1 coinfection cannot be excluded. Defective provirus of HTLV-2 and Tax2c is speculated to influence progression to AIDS.";https://msphere.asm.org/content/5/5/e00923-20;2.4;4.0;5.9;;;;;

We proposed a bidirectional coupling model with standard incidence which includes the interaction of between-host transmission dynamics and within-host viral dynamics, and investigated the dynamic behaviors of the multiscale system on two time-scales. We found that the multiscale system exhibits more complex dynamics including backward bifurcation, which means that the usual thresholds for infection control or virus elimination obtained from the epidemiological model or virus dynamic model may not act as threshold parameter under a certain condition. There may be multiple epidemic equilibriums, one of which is stable, although the basic reproduction number is less than 1. We numerically examine the synergistic impact between the macro and micro dynamics. In particular, increasing the drug efficacy can decrease the prevalence of disease. The contact rate may affect the number and size of equilibria of viral dynamics model by inducing the occurrence of backward bifurcation. The finding suggests that the effective control measures may include both the reduction in contact rate or transmission rate at the population level and the increase in drug efficacy at the individual level, and using these control measures together can effectively control the diseases.;http://www.aimspress.com/article/10.3934/mbe.2020350;2.1;2.3;1.3;15471063;;;;

Using imaging and biochemical assays to track HIV-1 capsids in the nucleus during infection, we demonstrated that higher-order capsid complexes and/or complete cores containing the viral genome are imported into the nucleus. Inhibition of RT does not prevent capsid nuclear import; thus, RT may occur in nuclear compartments. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions of infected cells reveal that most RT intermediates are enriched in nuclear fractions, suggesting that HIV-1 RT occurs in the nucleus alongside uncoating. In agreement, we find that capsid in the nucleus induces recruitment of cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 6 (CPSF6) to SC35 nuclear speckles, which are highly active transcription sites, suggesting that CPSF6 through capsid is recruiting viral complexes to SC35 speckles for the occurrence of RT. Thus, nuclear import precedes RT and uncoating, which fundamentally changes our understanding of HIV-1 infection. Selyutina et al. show that HIV-1 cores containing the viral genome are imported into the nucleus for reverse transcription and uncoating.

Besides, data from developing settings including Ethiopia is still limited. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess HIV-1 genetic diversity and PDR mutations among ART-naive recently diagnosed HIV-1 infected individuals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods: Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from June to December 2018 in Addis Ababa among ART-naive recently diagnosed individuals. Partial HIV-1 pol region covering the entire protease (PR) and partial reverse transcriptase (RT) regions of 51 samples were amplified and sequenced using an in-house assay. Drug resistance mutations were examined using calibrated population resistance (CPR) tool version 6.0 from the Stanford HIV drug resistance database and the International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) 2019 mutation list. Results: According to both algorithms used, 9.8% (5/51) of analyzed samples had at least one PDR Mutation. PDR mutations to Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) were the most frequently detected (7.8% and 9.8%, according to the CPR tool and IAS-USA algorithm, respectively). The most frequently observed NNRTIs-associated mutations common to both algorithms were K103N (2%), Y188L (2%), K101E (2%), and V106A (2%), while E138A (2%) was observed according to IAS-USA only. Y115F and M184V (mutations that confer resistance to NRTIs) dual mutations were detected according to both criteria in a single study participant (2%). PDR mutation to protease inhibitors was found to be low (only G73S; 2% according to the CPR tool). Phylogenetic analysis showed that 98% (50/51) of the study participants were infected with HIV-1C virus while one individual (2%) was infected with HIV-1A1 virus. Conclusions: This study showed an increased level of PDR and persistence HIV-1C clade homogeneity after 15 years of the rollout of ART and 3 decades of HIV-1C circulation in Ethiopia, respectively. Therefore, we recommend routine baseline genotypic drug resistance testing for all newly diagnosed HIV infected patients before initiating treatment. This will aid the selection of appropriate therapy in achieving the 90% of patients having an undetectable viral load in consonance with the UN target.";https://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12977-020-00542-0;7.3;6.7;6.7;;;;;

HIV-1 susceptibility to SERINC5 is determined by sequences in the viral Env glycoprotein gp120, and the antiviral effect of SERINC5 is counteracted by the viral accessory protein Nef. While the precise mechanism by which SERINC5 inhibits HIV-1 infectivity is unclear, previous studies have suggested that SERINC5 affects Env conformation. To define the effects of SERINC5 on Env conformation, we quantified the binding of HIV-1 particles to immobilized Env-specific monoclonal antibodies. We observed that SERINC5 reduced the binding of HIV-1 particles bearing a SERINC5-susceptible Env to antibodies that recognize the V3 loop, a soluble CD4 (sCD4)-induced epitope, and an N-linked glycan. In contrast, SERINC5 did not alter the capture of HIV-1 particles bearing the SERINC5-resistant Env protein. Moreover, the effect of SERINC5 on antibody-dependent virus capture was abrogated by Nef expression. Our results indicate that SERINC5 inhibits HIV-1 infectivity by altering the conformation of gp120 on virions and/or physical masking of specific HIV-1 Env epitopes.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/20/e00594-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

These processes are facilitated by several host-cell factors, one of which is myo-inositol hexaphosphate (IP6). IP6 participates in the proper assembly of Gag into immature hexameric lattices and is incorporated into HIV-1 particles. Following maturation, IP6 is also likely to participate in stabilizing capsid protein-mediated mature hexameric lattices. Although a structural-functional analysis of the importance of IP6 in the HIV-1 life cycle has been reported, the effect of IP6 has not yet been quantified. Using two in vitro methods, we quantified the effect of IP6 on the assembly of immature-like HIV-1 particles, as well as its stabilizing effect during disassembly of mature-like particles connected with uncoating. We analyzed a broad range of molar ratios of protein hexamers to IP6 molecules during assembly and disassembly. The specificity of the IP6-facilitated effect on HIV-1 particle assembly and stability was verified by K290A, K359A, and R18A mutants. In addition to IP6, we also tested other polyanions as potential assembly cofactors or stabilizers of viral particles.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/20/e00991-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

Single-genome amplification (SGA) was used to generate partial HIV-1 polymerase genomes in paired CSF and plasma samples from 12 HIV-1-positive participants in the CNS HIV Antiretroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) study who were classified as neurocognitively unimpaired or with various degrees of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Subjects were viremic on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). HIV-1 DRMs and phylogenetic characteristics were determined using the Stanford HIVdb program and phylogenetic analyses. Individual DRMs were identified more frequently in plasma than in paired CSF (P = 0.0078). Significant differences in the ratios of DRMs in CSF and plasma were found in 3 individuals with HAND (3/ 7=43%). Two HAND subjects (2/7=29%) demonstrated one DRM in CSF not identified in paired plasma. Longitudinal analyses (n=4) revealed significant temporal differences in the ratios of DRMs in the compartments. Statistically significant differences in the frequency of DRMs in the CSF and plasma are readily found in those on nonsuppressive cART. While compartment-based DRM discordance was largely consistent with increased drug-selective pressures in the plasma, overrepresentation of DRMs in the central nervous system (CNS) can occur. Underlying mechanisms of HAND are complex and multifactorial. The clinical impact of DRM discordance on viral persistence and HAND pathogenesis remains unclear and warrants further investigation in larger, longitudinal cohorts.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/20/e01824-19;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

Because SELEX is a time-consuming procedure, the in silico design of specific aptamers has recently become a progressive approach. HIV-1 surface glycoprotein gp120, which is involved in the early stages of HIV-1 infection, is an attractive target for RNA and DNA aptamer selection. In this study, four single-stranded DNA aptamers, referred to as HD2, HD3, HD4, and HD5, that had the ability of HIV-1 inhibition were designed in silico. In a proposed non-SELEX approach, some parts of the B40 aptamer sequence, which interacted with gp120, were isolated and considered as a separate aptamer sequence. Then, to obtain the best docking scores of the HDOCK server and Hex software, some modifications, insertions, and deletions were applied to each selected sequence. Finally, the cytotoxicity and HIV inhibition of the selected aptamers were evaluated experimentally. Results demonstrated that the selected aptamers could inhibit HIV-1 infection by up to 80%, without any cytotoxicity.

However, the factors associated have not been well characterised in different settings. This study describes barriers and enablers of adherence to infant prophylaxis among 6-week-old HIV exposed infants in Lira district, Northern Uganda. Methods This prospective cohort study was conducted from 2018–2020 at the PMTCT clinic at Lira Regional Referral Hospital and included 472 mother-infant pairs. HIV-infected pregnant women were recruited, followed up at delivery and 6 weeks postpartum. We used a structured questionnaire to obtain data on socio-demographic, reproductive-related, HIV-related characteristics and adherence. Data were analysed using Stata to estimate adjusted risk ratios using Poisson regression models to ascertain barriers and enablers of adherence to infant nevirapine prophylaxis. Results Barriers to infant adherence are maternal characteristics including: younger age (20 years adjusted risk ratio (ARR) = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.1–2.2), missing a viral load test during pregnancy (ARR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1–1.7) and not receiving nevirapine syrup for the baby after childbirth (ARR = 6.2; 95% CI: 5.1–7.6). Enablers were: having attained 4 years of schooling (ARR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.5–0.9), taking a nevirapine-based regimen (ARR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4–0.9), long-term ART (60 months ARR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.6–0.9), accompanied by a husband to hospital during labour and childbirth (ARR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.4–0.7) and labour starting at night (ARR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.6–0.8). Conclusion and recommendations Despite mothers receiving nevirapine syrup from the health workers for the infant, nonadherence rates still prevail at 14.8%. The health system needs to consider giving HIV infected pregnant women the nevirapine syrup before birth to avoid delays and non-adherence. There is need to pay particular attention to younger women and those who recently started ART.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240529;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

Thus, we sought to determine CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell and CD4/CD8 ratio responses in a cohort of HIV infected individuals on sustained suppressive ART followed up for more than a decade. Methods The cohort comprised adult patients who started ART between 2001 and 2007 and followed for up to 14 years. Trends in median CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells and CD4/CD8 ratio were reviewed retrospectively. Poisson regression models were used to identify factors associated with achieving normalized T-cell biomarkers. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the probability of attaining normalized counts while on suppressive ART. Results A total of 227 patients with a median duration of follow-up on ART of 12 (IQR: 10.5-13.0) years were included. CD4 cell count increased from baseline median of 138 cells (IQR: 70- 202) to 555 cells (IQR: 417-830). CD4 cell increased continuously up until 5 years, after which it plateaued up until 14 years of follow up. Only 69.6% normalized their CD4 cell count within a median of 6.5 (IQR: 3.0-10.5) years. In addition, only 15.9% of the cohort were able to achieve the median reference CD4+ T-cell threshold count in Ethiopians (760 cells/L). CD8+ T-cell counts increased initially until year 1, after which continuous decrease was ascertained. CD4/CD8 ratio trend revealed continuous increase throughout the course of ART, and increased from a median baseline of 0.14 (IQR: 0.09-0.22) to a median of 0.70 (IQR: 0.42-0.95). However, only 12.3% normalized their ratio ( 1.0) after a median of 11.5 years. In addition, only 8.8% of the cohort were able to achieve the median reference ratio of healthy Ethiopians. Conclusion Determination of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, along with CD4/CD8 ratio is highly relevant in long-term follow-up of patients to assess immune recovery. Monitoring ratio levels may serve as a better biomarker risk for disease progression among patients on long-term ART. In addition, the findings emphasize the relevance of initiation of ART at the early stage of HIV-1 infection.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240880;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

Based on the optimized configurations, electronic excitation and emission were studied with the TD-DFT method. The energy behavior of A, B, and C have been examined in the THF solvent using the polarizable continuum (PCM) model. Molecular frontier orbital energy levels, UV–Vis spectra, heat maps, and fluorescence properties were investigated in detail. Furthermore, based on an analysis of hydrogen bonding interactions between HIV-1 protease and compound C, it can be concluded that C is expected to form a stable hydrogen bonding with ILE 50. All the work in this paper provides a theoretical basis for the research on pyrrol-2-ones.;http://link.springer.com/10.1134/S0036024420100313;1.0;1.0;1.1;00360244;;;;

Their structural behavior was investigated by means of UV, CD, fluorescence spectroscopy, and gel electrophoresis techniques in K+-containing buffers and water-ethanol blends. Particularly, we observed that the presence of the 5-(4-dimethylamino)azobenzene moiety leads TBA to form multimers instead of the typical monomolecular chair-like G-quadruplex and almost hampers T30695 G-quadruplex monomers to dimerize. Fluorescence studies evidenced that both the conjugated G-quadruplexes possess unique fluorescence features when excited at wavelengths corresponding to the UV absorption of the conjugated moiety. Furthermore, a preliminary investigation of the trans-cis conversion of the dye incorporated at the 5-end of TBA and T30695 showed that, unlike the free dye, in K+-containing water-ethanol-triethylamine blend the trans-to-cis conversion was almost undetectable by means of a standard UV spectrophotometer.;https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/19/7103;5.1;5.2;5.3;16616596;;;;

In line with this, Th17 cells represent selective HIV-1 infection targets mainly at mucosal sites, with long-lived Th17 subsets carrying replication-competent HIV-DNA during ART. Therefore, novel Th17-specific therapeutic interventions are needed as a supplement of ART to reach the goal of HIV remission/cure. Th17 cells express high levels of peroxisome pro-liferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARy), which acts as a transcriptional repressor of the HIV provirus and the rorc gene, which encodes for the Th17-specific master regulator RORyt. Thus, we hypothesized that the pharmacological inhibition of PPARy will facilitate HIV reservoir reactivation while enhancing Th17 effector functions. Consistent with this prediction, the PPARy antagonist T0070907 significantly increased HIV transcription (cell-associated HIV-RNA) and RORyt-mediated Th17 effector functions (IL-17A). Unexpectedly, the PPARy antagonism lim-ited HIV outgrowth from cells of ART-treated people living with HIV (PLWH), as well as HIV replication in vitro. Mechanistically, PPARy inhibition in CCR6+CD4+ T cells induced the upreg-ulation of transcripts linked to Th17-polarisation (RORyt, STAT3, BCL6 IL-17A/F, IL-21) and HIV transcription (NCOA1-3, CDK9, HTATIP2). Interestingly, several transcripts involved in HIV-restriction were upregulated (Caveolin-1, TRIM22, TRIM5, BST2, miR-29), whereas HIV permissiveness transcripts were downregulated (CCR5, furin), consistent with the decrease in HIV outgrowth/replication. Finally, PPARy inhibition increased intracellular HIV-p24 expression and prevented BST-2 downregulation on infected T cells, suggesting that progeny virion release is restricted by BST-2-dependent mechanisms. These results provide a strong rationale for consider-ing PPARy antagonism as a novel strategy for HIV-reservoir purging and restoring Th17-mediat-ed mucosal immunity in ART-treated PLWH.;https://paijournal.com/index.php/paijournal/article/view/348;0;0;0;;;;;

Several next generation influenza vaccines designed to elicit such bNAbs are also in clinical development. One of the common features of the isolated bNAbs is the use of restricted IgVH repertoire. More than 80% of stem-targeting bNAbs express IgVH1-69, which may indicate genetic constraints on the evolution of such antibodies. In the current study, we evaluated a panel of influenza virus bNAbs in comparison with HIV-1 MAb 4E10 and anti-RSV MAb Palivizumab (approved for human use) for autoreactivity using 30 normal human tissues microarray and human protein (>9000) arrays. We found that several human bNAbs (CR6261, CR9114, and F2603) reacted with human tissues, especially with pituitary gland tissue. Importantly, protein array analysis identified high-affinity interaction of CR6261 with the autoantigen “Enhancer of mRNA decapping 3 homolog” (EDC3), which was not previously described. Moreover, EDC3 competed with hemagglutinin for binding to bNAb CR6261. These autoreactivity findings underscores the need for careful evaluation of such bNAbs for therapeutics and stem-based vaccines against influenza virus.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/10/1140;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

Despite the limited efficacy of the RV144 trial in Thailand, there is still no vaccine candidate that has been proven successful. Consequently, great efforts have been made to improve HIV-1 antigens design and discover delivery platforms for optimal immune elicitation. Owing to immunogenic, structural, and functional diversity, virus-like particles (VLPs) could act as efficient vaccine carriers to display HIV-1 immunogens and provide a variety of HIV-1 vaccine development strategies as well as prime-boost regimes. Here, we describe VLP-based HIV-1 vaccine candidates that have been enrolled in HIV-1 clinical trials and summarize current advances and challenges according to preclinical results obtained from five distinct strategies. This mini-review provides multiple perspectives to help in developing new generations of VLP-based HIV-1 vaccine candidates with better capacity to elicit specific anti-HIV immune responses.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2020.573157/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;;;;

The longer the time to viral rebound, the more efficacious the therapy. In support of such an approach, mathematical models serve as a connection between the size of the latent reservoir and the time to HIV-1 rebound after treatment interruption. The simplest of such models assumes that a single successful latent cell reactivation event leads to observable viremia after a period of exponential viral growth. Here we consider a generalization developed by Pinkevych et al. and Hill et al. of this simple model in which multiple reactivation events can occur, each contributing to the exponential growth of the viral load. We formalize and improve the previous derivation of the dynamics predicted by this model, and use the model to estimate relevant biological parameters from SIV rebound data. We confirm a previously described effect of very early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation on the rate of recrudescence and the viral load growth rate after treatment interruption. We find that every day ART initiation is delayed results in a 39% increase in the recrudescence rate (95% credible interval: [18%, 62%]), and a 11% decrease of the viral growth rate (95% credible interval: [4%, 20%]). We show that when viral rebound occurs early relative to the viral load doubling time, a model with multiple successful reactivation events fits the data better than a model with only a single successful reactivation event.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008241;7.8;7.2;7.3;1553734X;;;;

Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) is an acute phase protein that has been implicated in neurodegeneration and is upregulated in a transgenic mouse model of HIV-associated brain injury. Here we show that LCN2 is significantly upregulated in neocortex of a subset of HIV-infected individuals with brain pathology and correlates with viral load in CSF and pro-viral DNA in neocortex. However, the question if LCN2 contributes to HIV-associated neurotoxicity or is part of a protective host response required further investigation. We found that the knockout of LCN2 in transgenic mice expressing HIVgp120 in the brain (HIVgp120tg) abrogates behavioral impairment, ameliorates neuronal damage, and reduces microglial activation in association with an increase of the neuroprotective CCR5 ligand CCL4. In vitro experiments show that LCN2 neurotoxicity also depends on microglia and p38 MAPK activity. Genetic ablation of CCR5 in LCN2-deficient HIVgp120tg mice restores neuropathology, suggesting that LCN2 overrides neuroprotection mediated by CCR5 and its chemokine ligands. RNA expression of 168 genes involved in neurotransmission reveals that neuronal injury and protection are each associated with genotype- and sex-specific patterns affecting common neural gene networks. In conclusion, our study identifies LCN2 as a novel factor in HIV-associated brain injury involving CCR5, p38 MAPK and microglia. Furthermore, the mechanistic interaction between LCN2 and CCR5 may serve as a diagnostic and therapeutic target in HIV patients at risk of developing brain pathology and neurocognitive impairment.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0889159120303329;10.7;11.0;10.7;08891591;S0889159120303329;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0889159120303329;;

Since proteins can serve as valuable biomarkers for health status and diseases states, and enable personalized medicine, sensitive and rapid detection of proteins is of paramount importance. Herein, we report a chemically functionalized conical shaped poly-(ethylene terephthalate) nanopore (PET nanopore) as a stochastic sensing element for detection of proteins at the single-molecule level. We demonstrate that the PET nanopore sensor is not only sensitive and selective, but also can differentiate proteins rapidly, offering the potential for label-free protein detection and characterization. Our developed PET nanopore sensing strategy not only provides a general platform for exploring fundamental protein dynamics and rapid detection of proteins at the single-molecule level, but also opens new avenues toward advanced deeper understanding of enzymes, development of more efficient biosensing technologies, and constructing novel biomimetic nanopore systems.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0956566320302840;14.2;15.8;17.6;09565663;S0956566320302840;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0956566320302840;;

However, HIV-1 evades vaccine-induced memory CD8+ T cell response by mechanisms that are not fully understood. Methods: We analyzed the temporal dynamics of CD8+ T cell recall activity and function during EcoHIV infection in a potent PD1-based vaccine immunized immunocompetent mice. Findings: Upon intraperitoneal EcoHIV infection, high levels of HIV-1 GAG-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes recall response reduced EcoHIV-infected cells significantly. However, this protective effect diminished quickly after seven days, followed by a rapid reduction of GAG-specific CD8+ T cell number and activity, and viral persistence. Mechanistically, EcoHIV activated dendritic cells (DCs) and myeloid cells. Myeloid cells were infected and rapidly expanded, exhibiting elevated PD-L1/-L2 expression and T cell suppressive function before day 7, and were resistant to CD8+ T cell-mediated apoptosis. Depletion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) reduced EcoHIV infection and boosted T cell responses. Interpretation: This study provides an overview of the temporal interplay of persistent virus, DCs, MDSCs and antigen-specific CD8+ T cells during acute infection. We identify MDSCs as critical gatekeepers that restrain antiviral T cell memory responses, and highlight MDSCs as an important target for developing effective vaccines against chronic human infections.

This phase 1 study in healthy adults investigated the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of long-acting parenteral (LAP) microsuspension formulations of doravirine administered as an intramuscular (IM) injection. Methods: After confirmation of tolerability and safety of oral doravirine, 36 participants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive IM doravirine 200 mg as Treatment A (1 × 1 mL, 20% [200 mg/mL] suspension), B (1 × 0.66 mL, 30% [300 mg/mL] suspension) or C (2 × 0.5 mL, 20% suspension). Blood samples were taken as venous plasma, venous dried blood spots (DBS) and fingerstick DBS. Results and discussion: Plasma concentration-time profiles following IM treatments demonstrated rapid initial doravirine release, with initial peak ~4 days post-injection, followed by decline over the next ~6 days; a second peak was reached at ~24-36 days, corresponding to prolonged and sustained release, with measurable concentrations up to Day 183. Treatment C was associated with highest peak concentrations and shortest time to maximum concentration. Elimination half-lives for all IM formulations were prolonged versus oral administration (~46-58 days vs ~11-15 hours). Oral doravirine and IM doravirine were generally well tolerated; injection-site pain was the most common adverse event for IM doravirine. Doravirine concentrations from DBS samples showed strong correlations to venous plasma concentrations. What is new and conclusions: Novel doravirine LAP IM injection formulations investigated in this study demonstrated sustained plasma doravirine concentrations over a course of >20 weeks.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpt.13182;3.3;3.3;3.5;02694727;;;;

Among the reasons for the expansion of these diseases and the appearance of new neuropathogens are globalization, global warming, and the increased proximity between humans and wild animals due to human activities such as deforestation. Neurotropism affecting normal brain function is shared by organisms such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Neuroinfections caused by these agents activate immune responses, inducing neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, and neurodegeneration. Purinergic signaling is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway associated with these neuropathologies. During neuroinfections, host cells release ATP as an extracellular danger signal with pro-inflammatory activities. ATP is metabolized to its derivatives by ectonucleotidases such as CD39 and CD73; ATP and its metabolites modulate neuronal and immune mechanisms through P1 and P2 purinergic receptors that are involved in pathophysiological mechanisms of neuroinfections. In this review we discuss the beneficial or deleterious effects of various components of the purinergic signaling pathway in infectious diseases that affect the CNS, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection, bacterial meningitis, sepsis, cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis, and malaria. We also provide a description of this signaling pathway in emerging viral infections with neurological implications such as Zika and SARS-CoV-2.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0889159120313015;10.7;11.0;10.7;08891591;S0889159120313015;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0889159120313015;;

HTLV-1 is the etiologic agent of the highly aggressive and currently incurable cancer adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and a neurological disease HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM)/tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP). BLV causes neoplastic proliferation of B cells in cattle: enzootic bovine leucosis (EBL). Despite the severity of these conditions, infection by HTLV-1 and BLV appear in most cases clinically asymptomatic. These viruses can undergo latency in their hosts. The silencing of proviral gene expression and maintenance of latency are central for the establishment of persistent infection, as well as for pathogenesis in vivo. In this review, we will present the mechanisms that control proviral activation and retroviral latency in deltaretroviruses, in comparison with other exogenous retroviruses. The 50 long terminal repeats (50-LTRs) play a main role in controlling viral gene expression. While the regulation of transcription initiation is a major mechanism of silencing, we discuss topics that include (i) the epigenetic control of the provirus, (ii) the cis-elements present in the LTR, (iii) enhancers with cell-type specific regulatory functions, (iv) the role of virally-encoded transactivator proteins, (v) the role of repressors in transcription and silencing, (vi) the effect of hormonal signaling, (vii) implications of LTR variability on transcription and latency, and (viii) the regulatory role of non-coding RNAs. Finally, we discuss how a better understanding of these mechanisms may allow for the development of more effective treatments against Deltaretroviruses.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/10/1079;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

However, macrophages are the only myeloid lineage cell commonly infected by SIVs and/or HIVs. The frequency of infected macrophages varies greatly across specific host and virus combinations as well as disease states, with infection rates being greatest in pathogenic SIV infections of non-natural hosts (i.e., Asian nonhuman primates (Asian NHPs)) and late in untreated HIV-1 infection. In contrast, macrophages from natural SIV hosts (i.e., African NHPs) are largely resistant to infection due to entry and/or post-entry restriction mechanisms. These highly variable rates of macrophage infection may stem from differences in the host immune environment, entry and post-entry restriction mechanisms, the ability of a virus to adapt to efficiently infect macrophages, and the pleiotropic effects of macrophage-tropism including the ability to infect cells lacking CD4 and increased neutralization sensitivity. Questions remain about the relationship between rates of macrophage infection and viral pathogenesis, with some evidence suggesting that elevated levels of macrophage infection may contribute to greater pathogenesis in non-natural SIV hosts. Alternatively, extensive infection of macrophages may only emerge in the context of high viral loads and immunodeficiency, making it a symptom of highly pathogenic infections, not a primary driver of pathogenesis.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/10/1077;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

CVC also strongly antagonizes C–C chemokine receptor type 2b (CCR2b), thereby it has potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. CVC is currently under clinical trials in the patients for treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, in which immune cell activation and dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in its pathogenesis. In this study, CVC was examined for its inhibitory effect on the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, in cell cultures and found to be a selective inhibitor of the virus. The 50% effective concentrations of CVC were 19.0 and 2.9 M in the assays based on the inhibition of virus-induced cell destruction and viral RNA levels in culture supernatants of the infected cells, respectively. Interestingly, the CCR5-specific antagonist maraviroc did not show any anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Although the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 inhibition by CVC remains to be elucidated, CCR2b does not seem to be its target molecule. Considering the fact that the regulation of excessive immune activation is required to treat COVID-19 patients at the late stage of the disease, CVC should be further pursued for its potential in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166354220303168;7.4;7.3;7.4;01663542;S0166354220303168;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0166354220303168;;

Herein, we studied whether Ets-2 regulates the expression of lymphotropic factors (LFs) NFAT2, NF-/p65, c-Jun, c-Fos, which regulate the activation/differentiation of T-cells, and kinase CDK10, which controls Ets-2 degradation and repression activity. In silico analysis revealed Ets-2 binding sites on the promoters of NFAT2, c-Jun, c-Fos. The T-cell lines Jurkat (models T-cell signaling/activation) and H938 (contains the HIV-1-LTR) were transfected with an Ets-2 overexpressing vector, in the presence/absence of mitogens. mRNA and protein levels were assessed by qPCR and Western immunoblotting, respectively. Ets-2 overexpression in unstimulated Jurkat increased NFAT2 and c-Jun mRNA/protein, c-Fos mRNA and NF-/p65 protein, and decreased CDK10 protein. In unstimulated H938, Ets-2 upregulated NFAT2, c-Jun and CDK10 mRNA/protein and NF-/p65 protein. In stimulated Jurkat, Ets-2 increased NFAT2, c-Jun and c-Fos mRNA/protein and decreased CDK10 mRNA/protein. In stimulated H938 Ets-2 increased NFAT2, c-Jun and c-Fos protein and reduced CDK10 protein levels. Furthermore, Ets-2 overexpression modulated the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes in both cell lines. Ets-2 upregulates the expression of key LFs involved in the activation of cytokine genes or HIV-1 in T-cells, either through its physical interaction with gene promoters or through its involvement in signaling pathways that directly impact their expression. The effect of Ets-2 on CDK10 expression in H938 vs Jurkat cells dictates that, additionally to Ets-2 degradation, CDK10 may facilitate Ets-2 repression activity in cells carrying the HIV-1-LTR, contributing thus to the regulation of HIV latency in virus-infected T-cells.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11033-020-05865-x;5.1;3.1;1.7;03014851;;;;

How can HIV-1 establish and maintain latency despite having a strong long terminal repeat (LTR)? We constructed panels of subgenomic reporter viral vectors with varying copy numbers of NF-B motifs (0 to 4 copies) and examined the profile of latency establishment in Jurkat cells. Surprisingly, we found that the stronger the viral promoter, the faster the latency establishment. Importantly, at the time of commitment to latency and subsequent points, Tat levels in the cell were not limiting. Using highly sensitive strategies, we demonstrate the presence of Tat in the latent cell, recruited to the latent LTR. Our data allude, for the first time, to Tat establishing a negative feedback loop during the late phases of viral infection, leading to the rapid silencing of the viral promoter.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/19/e00503-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

One is the CRF03_AB, which circulated in the region since late 1990s and probably became widespread in northwestern FSU countries. However, there is not much information provided about the dissemination of this recombinant. Here, we examine the prevalence, evolutionary dynamics and dispersion pattern of HIV-1 CRF03_AB recombinant. Methods We analyzed 32 independent studies and 151 HIV-1 CRF03_AB pol sequences isolated from different FSU countries over a period of 22 years. Pooled prevalence was estimated using a random effects model. Bayesian coalescent-based method was used to estimate the evolutionary, phylogeographic and demographic parameters. Results Our meta-analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of CRF03_AB infection in northwestern FSU region was 5.9% [95%CI: 4.1–7.8]. Lithuania (11.6%), Russia (5.9%) and Belarus (2.9%) were the most affected by CRF03_AB. We found that early region wide spread of HIV-1 CRF03_AB originated from one viral clade that arose in the city of Kaliningrad in 1992 [95%HPD: 1990–1995]. Fourteen migration route of this variant were found. The city of Kaliningrad is involved in most of these, confirming its leading role in CRF03_AB spread within FSU. Demographic reconstruction point to this is that CRF03_AB clade seems to have experienced an exponential growth until the mid-2000s and a decrease in recent years. Conclusion These data provide new insights into the molecular epidemiology of CRF03_AB as well as contributing to the fundamental understanding of HIV epidemic in FSU.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241269;5.7;5.4;5.2;;;;;

LVs hold notable and inherent advantages over other gene transfer agents based on their ability to transduce non-dividing cells, permanently transform target cell genome, and allow stable, long-term transgene expression. LV systems based on non-human lentiviruses are attractive alternatives to conventional HIV-1-based LVs due to their lack of pathogenicity in humans. This article reviews non-human lentiviruses and highlights their unique characteristics regarding virology and molecular biology. The LV systems developed based on these lentiviruses, as well as their successes and shortcomings, are also discussed. As the field of gene therapy is advancing rapidly, the use of LVs uncovers further challenges and possibilities. Advances in virology and an improved understanding of lentiviral biology will aid in the creation of recombinant viral vector variants suitable for translational applications from a variety of lentiviruses.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/10/1106;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

HIV Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British HIV AssociationObjectives: We aimed to study the incidence rate, predictors and outcomes of HIV care interruption (HCI) in Belgium. Methods: We analysed data for adult patients with at least two HIV care records in the Belgian HIV cohort between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2016. An HCI episode was defined as 1 year without an HIV care record. The HCI incidence rate was analysed using Poisson regression, return to HIV care using a cumulative incidence function with death as a competing risk, and viral load (VL) status upon return to HIV care using logistic regression. Results: We included 16 066 patients accounting for 78 625 person-years of follow-up. The incidence rate of HCI was 5.3/100 person-years [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.1–5.4/100 person-years]. The incidence of return to HIV care after HCI was estimated at 77.5% (95% CI 75.7–79.2%). Of those who returned to care, 43.7% had a VL  200 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL, suggesting care abroad or suboptimal care (without an HIV-related care record) in Belgium during the HCI, and 56.3% returned without controlled VL and were therefore considered as having experienced a real gap in HIV care; they represented 2.3/100 person-years of follow-up. Factors individually associated with HCI were no antiretroviral therapy (ART) uptake, lower age, injecting drug use, non-Belgian nationality, male gender, not being a man who has sex with men, a shorter time since HIV diagnosis, no high blood pressure and CD4 count ' 350 cells/µL. Conclusions: This study highlights the need to investigate return to care and viral status at return, to better understand HCI. Identified predictors can help health care workers to target patients at higher risk of HCI for awareness and support.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hiv.12901;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;;

From then the concept of accessory or auxiliary protein for Vpr has emerged and it is still used to date. However, Vpr soon appeared to be very important for in vivo virus spread and pathogenesis. Vpr has been involved in many biological functions including regulation of reverse transcriptase activity, the nuclear import of the pre-integration complex (PIC), HIV-1 transcription, gene splicing, apoptosis and in cell cycle arrest. Thus, we might rather consider Vpr as a true virulence factor instead of just an accessory factor. At present, Vpr can be regarded as a potential and promising target in different strategies aiming to fight infected cells including latently infected cells.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006295220303646;8.4;6.2;7.5;00062952;S0006295220303646;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006295220303646;;

We report a case of a young woman with a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic stroke. The patient had history of HIV-1 infection, with periods of therapeutic non-compliance. Initial computed tomography (CT) imaging studies showed stenosis of the M1 segment of the left MCA, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed infarction of the MCA territory. Serial transcranial Doppler ultrasound revealed progressive occlusion of the MCA and stenosis of the left anterior cerebral artery. Systemic investigation for other causes of stroke was normal. Lumbar puncture revealed a mildly inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid, and HSV-2 DNA was identified by PCR, with a positive viral load in favor of active replication. No other viral or microbiological infections were identified. MRI angiography confirmed a vasculitic process involving the left carotid artery, and a HSV-2 vasculitis diagnosis was assumed. The patient started acyclovir with improvement of clinical features and imaging abnormalities. In the HIV-infected patient, stroke is a multifactorial common cause of morbidity. The physician should take into account a broad differential diagnosis including rare causes and atypical presentations of common etiologies, including HSV-1 and HSV-2 CNS infection.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13365-020-00894-5;5.0;4.6;4.7;13550284;;;;

In this patient population subtype B predominates but an increasing presence of non-B subtypes has been reported. We aimed to define to what extent the increasing subtype heterogeneity in a high at risk population induces the formation and spread of new recombinant forms. The study focused on transmission networks that reflect the local transmission to an important extent. One hundred and five HIV-1 transmission clusters were identified after phylogenetic analysis of 2849 HIV-1 pol sequences generated for the purpose of baseline drug resistance testing between 2013 and 2017. Of these 105 clusters, 62 extended in size during the last two years and were therefore considered as representing ongoing transmission. These 62 clusters included 774 patients in total. From each cluster between 1 and 3 representative patients were selected for near full-length viral genome sequencing. In total, the full genome sequence of 101 patients was generated. Indications for the presence of a new recombinant form were found for 10 clusters. These 10 clusters represented 105 patients or 13.6% of the patients covered by the study. The findings clearly show that new recombinant strains highly contribute to local transmission, even in an epidemic that is largely MSM and subtype B driven. This is an evolution that needs to be monitored as reshuffling of genome fragments through recombination may influence the transmissibility of the virus and the pathology of the infection. In addition, important changes in the sequence of the viral genome may challenge the performance of tests used for diagnosis, patient monitoring and drug resistance analysis.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567134820301969;5.2;4.9;5.0;15671348;S1567134820301969;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1567134820301969;;

It has also been shown that lipid peroxidation upregulates b-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression and subsequently promotes Ab peptide production. In the present study, we examined whether chronic exposure to the anti-HIV drugs tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and nevirapine induces lipid peroxidation thereby promoting BACE1 and Ab generation and consequently impair cognitive function in mice. Methods: TDF or nevirapine was orally administered to female BALB/c mice once a day for 8 weeks. On the 7th week of treatment, spatial learning and memory were assessed using the Morris water maze test. The levels of lipid peroxidation, BACE1, amyloid b 1-42 (Ab1-42) and Ab deposits were measured in the hippocampal tissue upon completion of treatment. Results: Chronic administration of nevirapine induced spatial learning and memory impairment in the Morris water maze test, whereas TDF did not have an effect. TDF and nevirapine administration increased hippocampal lipid peroxidation and Ab1-42 concentration. Nevirapine further upregulated BACE1 expression and Ab deposits. Conclusion: Our results suggest that chronic exposure to TDF and nevirapine contributes to hippocampal lipid peroxidation and Ab accumulation, respectively, as well as spatial learning and memory deficits in mice even in the absence of HIV infection. These findings further support a possible link between ARV drug toxicity, Ab accumulation and the persistence of HANDs.;https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0924270820000198/type/journal_article;3.5;4.5;4.3;09242708;S0924270820000198;;;

HIV-1 integrase (IN) is essential for the concerted integration of HIV-1 DNA into the host genome. IN further contributes to HIV-1 RNA binding, which is required for HIV-1 maturation. Non-catalytic-site integrase inhibitors (NCINIs) have been developed as allosteric IN inhibitors, which perform anti- HIV-1 activity by a multimodal mode of action such as inhibition of the IN-lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)/p75 interaction in the early stage and disruption of functional IN multimerization in the late stage of HIV-1 replication. Here, we show that IN undergoes an adaptable conformational change to escape from NCINIs. We observed that NCINI-resistant HIV-1 variants have accumulated 4 amino acid mutations by passage 26 (P26) in the IN-encoding region. We employed highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thermal stability assays, and X-ray crystallographic analysis to show that some amino acid mutations affect the stability and/or dimerization interface of the IN catalytic core domains (CCDs), potentially resulting in the severely decreased multimerization of full-length IN proteins (IN undermultimerization). This undermultimerized IN via NCINI-related mutations was stabilized by HIV-1 RNA and restored to the same level as that of wild-type HIV-1 in viral particles. Recombinant HIV-1 clones with IN undermultimerization propagated similarly to wild-type HIV-1. Our study revealed that HIV-1 can eventually counteract NCINI-induced IN overmultimerization by IN undermultimerization as one of the escape mechanisms. Our findings provide information on the understanding of IN multimerization with or without HIV-1 RNA and may influence the development of anti- HIV-1 strategies.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/19/e00486-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

HIV Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British HIV AssociationObjectives: Although outcomes of antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials, experiences from subpopulations defined by age, CD4 count or viral load (VL) in heterogeneous real-world settings are limited. Methods: The study design was an international multicohort collaboration. Logistic regression was used to compare virological and immunological outcomes at 12 ± 3 months after starting ART with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), contemporary nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or boosted protease inhibitor (PI/b) with two nucleos(t)ides after 1 January 2012. The composite treatment outcome (cTO) defined success as VL ' 200 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL with no regimen change and no AIDS/death events. Immunological success was defined as a CD4 count ' 750 cells/L or a 33% increase where the baseline CD4 count was  500 cells/L. Poisson regression compared clinical failures (AIDS/death  14 days after starting ART). Interactions between ART class and age, CD4 count, and VL were determined for each endpoint. Results: Of 5198 ART-naïve persons in the International Cohort Consortium of Infectious Diseases (RESPOND), 45.4% started INSTIs, 26.0% PI/b and 28.7% NNRTIs; 880 (17.4%) were aged ' 50 years, 2539 (49.4%) had CD4 counts ' 350 cells/L and 1891 (36.8%) had VL ' 100 000 copies/mL. Differences in virological and immunological success and clinical failure among ART classes were similar across age groups ( 40, 40–50 and ' 50 years), CD4 count categories ( 350 vs. ' 350 cells/L) and VL categories at ART initiation ( 100 000 vs. ' 100 000 copies/mL), with all investigated interactions being nonsignificant (P ' 0.05). Conclusions: Differences among ART classes in virological, immunological and clinical outcomes in ART-naïve participants were consistent irrespective of age, immune suppression or VL at ART initiation. While confounding by indication cannot be excluded, this provides reassuring evidence that such subpopulations will equally benefit from contemporary ART.";https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hiv.12888;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;;

Study design: In a study performed across two Singapore hospitals, adult participants meeting WHO 2009 criteria for probable dengue (fever >37.5 °C plus two other clinical or haematological criteria) were identified at hospital outpatient clinics from April 2012 to July 2013. Eligible participants were asked for informed consent to complete a questionnaire on HIV risk factors, as well as HIV testing by OraQuick®, fourth-generation EIA and NAAT. Dengue testing was by Dengue Duo NS1Ag + Ab Combo kits. Confirmed dengue was defined as NS1-positive and probable dengue as IgM-positive. Results: Of 152 eligible patients, 82 consented to inclusion in the study. Fifty-two of these had dengue; 43 confirmed and 9 probable cases. All patients with dengue had a negative OraQuick® result, negative EIA and undetectable HIV-1 RNA, corresponding to a specificity of 100 %.

The “shock and kill” approach entails stimulating viral production with latency-reversing agents followed by the killing of cells actively producing the virus by immune clearance. However, this approach does not induce all intact proviruses, leaving a residual reservoir. CRISPR/Cas9 has been utilized to excise integrated Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) DNA from infected cells in an RNA-guided, sequence-specific manner. Here, we seek to epigenetically silence the proviral DNA by introducing nuclease-deficient disabled Cas9 (dCas9) coupled with a transcriptional repressor domain derived from Kruppel-associated box (KRAB). We show that specific guide RNAs (gRNAs) and dCas9-KRAB repress HIV-1 transcription and reactivation of latent HIV-1 provirus. This repression is correlated with chromatin changes, including decreased H3 histone acetylation and increased histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation, histone marks that are associated with transcriptional repression. dCas9-KRAB-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 transcription suggests that CRISPR can be engineered as a tool for block-and-lock strategies.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/10/1154;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) evades adaptive immunity by means of its extremely high mutation rate, which allows the HIV envelope glycoprotein to continuously escape from the action of antibodies. However, some broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting specific viral regions show the ability to block the infectivity of a large number of viral variants. The discovery of these antibodies opens new avenues in anti-HIV therapy; however, they are still suboptimal tools as their amplitude of action ranges between 50% and 90% of viral variants. In this context, being able to discriminate between sensitive and resistant strains to an antibody would be of great interest for the design of optimal clinical antibody treatments and to engineer potent bNAbs for clinical use. Here, we describe a hierarchical procedure to predict the antibody neutralization efficacy of multiple viral isolates to three well-known anti-CD4bs bNAbs: VRC01, NIH45-46 and 3BNC117. Our method consists of simulating the three-dimensional binding process between the gp120 and the antibody by using Protein Energy Landscape Exploration (PELE), a Monte Carlo stochastic approach. Our results clearly indicate that the binding profiles of sensitive and resistant strains to a bNAb behave differently, showing the latter’s weaker binding profiles, that can be exploited for predicting antibody neutralization efficacy in hypermutated HIV-1 strains.";https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/12/10/2392;3.2;3.0;3.7;;;;;

Here, we show that the late HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu hijacks DNA repair mechanisms to promote degradation of nuclear viral cDNA in cells that are already productively infected. Vpu achieves this by interacting with RanBP2–RanGAP1*SUMO1–Ubc9 SUMO E3-ligase complexes at the nuclear pore to reprogramme promyelocytic leukaemia protein nuclear bodies and reduce SUMOylation of Bloom syndrome protein, unleashing end degradation of viral cDNA. Concomitantly, Vpu inhibits RAD52-mediated homologous repair of viral cDNA, preventing the generation of dead-end circular forms of single copies of the long terminal repeat and permitting sustained nucleolytic attack. Our results identify Vpu as a key modulator of the DNA repair machinery. We show that Bloom syndrome protein eliminates nuclear HIV-1 cDNA and thereby suppresses immune sensing and proviral hyper-integration. Therapeutic targeting of DNA repair may facilitate the induction of antiviral immunity and suppress proviral integration replenishing latent HIV reservoirs.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0753-6;9.3;16.5;23.2;;;;;

Its C-terminus consists of the nucleocapsid (NC) domain that interacts with nucleic acids, and p1 and p6, two unstructured regions, p6 containing the motifs to bind ALIX, the cellular ESCRT factor TSG101 and the viral protein Vpr. The processing of Gag by the viral protease subsequently liberates NCp15 (NC-p1-p6), NCp9 (NC-p1) and NCp7, NCp7 displaying the optimal chaperone activity of nucleic acids. This review focuses on the nucleic acid binding properties of the NC domain in the different maturation states during the HIV-1 viral cycle.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/10/1109;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

The recommended dose is 100 mg once daily. This review summarizes the pharmacokinetics of doravirine, the influence of intrinsic factors, and its drug–drug interaction (DDI) profile. Following oral administration, doravirine is rapidly absorbed (median time to maximum plasma concentration, 1–4 h) and undergoes cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A-mediated oxidative metabolism. Steady-state geometric means for AUC0–24, C24, and Cmax in individuals with HIV-1 following administration of doravirine 100 mg once daily are 37.8 M·h, 930 nM, and 2260 nM, respectively. Age, gender, severe renal impairment, and moderate hepatic impairment have no clinically meaningful effect on doravirine pharmacokinetics, and there is limited potential for DDIs. No dose adjustment is necessary when doravirine is co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors. However, doravirine is contraindicated with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin), and dose adjustment of doravirine is recommended for co-administration with the moderate CYP3A inducer, rifabutin. Included in this review are clinical trial data from phase I pharmacokinetic trials, including DDI trials and trials in participants with renal and hepatic disease but without HIV-1 infection (N = 326), as well as phase I, II, and III safety and efficacy trials in participants living with HIV-1 (N = 991). Based on these data, the pharmacokinetic profile of doravirine supports its use in diverse populations living with HIV-1 and allows co-administration with various antiretroviral agents and treatments for commonly occurring co-morbidities.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40261-020-00934-2;3.7;3.5;3.9;11732563;;;;

Here, we report the 96-week data for the study. Methods: This randomised, open-label, non-inferiority phase 3 trial, was done at two research sites in Johannesburg, South Africa, after participant recruitment from 11 public health clinics also in Johannesburg. Eligible participants were aged 12 years or older with HIV-1 infection, who weighed at least 40 kg, had no antiretroviral exposure in the previous 6 months, with a creatinine clearance of more than 60 mL/min (>80 mL per min in individuals aged <19 years), and a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of 500 copies per mL or higher. Individuals who were pregnant or had tuberculosis were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by study staff using a computerised randomisation system. Randomisation was stratified by age (12 and <19 years and 19 years). Participants were randomly assigned to once-daily oral fixed-dose combination tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg, and once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg; once-daily oral fixed-dose combination tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg, and once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg; or once-daily oral fixed-dose combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and efavirenz 600 mg. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants who had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of less than 50 copies per mL at week 48, which has been reported previously. Here, we report the key secondary efficacy endpoint of the proportion of participants who had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of less than 50 copies per mL at the week 96 visit, assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of any study drug, with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%. Safety data, including clinical, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and laboratory data, are also reported. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03122262. Findings: Between Jan 17, 2017, and May 14, 2018, we screened 1453 individuals, of whom 1053 were enrolled: 351 participants were randomly assigned to the tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, 351 to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, and 351 to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz group. All participants received at least one dose of study medication and were included in the primary analysis. At week 96, 276 (79%) of 351 participants in the tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, 275 (78%) of 351 participants in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, and 258 (74%) of 351 participants in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz group had achieved a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of less than 50 copies per mL. Non-inferiority was established in all three comparisons. The proportion of patients with protocol-defined virological failure at week 96 was low in all treatment groups. Participants in the tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group had fewer changes in bone density than the two other treatment groups. Mean weight gain was substantial (7·1 kg [SD 7·4] in the tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group; 4·3 kg [6·7] in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, and 2·3 kg [7·0] in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz group), and was greater among women than men. Ten (3%) of 351 participants in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz group discontinued due to treatment-related adverse events, of which liver dysfunction (n=4) and rash (n=4) were most common. Interpretation: Medium-term and long-term metabolic and clinical consequences of the considerable increase in bodyweight observed in participants given these antiretroviral regimens and the trajectory of this weight gain over time, especially among women, require further study.

Microparticles are elevated in disorders associated with thrombosis (e.g., cardiovascular diseases). We investigated the association between microparticle levels in untreated and treated HIV-infected subjects, and determined the association with immune status, viral replication, and duration of antiretroviral therapy. Patients and methods: We included 144 HIV-infected subjects, including 123 on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 21 before treatment initiation. A control group of 40 HIV-negative healthy adults matched for age and sex was used for comparison of microparticle levels. Treated subjects were divided into five groups depending on the period of antiretroviral exposure. Statistically significant differences were determined by Kruskal–Wallis test and Chi2 test. The relation between microparticles and other parameters was assessed using Spearman's coefficient of correlation. Results: Microparticle levels were significantly higher in treated and untreated HIV-infected subjects than in non-HIV-infected controls (P < 0.001). The microparticle level was similar between the groups on treatment (P = 0.913). No association between the microparticle level and CD4+ count, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, number of HIV-1 RNA copies, or duration of exposure to antiretroviral treatment was observed. Conclusion: Increased levels of microparticles may be due to processes independent of viral replication and CD4+ cell count, and microparticle release might persist even during viral suppression by antiretroviral treatment. Elevated microparticle levels might occur in response to other triggers.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0399077X18309442;1.8;1.0;1.1;0399077X;S0399077X18309442;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0399077X18309442;;

Here, we show that beyond its effects on microtubule acetylation, EB1 also indirectly contributes to infection by delivering the plus-end tracking protein (+TIP), cytoplasmic linker protein 170 (CLIP170) to the cell periphery. CLIP170 bound to intact HIV-1 cores or in vitro assembled capsid–nucleocapsid complexes, while EB1 did not. Moreover, unlike EB1 and several other +TIPs, CLIP170 enhanced infection independently of effects on microtubule acetylation. Capsid mutants and imaging revealed that CLIP170 bound HIV-1 cores in a manner distinct from currently known capsid cofactors, influenced by pentamer composition or curvature. Structural analyses revealed an EB-like +TIP-binding motif within the capsid major homology region (MHR) that binds SxIP motifs found in several +TIPs, and variability across this MHR sequence correlated with the extent to which different retroviruses engage CLIP170 to facilitate infection. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the complex roles of +TIPs in mediating early stages of retroviral infection, and reveal divergent capsid-based EB1 mimicry across retroviral species.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.15252/embj.2020104870;15.0;15.5;16.4;02614189;;;;

As a step towards a cure for HIV, this study aimed to develop an approach that reactivates HIV-1 latently infected cells by employing a drug delivery system using immunoliposomes targeting CD4+ T cells. The immunoliposomes were examined for physicochemical properties and determined for their potential stability. A histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA was used as a model drug being encapsulated within the immunoliposomes that are conjugated with anti-CD4 antibodies. The immunoliposomes are effectively and specifically taken up by the CD4+ J-Lat 10.6 cells, and significantly less so by the CD4 ACH-2 cells. For HIV-1 latent cell reactivation, SAHA-encapsulated immunoliposomes (SAHA-IL) and SAHA-encapsulated liposomes (SAHA-LP) can reactivate HIV latency as effectively as SAHA compound alone. Additionally, a combination of SAHA-IL and a protein kinase C activator, bryostatin-1, also exhibits a synergistic effect on the reactivation. The developed system thus presents a viable option to become a promising approach for HIV-1 latency reversing treatment, a strategy towards developing a functional cure for HIV.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022354920303324;5.3;6.1;5.5;00223549;S0022354920303324;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0022354920303324;;

A total of 261 HIV-1-positive plasma samples, confirmed by the Suzhou CDC, were collected and evaluated to detect HIV-1 drug resistance genotypes using an in-house method. The pol gene fragment was amplified, and its nucleic acid sequence was determined by Sanger sequencing. Drug resistance mutations were then analyzed using the Stanford University HIV resistance database (https://hivdb.stanford.edu). A total of 216 pol gene fragments were amplified and sequenced with 16.7% (36/216) of sequences revealing these mutations. The drug resistance rates of protease, nucleoside reverse transcriptase, and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) were 4/36 (11.1%), 2/36 (5.6%), and 30/36 (83.3%), respectively. Five surveillance drug resistance mutations were found in 36 sequences, of which, three were found among specimens of men who have sex with men. Potential low-level resistance accounted for 33% of amino acid mutations associated with NNRTIs. Two of the mutations, M230L and L100I, which confer a high level of resistance efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP) used as NNRTIs for first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART), were detected in this study. Therefore, when HIV-1 patients in Suzhou are administered fist-line ART, much attention should be paid to the status of these mutations that cause resistance to EVP, EFV, and NVP.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11262-020-01774-0;3.0;3.1;3.4;09208569;;;;

It was named CRF106_cpx (this is temporary as we have not received the circulating recombinant form [CRF] number from HIV databases). After sequencing and analyzing of the near full-length genome, we found that CRF106_cpx was generated by three B segments and two CRF01_AE segments inserted into the C backbone. There was quite a bit of diversity between sequences of CRF106_cpx, so this seems to be a CRF that has been spreading for many years.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2020.0101;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;;

Here, we compared the -potential of human blood EVs (BEVs) and semen EVs (SEVs) from 26 donors that were HIV-infected (HIV+, n = 13) or HIV uninfected (HIV-, n = 13). We found that, compared to BEVs that bear neutral surface charge, SEVs were significantly more negatively charged, even when BEVs and SEVs were from the same individual. Comparison of BEVs and SEVs from HIV- and HIV+ groups revealed subtle HIV-induced alteration in the -potential of EVs, with the effect being more significant in SEVs (-potential = 8.82 mV, p-value = 0.0062) than BEVs (-potential = 1.4 mV, p-value = 0.0462). These observations were validated by differences in the isoelectric point (IEP) of EVs, which was in the order of HIV + SEV  HIV-SEV HIV + BEV  HIV-BEV. Functionally, the rate and efficiency of SEV internalization by the human cervical epithelial cell line, primary peripheral blood lymphocytes, and primary blood-derived monocytes were significantly higher than those of BEVs. Mechanistically, removal of sialic acids from the surface of EVs using neuraminidase treatment significantly decreased SEV's surface charge, concomitant with a substantial reduction in SEV's internalization. The neuraminidase effect was independent of HIV infection and insignificant for BEVs. Finally, these results were corroborated by enrichment of glycoproteins in SEVs versus BEVs. Taken together, these findings uncover fundamental tissue-specific differences in surface electrostatic properties of EVs and highlight the critical role of surface charge in EV/target cell interactions.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/10/1117;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

This is a Gold Open Access article under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 licenseBackground: Bioinformatically designed mosaic antigens increase the breadth of HIV vaccine-elicited immunity. This study compared the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a newly developed, tetravalent Ad26 vaccine with the previously tested trivalent formulation. Methods: This randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 1/2a study (TRAVERSE) was done at 11 centres in the USA and one centre in Rwanda. Eligible participants were adults aged 18 to 50 years, who were HIV-uninfected, healthy at screening based on their medical history and a physical examination including laboratory assessment and vital sign measurements, and at low risk of HIV infection in the opinion of study staff, who applied a uniform definition of low-risk guidelines that was aligned across sites. Enrolled participants were randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to tetravalent and trivalent groups. Participants in tetravalent and trivalent groups were then further randomly assigned at a 5:1 ratio to adenovirus 26 (Ad26)-vectored vaccine and placebo subgroups. Randomisation was stratified by region (USA and Rwanda) and based on a computer-generated schedule using randomly permuted blocks prepared under the sponsor's supervision. We masked participants and investigators to treatment allocation throughout the study. On day 0, participants received a first injection of tetravalent vaccine (Ad26.Mos4.HIV or placebo) or trivalent vaccine (Ad26.Mos.HIV or placebo), and those injections were repeated 12 weeks later. At week 24, vaccine groups received a third dose of tetravalent or trivalent together with clade C gp140, and this was repeated at week 48, with placebos again administered to the placebo group. All study vaccines and placebo were administered by intramuscular injection in the deltoid muscle. We assessed adverse events in all participants who received at least one study injection (full analysis set) and Env-specific binding antibodies in all participants who received at least the first three vaccinations according to the protocol-specified vaccination schedule, had at least one measured post-dose blood sample collected, and were not diagnosed with HIV during the study (per-protocol set). This study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02788045. Findings: Of 201 participants who were enrolled and randomly assigned, 198 received the first vaccination: 110 were in the tetravalent group, 55 in the trivalent group, and 33 in the placebo group. Overall, 185 (93%) completed two scheduled vaccinations per protocol, 180 (91%) completed three, and 164 (83%) completed four. Solicited, self-limiting local, systemic reactogenicity and unsolicited adverse events were similar in vaccine groups and higher than in placebo groups. All participants in the per-protocol set developed clade C Env binding antibodies after the second vaccination, with higher total IgG titres after the tetravalent vaccine than after the trivalent vaccine (10 413 EU/mL, 95% CI 7284–14 886 in the tetravalent group compared with 5494 EU/mL, 3759–8029 in the trivalent group). Titres further increased after the third and fourth vaccinations, persisting at least through week 72. Other immune responses were also higher with the tetravalent vaccine, including the magnitude and breadth of binding antibodies against a cross-clade panel of Env antigens, and the magnitude of IFN ELISPOT responses (median 521 SFU/106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs] in the tetravalent group and median 282 SFU/106 PBMCs in the trivalent group after the fourth vaccination) and Env-specific CD4+ T-cell response rates after the third and fourth vaccinations. No interference by pre-existing Ad26 immunity was identified. Interpretation: The tetravalent vaccine regimen was generally safe, well-tolerated, and found to elicit higher immune responses than the trivalent regimen. Regimens that use this tetravalent vaccine component are being advanced into field trials to assess efficacy against HIV-1 infection.

Recently, the role of immune activation in HIV disease progression and response to treatment is being investigated. This study focused on the expression of CD38 and HLA-DR on lymphocyte subsets in various groups of HIV-infected individuals and to determine their association with HIV-1 disease progression. Methods: Ninety-eight cases of patients with HIV/AIDS in different disease stages and twenty-four healthy HIV-negative individuals were included in the cross-sectional study. Their immune function and abnormal immune activation markers (CD38 & HLA-DR) were detected using a flowcytometer, and HIV-1 RNA levels in individuals receiving antiretroviral drugs were estimated. Results: The immune activation marker levels were significantly different between patients with different disease stages (P < 0.001). A significant negative correlation was observed between peripheral blood CD4+ T cell counts and immune activation markers. Also, a significant positive correlation was observed between HIV-1 RNA levels and CD38+CD8+ T lymphocyte. Conclusion: Immune activation markers (CD38 & HLA-DR) increase with disease progression. CD38+ on CD8+ T lymphocyte correlates well with HIV1 RNA levels in individuals failing on antiretroviral therapy.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S037712371930070X;1.2;1.4;1.2;03771237;S037712371930070X;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S037712371930070X;;

METHODS: We performed a case series of all PWH sequentially admitted with COVID-19 from 8 March 2020 to 23 April 2020 at three hospitals in Atlanta, Georgia. Sociodemographic, clinical and HIV-associated characteristics were collected. RESULTS: Of 530 confirmed COVID-19 cases hospitalized during this period, 20 occurred among PWH (3.8%). The median age was 57 (Q1-Q3, 48-62) years, 65% were men, and 85% were non-Hispanic Black. Presenting median symptom duration was 5 (Q1-Q3, 3-7) days; cough (90%), fever (65%), malaise (60%) and dyspnea (60%) were most common. On admission, 40% of patients required oxygenation support and 65% had an abnormal chest radiograph. Median length of hospitalization was 5 (Q1-Q3, 4-12) days, 30% required intensive care, 15% required intubation, and 15% died. Median CD4 cell count prior to admission was 425 (Q1-Q3, 262-815) cells/l and 90% of patients had HIV-1 RNA less than 200 copies/ml. Half of the patients had at least five comorbidities; hypertension (70%), dyslipidemia (60%) and diabetes (45%) were most prevalent. All three patients who died had CD4 cell count more than 200, HIV suppression and each had a total of five comorbidities. CONCLUSION: The multisite series in the Southern United States provides characteristics and early outcomes of hospitalized PWH with COVID-19. Nearly all patients had controlled HIV and a high comorbidity burden.

However, the protective efficacy of vaccine-elicited polyclonal antibodies has not previously been demonstrated in adoptive transfer studies in nonhuman primates. In this study, we show that passive transfer of purified antibodies from vaccinated macaques can protect naive animals against SIVmac251 challenges. We vaccinated 30 rhesus macaques with Ad26-SIV Env/Gag/Pol and SIV Env gp140 protein vaccines and assessed the induction of antibody responses and a putative protective signature. This signature included multiple antibody functions and correlated with upregulation of interferon pathways in vaccinated animals. Adoptive transfer of purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) from the vaccinated animals with the most robust protective signatures provided partial protection against SIVmac251 challenges in naive recipient rhesus macaques.

Objectives of the study were to determine prevalence of HIV-DNA < 100 copies/106 PBMCs in blood and to identify factors associated with this in a cohort of HIV-1-infected subjects treated with ART and with undetectable viral load (VL). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study on chronic HIV-1-infected people living with HIV (PLWH) followed up at the Department of Infectious Diseases of San Raffaele Scientific Institute on current ART without change for 12 months, with available pre-ART HIV-RNA and with undetectable VL for 12 months. HIV-DNA was amplified and quantified by real-time PCR (ABI Prism 7900); limit of detectability was 100 copies/106 PBMCs. Logistic regression was used to identify predictive factors for HIV-DNA < 100 copies/106 PBMCs. RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-eight PLWH were considered in the analyses, 119 (25%) with HIV-DNA < 100 copies/106 PBMCs. At multivariate analysis, we found that PLWH with lower zenith HIV-RNA, higher nadir CD4 and a shorter time between HIV diagnosis and ART start were more likely to have HIV-DNA < 100 copies/106 PBMCs, after adjustment for age, gender, calendar year of ART start, type of current ART regimen, percentage time spent with undetectable VL since ART start, current CD4 and CD4/CD8 ratio. CONCLUSIONS: In our chronic PLWH on virological suppression for 4 years, the prevalence of HIV-DNA < 100 copies/106 PBMCs was found to be 25%. Lower zenith HIV-RNA, shorter time between HIV diagnosis and starting ART and higher CD4 nadir were independently associated with low HIV-DNA.";https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/10/2994/5862744;8.7;7.7;8.3;;;;;

Recent data show that 34 million people are living with HIV-1 worldwide. HIV-1 infections can lead to AIDS which still causes nearly 20,000 deaths annually in the USA alone. As this retrovirus leads to high morbidity and mortality conditions, more effective therapeutic regimens must be developed to treat these viral infections. A key target for intervention for which there are no current FDA-approved modulators is at the point of proviral transcription. One successful method for identifying novel therapeutics for treating infectious diseases is the repurposing of pharmaceuticals that are approved by the FDA for alternate indications. Major benefits of using FDA-approved drugs include the fact that the compounds have well established toxicity profiles, approved manufacturing processes, and immediate commercial availability to the patients. Here, we demonstrate that pharmaceuticals previously approved for other indications can be utilized to either activate or inhibit HIV-1 proviral transcription. Specifically, we found febuxostat, eltrombopag, and resveratrol to be activators of HIV-1 transcription, while mycophenolate was our lead inhibitor of HIV-1 transcription. Additionally, we observed that the infected cells of lymphoid and myeloid lineage responded differently to our lead transcriptional modulators. Finally, we demonstrated that the use of a multi-dose regimen allowed for enhanced activation with our transcriptional activators.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/10/1067;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

Strong evidence supports S-Equol (SE) as an efficacious adjunctive neuroprotective and/or neurorestorative therapeutic for neurocognitive impairments in adult ovariectomized female HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) rats. There remains, however, a critical need to assess the therapeutic efficacy of SE when treatment occurs at an earlier age (i.e., resembling a therapeutic for children with PHIV) and across the factor of biological sex. Utilization of a series of signal detection operant tasks revealed prominent, sex-dependent neurocognitive deficits in the HIV-1 Tg rat, characterized by alterations in stimulus-reinforcement learning, the response profile, and temporal processing. Early (i.e., postnatal day 28) initiation of SE treatment precluded the development of chronic neurocognitive impairments in all (i.e., 100%) HIV-1 Tg animals, albeit not for all neurocognitive domains. Most notably, the therapeutic effects of SE are generalized across the factor of biological sex, despite the presence of endogenous hormones. Results support, therefore, the efficacy of SE as a neuroprotective therapeutic for chronic neurocognitive impairments in the post-cART era; an adjunctive therapeutic that demonstrates high efficacy in both males and females. Optimizing treatment conditions by evaluating multiple factors (i.e., age, neurocognitive domains, and biological sex) associated with PHIV and HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) affords a key opportunity to improve the therapeutic efficacy of SE.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13365-020-00886-5;5.0;4.6;4.7;13550284;;;;

We aimed to report the non-inferior efficacy of dolutegravir compared with efavirenz 400 mg at week 96. Methods: We did a multicentre, randomised, open label, phase 3 trial in in three hospitals in Yaoundé, Cameroon, in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral-naive adults with an HIV RNA viral load of greater than 1000 copies per mL to compare dolutegravir 50 mg with efavirenz 400 mg (reference treatment), both combined with lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02777229 and is ongoing. Findings: Between July, 2016, and August, 2019, of 820 patients assessed, 613 were randomly assigned to receive at least one dose of study medication, with 310 in the dolutegravir group and 303 in the efavirenz 400 mg group. At week 96 in the intention-to-treat analysis, 229 (74%) of 310 patients receiving dolutegravir and 219 (72%) of 303 patients receiving efavirenz, achieved plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL (difference 1·6%, 95% CI 5·4 to 8·6; p=0.66). Viral load suppression was reached significantly more rapidly in the dolutegravir group (p<0·001). Virological failure (>1000 copies per mL) was observed in 27 patients (eight in the dolutegravir group, among which, three women switched to efavirenz 600 mg because of the dolutegravir teratogeneicity signal, and 19 in the efavirenz 400 mg group). No acquired resistance mutations to dolutegravir were observed against 17 mutations to efavirenz with or without mutations to lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate among the 19 efavirenz 400 mg participants with virological failure. Weight gain was greater in the dolutegravir group (median weight gain, 5·0 kg in the dolutegravir group and 3·0 kg in the efavirenz 400 mg group, p<0·001, and incidence of obesity, 22% in the dolutegravir group and 16% in the efavirenz 400 mg group, p=0·043). The incidence of new WHO HIV-related stage 3 and 4 events was similar in each group (12 [4%] in each group). The two groups had similar rates of serious adverse events (28 [9%] of 310 in the dolutegravir group and 21 [7%] of 303 in the efavirenz 400 mg group). 18 deaths were observed during the 96-week follow-up (eight in the dolutegravir group and ten in the efavirenz 400 mg group). Interpretation: The non-inferior efficacy of the dolutegravir-based regimen and non-emergence of dolutegravir resistance at 96 weeks supports its use as a first-line regimen for antiretroviral-naive adults with HIV-1 infection. Viral load suppression was reached more quickly in the dolutegravir group and weight gain was significantly higher.

HIV-1 molecular diagnosis in children before 18 months of age require, two independent samples to confirm a result. However, some patients have discordant virologic results in different samples, raising uncertainty for a conclusive diagnosis. We defined these patients as “special pediatric cases”. Objectives: The aim of our study was to characterize the “special pediatric cases” among HIV-1 infected children diagnosed in a five-year period at our laboratory and evaluate the impact on the time to HIV-1 diagnosis. Study design: A total of 44 perinatally HIV-1 infected infants with molecular diagnostic performed at the Pediatric Garrahan Hospital were analyzed from 2013 to 2017. Results: We identified eight “special pediatric cases”. In the first samples, all of them had negative results by different DNA-PCR assays. Three infants had undetectable plasma viral load (pVL), four had low detectable pVL value, and one infant had no available pVL. All samples with detectable pVL, including those with low pVL (ie: 65copies/mL), had high pVL values at the end of the diagnosis. Considering the age of the HIV-1 infected children at the end of the diagnosis, five “special pediatric cases” (62 %) had a “late” positive diagnosis [mean (range) = 146 (89–268) days old]. Conclusions: These “special pediatric cases” are not as unusual as previously thought and are important diagnostic challenges. Also, this study add evidence to include the viral load assay in the molecular diagnostic algorithm for perinatal HIV-1 infection.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1386653220300858;5.7;6.0;5.9;13866532;S1386653220300858;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1386653220300858;;

A total of 2812 individuals were studied, 924 from south-central, 1116 from south-east and 772 from south-west Cameroon. Of 208 (7.4%) samples that were confirmed for HIV-1 infection all belong to HIV-1 group M. In all sites and in all age categories, HIV-1 prevalence was higher in women (160/1599 (10.0%)) as compared to men (48/1213 (4.0%)) with the highest prevalence in women aged between 25 and 34 years (>17%). For 188/208 (92.3%) HIV-1 positive individuals, a fragment of the pol gene was successfully amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed predominance of CRF02_AG (58%), a large diversity of subtypes (A, D, F2 and G), nine different CRFs and more than 12% URFs. Interestingly, 35/188 (18.6%) HIV-1 strains form 12 recent transmission chains. The majority of the clusters are composed of two (n = 8) or three (n = 3) sequences but one cluster included ten HIV-1 strains from women living in four different villages on a major road for logging concessions in the south-east (60 km distance). In the three regions of Cameroon where the ancestors of the four HIV-1 groups have been transmitted to humans, we observed a high HIV prevalence, especially in the southeast where HIV-1 M originated. Many factors allowing rapid establishment in the human population and subsequent rapid spread to urban areas of a new retrovirus or other pathogens of zoonotic origin are now present. Our study shows clearly that some rural areas should also be considered as hot-spots for HIV infection. Prevention efforts together with growing access to HIV diagnosis and antiretroviral treatment are urgently needed in these remote areas.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567134820301891;5.2;4.9;5.0;15671348;S1567134820301891;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1567134820301891;;

We analysed time to viral suppression according to ART regimen started in a cohort of patients diagnosed with EHI. Methods: Clinical records of individuals consecutively diagnosed with EHI between July 2016-June 2018 were reviewed. The distribution of clinical, virological and immunological factors was compared in treatment groups using the Mann–Whitney U-test. Results: 262 individuals (97% MSM) were diagnosed with EHI. 58% of patients agreed to start ART within 14 days of diagnosis. Tenofovir-based combinations were prescribed to all patients. DRV/b was the most commonly prescribed third agent (78%), when genotypic resistance testing was not available at time of ART choice. Switching to INSTI was encouraged once VRT became available and 27% switched from DRV/b to INSTI (mainly RAL) within 28 days from ART start. Those receiving INSTI were more likely to have a baseline viral load exceeding 1 million HIV-1 RNA copies/mL compared with those starting with DRV/b. Rapid start with INSTI regimens resulted in quicker viral suppression than when DRV/b was chosen in EHI, even when that was subsequently switched to INSTI. Retention in care following rapid ART start was achieved by all patients at 24 weeks. Conclusions: Starting an INSTI-based ART combination was associated with quicker viral suppression than when a protease inhibitor-based combination was chosen. No differences in the achievement of viral suppression or in retention in care were observed.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hiv.12900;5.6;5.3;5.8;14642662;;;;

Published by FEBS Press and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Cervicovaginal secretions, or their components collected, are referred to as cervicovaginal lavage (CVL). CVL constituents have utility as biomarkers and play protective roles in wound healing and against HIV-1 infection. However, several components of cervicovaginal fluids are less well understood, such as extracellular RNAs and their carriers, for example, extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs comprise a wide array of double-leaflet membrane extracellular particles and range in diameter from 30 nm to over one micron. The aim of this study was to determine whether differentially regulated CVL microRNAs (miRNAs) might influence retrovirus replication. To this end, we characterized EVs and miRNAs of primate CVL during the menstrual cycle and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of macaques. EVs were enriched by stepped ultracentrifugation, and miRNA profiles were assessed with a medium-throughput stem-loop/hydrolysis probe qPCR platform. Whereas hormone cycling was abnormal in infected subjects, EV concentration correlated with progesterone concentration in uninfected subjects. miRNAs were present predominantly in the EV-depleted CVL supernatant. Only a small number of CVL miRNAs changed during the menstrual cycle or SIV infection, for example, miR-186-5p, which was depleted in retroviral infection. This miRNA inhibited HIV replication in infected macrophages in vitro. In silico target prediction and pathway enrichment analyses shed light on the probable functions of miR-186-5p in hindering HIV infections via immunoregulation, T-cell regulation, disruption of viral pathways, etc. These results provide further evidence for the potential of EVs and small RNAs as biomarkers or effectors of disease processes in the reproductive tract.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2211-5463.12952;3.5;2.8;3.0;;;;;

The obtained derivatives have been fully characterized by a whole set of instrumental techniques in order to determine their chemical structure. Moreover, their electrochemical properties, investigated by cyclic voltammetry, revealed the presence of three reversible reduction waves for both hybrids. Furthermore, Transmission Electron Microscopy studies allowed to determine the morphology and size of the fullerene hybrids in aqueous solution, showing a tendency to organize into spherical nanoscale structures. Theoretical calculations using the DFT-PBE method and 6-311G(d,p) basis set, were performed to predict the most stable conformations for the synthesized compounds, and to determine the factors that control the geometry of these hybrid molecules. In addition, parameters such as polarity, and lipophilicity were estimated.

Vaginal film is becoming more acceptable and a convenient dosage form compared to cream, gel and suppository. Extremely poor aqueous solubility of efavirenz (EFV) limits its use as vaginal microbicide. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a monomeric surfactant free, rapidly soluble vaginal film of EFV (EZ film). EZ film was prepared using a tetrafunctional block polymer (Tetronic 1107), carrageenan and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) by solvent evaporation method. First, different solubilizers were screened for EFV solubility, in vitro cytotoxicity and cell membrane integrity assay on HeLa cells. Optimized film was characterized for solid state, mechanical strength, epithelial integrity, in vitro drug release in simulated vaginal fluid (SVF), simulated seminal fluid (SSF) and in vitro anti-HIV activity. Optimized EZ film showed a particle size of 48 ± 3.8 nm with PDI of 0.299. Differential scanning colorimetry (DSC) thermogram suggested the complete amorphization of EFV within the film. EZ film rapidly disintegrated (30 s) with complete release of EFV in SVF and SSF. The film was found to be non-toxic to HeLa cells and showed similar anti-HIV-1 activity as that of EFV in DMSO. EZ film did not show any significant change in the TEER value in HEC 1A cell line. Hence, the findings from the current study strongly suggest that the EZ film could be a cost-effective and convenient dosage form for PrEP of HIV.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0927776520305300;7.2;7.0;7.1;09277765;S0927776520305300;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0927776520305300;;

Polymorphisms in CCR5 regulate CCR5 expression, which, in turn, influences HIV infection acquisition and subsequent disease progression. Among these polymorphisms, a 32-bp deletion in the CCR5 open reading frame (CCR5 32) and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter (-2459G/A) are the most well-characterized polymorphisms. CCR5 32 provides partial to full protection against HIV infection and, therefore, serves as a basis for gene deletion studies attempting to achieve a permanent HIV cure. Recent studies have discovered that certain SNPs in the CCR region, not within CCR5, also affect CCR5 expression, HIV infection, and disease progression. Although these studies provide further valuable information regarding the role of human genetic variation in HIV/AIDS, they did not incorporate -2459G/A. In this article, the author summarizes the knowledge gained through the discovery of these new SNPs and introduces the idea that by not incorporating -2459G/A, less comprehensive conclusions may have been reached. Until a strategy that delivers a cure to the millions is found, every piece of information that may help curtail the HIV/AIDS threat to public health should be considered useful.;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aid.2020.0060;3.3;3.2;3.4;08892229;;;;

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The N4-methylation of cytidine (m4C and m42C) in RNA plays important roles in both bacterial and eukaryotic cells. In this work, we synthesized a series of m4C and m42C modified RNA oligonucleotides, conducted their base pairing and bioactivity studies, and solved three new crystal structures of the RNA duplexes containing these two modifications. Our thermostability and X-ray crystallography studies, together with the molecular dynamic simulation studies, demonstrated that m4C retains a regular C:G base pairing pattern in RNA duplex and has a relatively small effect on its base pairing stability and specificity. By contrast, the m42C modification disrupts the C:G pair and significantly decreases the duplex stability through a conformational shift of native Watson-Crick pair to a wobble-like pattern with the formation of two hydrogen bonds. This double-methylated m42C also results in the loss of base pairing discrimination between C:G and other mismatched pairs like C:A, C:T and C:C. The biochemical investigation of these two modified residues in the reverse transcription model shows that both mono- or di-methylated cytosine bases could specify the C:T pair and induce the G to T mutation using HIV-1 RT. In the presence of other reverse transcriptases with higher fidelity like AMV-RT, the methylation could either retain the normal nucleotide incorporation or completely inhibit the DNA synthesis. These results indicate the methylation at N4-position of cytidine is a molecular mechanism to fine tune base pairing specificity and affect the coding efficiency and fidelity during gene replication.;https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/18/10087/5907967;19.7;20.2;21.1;;;;;

In contrast, results from the few CAR T-cell studies for infectious diseases such as HIV-1 have been less convincing. These challenges are likely due to the low level of antigen present in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-suppressed patients in contrast to those with hematologic malignancies. Using our well-established nonhuman primate model of ART-suppressed HIV-1 infection, we tested strategies to overcome these limitations and challenges. We first optimized CAR T-cell production to maintain central memory subsets, consistent with current clinical paradigms. We hypothesized that additional exogenous antigen might be required in an ART-suppressed setting to aid expansion and persistence of CAR T cells. Thus, we studied 4 simian/HIV-infected, ART-suppressed rhesus macaques infused with virus-specific CD4CAR T cells, followed by supplemental infusion of cell-associated HIV-1 envelope (Env). Env boosting led to significant and unprecedented expansion of virus-specific CAR+ T cells in vivo; after ART treatment interruption, viral rebound was significantly delayed compared with controls (P = .014). In 2 animals with declining CAR T cells, rhesusized anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody was administered to reverse PD-1-dependent immune exhaustion. Immune checkpoint blockade triggered expansion of exhausted CAR T cells and concordantly lowered viral loads to undetectable levels. These results show that supplemental cell-associated antigen enables robust expansion of CAR T cells in an antigen-sparse environment. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show expansion of virus-specific CAR T cells in infected, suppressed hosts, and delay/control of viral recrudescence.";https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/136/15/1722/461264/Robust-expansion-of-HIV-CAR-T-cells-following;18.1;18.0;18.6;;;;;

The ease of culture, low contamination risk with human pathogens and high expression capacity makes an attractive platform to generate virus-like particles (VLPs). The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) has been frequently used to produce these complex nanoparticles. However, the BEVS entails several difficulties in the downstream phase as well as undesirable side-effects due to the expression of baculovirus-derived proteins. In this work, we developed a baculovirus-free system based on polyethylenimine (PEI)-mediated transient gene expression (TGE) of Sf9 cells. An exhaustive study of DNA:PEI polyplex formation was performed and the optimal TGE conditions were determined by the combination of Design of Experiments (DoE) and desirability functions. The TGE approach was successfully applied to produce three model recombinant products with different structural complexities, including eGFP, hSEAP and HIV-1 Gag VLPs. Cell membrane co-localization with the Gag polyprotein was detected by fluorescence microscopy, whereas nanoparticle tracking analysis and flow virometry were applied as high-throughput techniques to monitor the VLP production process. Analysis of VLP production revealed that 48 h after transfection were optimal for VLP harvesting since the ratio of VLPs to extracellular vesicles was the highest. In these conditions, a maximum of 1.9 ± 0.8·109 VLP/mL was achieved, representing a 2.8-fold increase compared to the initial transfection condition. In conclusion, the TGE approach proposed in this study provides a baculovirus-free platform to rapidly produce VLPs and potentially other recombinant products in insect cells.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S016816562030184X;4.8;5.4;6.2;01681656;S016816562030184X;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S016816562030184X;;

This study aims to examine the risk factors associated with HBV, HCV and HIV among people who used methamphetamine. Methods: People who ever used methamphetamine were identified from five National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohorts, 2007 to 2016. The outcome was either positive or negative for blood-borne viruses as identified from laboratory tests. Weighted statistics for the combined ten years of data were calculated by multiplying the weighted variable for laboratory measurements by 0.2. We examined the association of sexual activities (sexual partners, sexual identity), drug use behaviors (poly-drug use, injection drug use, frequency of drug use, age started using methamphetamine), demographics, and socio-economic status with blood-borne viruses using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models. Results: There were 1132 participants representing approximately 11,996,319 persons who ever used methamphetamine in the U.S. Blood-borne viruses' positive rate was 13.0 per 100,000. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed significant associations of blood-borne infections with age 40-49 years (vs. age 20-29 years, adjusted odds ratio 4.77, 95% CI 1.11-20.55), age 50-59 years (vs. age 20-29 years, 10.25, 2.40-43.82), living within poverty index 1-1.9 (vs. poverty index > = 2, 2.55; 1.19-5.49), living below the poverty threshold (vs. poverty index > = 2, 2.55; 1.11-5.86), having lower than high school education (vs. equal or higher than high school education, 3.13; 1.51-6.46), sexual identity as other than heterosexual (vs. heterosexual, 5.60; 1.72-18.28), using methamphetamine and heroin and cocaine (vs. using methamphetamine alone, 4.24; 1.06-16.92), injection drug use (vs. no injection drug use, 3.15; 1.61-6.16), and started using methamphetamine at age above 25 (vs. started using methamphetamine at age between 10 and 17, 2.09; 1.01-4.35).

The activity of the retroviral-IRESs requires IRES-transacting factors (ITAFs), being hnRNP A1, a known ITAF for the HIV-1 IRES. In this study, we show that hnRNP A1 is also an ITAF for the HTLV-1 and MMTV IRESs. The MMTV IRES proved to be more responsive to hnRNP A1 than either the HTLV-1 or the HIV-1 IRESs. The impact of post-translational modifications of hnRNP A1 on HIV-1, HTLV-1 and MMTV IRES activity was also assessed. Results show that the HIV-1 and HTLV-1 IRESs were equally responsive to hnRNP A1 and its phosphorylation mutants S4A/S6A, S4D/S6D and S199A/D. However, the S4D/S6D mutant stimulated the activity from the MMTV-IRES to levels significantly higher than the wild type hnRNP A1. PRMT5-induced symmetrical di-methylation of arginine residues of hnRNP A1 enabled the ITAF to stimulate the HIV-1 and HTLV-1 IRESs while reducing the stimulatory ability of the ITAF over the MMTV IRES. We conclude that retroviral IRES activity is not only dependent on the recruited ITAFs but also relies on how these proteins are modified at the post-translational level.;https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/18/10479/5909926;19.7;20.2;21.1;;;;;

Nevertheless, inextricable systemic immune activation and chronic inflammation despite viral suppression render patients still at higher risk of HIV-1-associated non-AIDS complications. Immunometabolism has nowadays raised more and more attention for that targeting metabolism may become a promising approach to modulate immune system and play a role in treating cancer, HIV-1 infection and autoimmune diseases. HIV-1 mainly infects CD4+ T cells and accumulating evidence has brought to light the association between T cell metabolism reprogramming and HIV-1 pathogenesis. Here, we will focus on the interplay of glycometabolism reprogramming of T cells and HIV-1 infection, making an effort to delineate the possibility of utilizing immunometabolism as a new target towards HIV-1 management and even sterilizing cure through eliminating viral reservoir.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2020.572677/full;6.8;4.5;5.4;;;;;

Despite progress in characterizing and inhibiting these processes, in situ mechanistic and structural studies remain challenging. This is because these operations are executed by individual viral preintegration complexes deep within cells. We therefore reconstituted and imaged the early stages of HIV-1 replication in a cell-free system. HIV-1 cores released from permeabilized virions supported efficient, capsid-dependent endogenous reverse transcription to produce double-stranded DNA genomes, which sometimes looped out from ruptured capsid walls. Concerted integration of both viral DNA ends into a target plasmid then proceeded in a cell extract–dependent reaction. This reconstituted system uncovers the role of the capsid in templating replication.;https://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abc8420;49.4;47.1;45.3;;;;;

Neither agent's activity depends on protein kinase C; nor do they inhibit class I/II histone deacetylases. However, they are differentially modulated by oxidative stress and metal ions and induce distinct patterns of global gene expression from established LRAs.

This small dsRNA abundantly produced by B. subtilis could be studied further for its application as an anti-viral therapeutic agent.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0141813020335583;5.5;6.0;6.9;01418130;S0141813020335583;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0141813020335583;;

All Rights Reserved.Small-molecule viral entry inhibitors, such as BMS-626529 (BMS-529), allosterically block CD4 binding to HIV-1 envelope (Env) and inhibit CD4-induced structural changes in Env trimers. Here, we show that the binding of BMS-529 to clade C soluble chimeric gp140 SOSIP (ch.SOSIP) and membrane-bound trimers with intact transmembrane domain (gp150) prevented trimer conformational transitions and enhanced their immunogenicity. When complexed to BMS-529, ch.SOSIP trimers retained their binding to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and to their unmutated common ancestor (UCA) antibodies, while exposure of CD4-induced (CD4i) non-bNAb epitopes was inhibited. BMS-529-complexed gp150 trimers in detergent micelles, which were isolated from CHO cells, bound to bNAbs, including UCA and intermediates of the CD4 binding site (bs) CH103 bNAb lineage, and showed limited exposure of CD4i epitopes and a glycosylation pattern with a preponderance of high-mannose glycans. In rabbits, BMS-529-complexed V3 glycan-targeting ch.SOSIP immunogen induced in the majority of immunized animals higher neutralization titers against both autologous and select high mannose-bearing heterologous tier 2 pseudoviruses than those immunized with the noncomplexed ch.SOSIP. In rhesus macaques, BMS-529 complexed to CD4 bs-targeting ch.SOSIP immunogen induced stronger neutralization against tier 2 pseudoviruses bearing high-mannose glycans than noncomplexed ch.SOSIP trimer immunogen. When immunized with gp150 complexed to BMS-529, rhesus macaques showed neutralization against tier 2 pseudoviruses with targeted glycan deletion and high-mannose glycan enrichment. These results demonstrated that stabilization of Env trimer conformation with BMS-529 improved the immunogenicity of select chimeric SOSIP trimers and elicited tier 2 neutralizing antibodies of higher potency than noncomplexed trimers. IMPORTANCE Soluble forms of HIV-1 envelope trimers exhibit conformational heterogeneity and undergo CD4-induced (CD4i) exposure of epitopes of non-neutralizing antibodies that can potentially hinder induction of broad neutralizing antibody responses. These limitations have been mitigated through recent structure-guided approaches and include trimer-stabilizing mutations that resist trimer conformational transition and exposure of CD4i epitopes. The use of small-molecule viral inhibitors that allosterically block CD4 binding represents an alternative strategy for stabilizing Env trimer in the pre-CD4-triggered state of both soluble and membrane-bound trimers. In this study, we report that the viral entry inhibitor BMS-626529 restricts trimer conformational transition and improves the immunogenicity of select Env trimer immunogens.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/21/e00958-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

TRIM5 is best known as a species-specific restriction factor that directly inhibits the viral life cycle. Additionally, it is also a patternrecognition receptor (PRR) that activates inflammatory signaling. How TRIM5 carries out its multi-faceted actions in antiviral defense remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that proteins required for autophagy, a cellular self-digestion pathway, play an important role in TRIM5's function as a PRR. Genetic depletion of proteins involved in all stages of the autophagy pathway prevented TRIM5-driven expression of NF-B and AP1 responsive genes. One of these genes is the preeminent antiviral cytokine interferon  (IFN-), whose TRIM5-dependent expression was lost in cells lacking the autophagy proteins ATG7, BECN1, and ULK1. Moreover, we found that the ability of TRIM5 to stimulate IFN- expression in response to recognition of a TRIM5-restricted HIV-1 capsid mutant (P90A) was abrogated in cells lacking autophagy factors. Stimulation of human macrophage-like cells with the P90A virus protected them against subsequent infection with an otherwise resistant wild type HIV-1 in a manner requiring TRIM5, BECN1, and ULK1. Mechanistically, TRIM5 was attenuated in its ability to activate the kinase TAK1 in autophagy deficient cells, and both BECN1 and ATG7 contributed to the assembly of TRIM5-TAK1 complexes. These data demonstrate a non-canonical role for the autophagy machinery in assembling antiviral signaling complexes and in establishing a TRIM5-dependent antiviral state.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009017;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

All Rights Reserved.The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) Spike glycoprotein is solely responsible for binding to the host cell receptor and facilitating fusion between the viral and host membranes. The ability to generate viral particles pseudotyped with SARS-COV-2 Spike is useful for many types of studies, such as characterization of neutralizing antibodies or development of fusion-inhibiting small molecules. Here, we characterized the use of a codon-optimized SARS-COV-2 Spike glycoprotein for the generation of pseudotyped HIV-1, murine leukemia virus (MLV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles. The full-length Spike protein functioned inefficiently with all three systems but was enhanced over 10-fold by deleting the last 19 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail. Infection of 293FT target cells was possible only if the cells were engineered to stably express the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, but stably introducing an additional copy of this receptor did not further enhance susceptibility. Stable introduction of the Spike-activating protease TMPRSS2 further enhanced susceptibility to infection by 5- to 10-fold. Replacement of the signal peptide of the Spike protein with an optimal signal peptide did not enhance or reduce infectious particle production. However, modifications D614G and R682Q further enhanced infectious particle production. With all enhancing elements combined, the titer of pseudotyped HIV-1 particles reached almost 106 infectious particles/ml. Finally, HIV-1 particles pseudotyped with SARS-COV-2 Spike were successfully used to detect neutralizing antibodies in plasma from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, but not in plasma from uninfected individuals. IMPORTANCE In work with pathogenic viruses, it is useful to have rapid quantitative tests for viral infectivity that can be performed without strict biocontainment restrictions. A common way of accomplishing this is to generate viral pseudoparticles that contain the surface glycoprotein from the pathogenic virus incorporated into a replication-defective viral particle that contains a sensitive reporter system. These pseudoparticles enter cells using the glycoprotein from the pathogenic virus, leading to a readout for infection. Conditions that block entry of the pathogenic virus, such as neutralizing antibodies, will also block entry of the viral pseudoparticles. However, viral glycoproteins often are not readily suited for generating pseudoparticles. Here, we describe a series of modifications that result in the production of relatively high-titer SARS-COV-2 pseudoparticles that are suitable for the detection of neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/21/e01062-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

METHODS: We obtained near full-length HIV-1 genome sequences from people living with HIV (PLWH), including participants on antiretroviral treatment in the Botswana Combination Prevention Project, conducted in 30 Botswana communities in 2013-2018. Phylogenetic relationships among viral sequences were estimated by maximum likelihood. RESULTS: We obtained 6078 near full-length HIV-1C genome sequences from 6075 PLWH. We identified 984 phylogenetically distinct HIV-1 lineages (molecular HIV clusters) circulating in Botswana by mid-2018, with 2-27 members per cluster. Of these, dyads accounted for 62%, approximately 32% (n = 316) were found in single communities, and 68% (n = 668) were spread across multiple communities. Men in clusters were approximately 3 years older than women (median age 42 years, vs 39 years; P < .0001). In 65% of clusters, men were older than women, while in 35% of clusters women were older than men. The majority of identified viral lineages were spread across multiple communities. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of circulating phylogenetically distinct HIV-1C lineages (molecular HIV clusters) suggests highly diversified HIV transmission networks across Botswana communities by 2018.";https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/222/10/1670/5850911;10.4;9.2;9.0;;;;;

For the early-treated cohort (83 HIV-1 adult patients treated within 3 months after infection), HIV-1 diagnosis was not obtained in at least 1 confirmatory assay in 12.0% (10/83) and in an HIV rapid test in 31.3% (26/83). Confirmation assay sensitivities ranged from 87.5% to 95.2%, whereas rapid test assay sensitivities ranged from 75.9% to 100%. The time to treatment initiation or the length of time on treatment did not have a statistical influence on the probability to obtain a false-negative test result. The fastest reversion was demonstrated after 4 months of treatment. Among the long-term treated cohort (390 HIV-1 patients with  9 years of undetectable viral load), false-negative test results were found in at least 1 HIV confirmatory assay for 2.1% (8/390) of the patients and in a HIV rapid test for 4.9% (19/390). Confirmation assay sensitivities ranged from 98.1% to 99.5%, whereas rapid test sensitivities ranged from 96.2% to 100%. Longer treatment increased nonreactivity of the HIV rapid tests (P = .033). Undetectable viral load decreases the sensitivities of HIV diagnostic tests, and further monitoring of the performance of serological assays is advised.;https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/222/10/1660/5841310;10.4;9.2;9.0;;;;;

Here, we compared the abilities of three such germline-targeting immunogens against the VRC01-class receptors to activate the targeted B cells in transgenic mice expressing the germline VH of the VRC01 antibody but diverse mouse light chains. Immunogen-specific VRC01-like B cells were isolated at different time points after immunization, their VH and VL genes were sequenced, and the corresponding antibodies characterized. VRC01 B cell sub-populations with distinct cross-reactivity properties were activated by each immunogen, and these differences correlated with distinct biophysical and biochemical features of the germline-targeting immunogens. Our study indicates that the design of effective immunogens to activate B cell receptors leading to protective HIV-1 antibodies will require a better understanding of how the biophysical properties of the epitope and its surrounding surface on the germline-targeting immunogen influence its interaction with the available receptor variants in vivo. Activating precursor B cell receptors of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies requires specifically designed immunogens. Lin, Parks et al. compare three such germline-targeting immunogens against the VRC01-class receptors and find that each immunogen activates VRC01 B cell sub-populations with distinct cross-reactivity properties and that these differences correlate with distinct biophysical and biochemical features of the germline-targeting immunogens.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1074761320304015;39.0;35.6;37.4;10747613;S1074761320304015;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1074761320304015;;

The clinical latency stage lasts an average of 10 years, until the CD4+ T cell count falls below 200 cells/uL or the patient develops an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection/cancer. This report describes an unusual opportunistic infection in a young patient with no prior clinical evidence of HIV infection. CASE REPORT An 18-year-old man presented with fever, abdominal pain, and dyspnea for the previous 2 weeks and was symptomatically treated for gastroenteritis. He presented 2 weeks later with extreme fatigue, and a CT scan revealed diffuse lymphadenopathy. He was transferred to a regional hospital, but upon arrival and prior to detailed investigative work-up, he developed cardiac arrest. Despite maximal resuscitative efforts, he died approximately 8 h after admission. At autopsy, diffuse lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and pulmonary congestion were noted. Disseminated cryptococcal infection involving almost every organ system was identified at autopsy. A postmortem HIV-1 antibody test was positive. The cause of death was severe immunodeficiency as a result of advanced HIV infection resulting in disseminated cryptococcal infection, with cerebral edema, herniation, and respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS This patient's non-specific symptoms in conjunction with his rapid decline made arriving at a correct diagnosis challenging. Only during autopsy was the disseminated fungal infection discovered, leading to suspicion of HIV infection. HIV autopsies are not uncommon, but the clinical history is usually known beforehand. This case report highlights the importance of considering HIV-related conditions in patients presenting with this array of symptoms, as well as to alert healthcare providers and staff to the need for increased biosafety precautions.;https://www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/924410;1.2;1.1;1.0;;;;;

In this study, 67 thieno[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives were selected as novel HIV-1 RT inhibitors to combat viral resistance, and were subjected to 3 D-QSAR studies using CoMFA, CoMSIA, and T-CoMFA. In the 3 D-QSAR study, two methods of ligand-based alignment and pharmacophore-based alignment were used. The results showed that CoMFA (n = 8; q2 = 0.594; r2 = 0.974) and CoMSIA (n = 7; q2 = 0.528; r2 = 0.965) have good stability and predictability. The molecular docking study showed that the hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions of key residues such as Leu100, Lys101, Val106, Phe227 and Pro236 play an important role in ligand-receptor binding. Based on these results, 12 new thieno[3,4-d]pyrimidines were designed and their activities were predicted; the results indicated that these compounds have good predictive activity and reasonably good ADME/T profiles. MD simulation analysis of 50 ns showed that compound 23j formed four hydrogen bonds with the residues (Lys101, Lys104, Val106 and Thr318), and binds more closely to HIV-1 RT than compound 23j. Furthermore, the group at the R1 position and the horseshoe-like conformation of these compounds are critical for the inhibitory activity and stability. These results provide useful insights for the discovery and design of a new generation of HIV-1 RT inhibitors. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

All Rights Reserved.HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein gp160 exists as a trimer of heterodimers on the viral surface. In most structures of the soluble ectodomain of trimeric HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, the regions from 512 to 517 of the fusion peptide and from 547 to 568 of the N-heptad repeat are disordered. We used aspartate scanning mutagenesis of subtype B strain JRFL Env as an alternate method to probe residue burial in the context of cleaved, cell surface-expressed Env, as buried residues should be intolerant to substitution with Asp. The data are inconsistent with a fully disordered 547 to 568 stretch, as residues 548, 549, 550, 555, 556, 559, 562, and 566 to 569 are all sensitive to Asp substitution. In the fusion peptide region, residues 513 and 515 were also sensitive to Asp substitution, suggesting that the fusion peptide may not be fully exposed in native Env. gp41 is metastable in the context of native trimer. Introduction of Asp at residues that are exposed in the prefusion state but buried in the postfusion state is expected to destabilize the postfusion state and any intermediate states where the residue is buried. We therefore performed soluble CD4 (sCD4)-induced gp120 shedding experiments to identify Asp mutants at residues 551, 554 to 559, 561 to 567, and 569 that could prevent gp120 shedding. We also observed similar mutational effects on shedding for equivalent mutants in the context of clade C Env from isolate 4-2J.41. These substitutions can potentially be used to stabilize native-like trimer derivatives that are used as HIV-1 vaccine immunogens. IMPORTANCE In most crystal structures of the soluble ectodomain of the HIV-1 Env trimer, some residues in the fusion and N-heptad repeat regions are disordered. Whether this is true in the context of native, functional Env on the virion surface is not known. This knowledge may be useful for stabilizing Env in its prefusion conformation and will also help to improve understanding of the viral entry process. Burial of the charged residue Asp in a protein structure is highly destabilizing. We therefore used Asp scanning mutagenesis to probe the burial of apparently disordered residues in native Env and to examine the effect of mutations in these regions on Env stability and conformation as probed by antibody binding to cell surface-expressed Env, CD4-induced shedding of HIV-1 gp120, and viral infectivity studies. Mutations that prevent shedding can potentially be used to stabilize native-like Env constructs for use as vaccine immunogens.;https://jvi.asm.org/content/94/21/e01426-20;9.0;8.4;7.9;0022538X;;;;

However, the role of fitness cost in the evolution of drug resistance has often been overlooked in clinical studies or in vitro selection experiments, as these observations only capture the outcome of drug selection. In this study, we systematically profile the fitness landscape of resistance-associated sites in HIV-1 protease using deep mutational scanning. We construct a mutant library covering combinations of mutations at 11 sites in HIV-1 protease, all of which are associated with resistance to protease inhibitors in clinic. Using deep sequencing, we quantify the fitness of thousands of HIV-1 protease mutants after multiple cycles of replication in human T cells. Although the majority of resistance-associated mutations have deleterious effects on viral replication, we find that epistasis among resistance-associated mutations is predominantly positive. Furthermore, our fitness data are consistent with genetic interactions inferred directly from HIV sequence data of patients. Fitness valleys formed by strong positive epistasis reduce the likelihood of reversal of drug resistance mutations. Overall, our results support the view that strong compensatory effects are involved in the emergence of clinically observed resistance mutations and provide insights to understanding fitness barriers in the evolution and reversion of drug resistance.;https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1009009;11.1;9.7;9.0;15537390;;;;

For retroviruses as well as other viruses, this step is a highly organized process that occurs with exquisite spatial and temporal specificity on the cellular plasma membrane. To facilitate this process, retroviruses encode short peptide motifs, or L domains, that hijack host factors to ensure completion of this critical step. One such cellular machinery targeted by viruses is known as the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRTs). Typically responsible for vesicular trafficking within the cell, ESCRTs are co-opted by the retroviral Gag polyprotein to assist in viral particle assembly and release of infectious virions. This review in the Viruses Special Issue “The 11th International Retroviral Nucleocapsid and Assembly Symposium”, details recent findings that shed light on the molecular details of how ESCRTs and the ESCRT adaptor protein ALIX, facilitate retroviral dissemination at sites of viral assembly.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/10/1188;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

The analysis focused on 1751 (28.4%) and 2575 (41.8%) sequences of subtype A1 and B, respectively. Identification of MTCs was based on phylogenetic analysis. The analyses identified 38 MTCs including 2–1518 subtype A1 sequences and 168 MTCs in the range of 2–218 subtype B sequences. The proportion of sequences within MTCs was 93.8% (1642/1751) and 77.0% (1982/2575) for subtype A1 and B, respectively. Transmissions within MTCs for subtype A1 were associated with risk group (Men having Sex with Men vs. heterosexuals, OR = 5.34, p < 0.001) and Greek origin (Greek vs. non-Greek origin, OR = 6.05, p < 0.001) and for subtype B, they were associated with Greek origin (Greek vs. non-Greek origin, OR = 1.57, p = 0.019), younger age (OR = 0.96, p < 0.001), and more recent sampling (time period: 2011–2015 vs. 1999–2005, OR = 3.83, p < 0.001). Our findings about the patterns of across and within country dispersal as well as the parameters associated with transmission within MTCs provide a framework for the application of the study of molecular clusters for HIV prevention.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/10/1183;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

They are advantageous over monotherapies due to better efficacy, reduced toxicity, as well as the ability to prevent the development of resistant viral strains and to treat viral co-infections. Here, we identify new synergistic combinations against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), echovirus 1 (EV1), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) in vitro. We observed synergistic activity of nelfinavir with convalescent serum and with purified neutralizing antibody 23G7 against SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells. We also demonstrated synergistic activity of nelfinavir with EIDD-2801 or remdesivir in Calu-3 cells. In addition, we showed synergistic activity of vemurafenib with emetine, homoharringtonine, anisomycin, or cycloheximide against EV1 infection in human lung epithelial A549 cells. We also found that combinations of sofosbuvir with brequinar or niclosamide are synergistic against HCV infection in hepatocyte-derived Huh-7.5 cells, and that combinations of monensin with lamivudine or tenofovir are synergistic against HIV-1 infection in human cervical TZM-bl cells. These results indicate that synergy is achieved when a virus-directed antiviral is combined with another virus- or host-directed agent. Finally, we present an online resource that summarizes novel and known antiviral drug combinations and their developmental status.;https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/10/1178;5.8;5.3;4.3;;;;;

Quantitative differences in IFNAR binding correlate with antiviral activity, but whether IFN-Is exhibit qualitative differences remains controversial. Moreover, the IFN-I response is protective during acute HIV-1 infection, but likely pathogenic during the chronic stages. To gain a deeper understanding of the IFN-I response, we compared the interferomes of IFN subtypes dominantly-expressed in HIV-1-exposed plasmacytoid dendritic cells (1, 2, 5, 8 and 14) and IFN in the earliest cellular targets of HIV-1 infection. Primary gut CD4 T cells from 3 donors were treated for 18 hours ex vivo with individual IFN-Is normalized for IFNAR signaling strength. Of 1,969 IFNregulated genes, 246 'core ISGs' were induced by all IFN-Is tested. However, many IFNregulated genes were not shared between the IFN subtypes despite similar induction of canonical antiviral ISGs such as ISG15, RSAD2 and MX1, formally demonstrating qualitative differences between the IFN subtypes. Notably, IFN induced a broader interferome than the individual IFN subtypes. Since IFN, and not IFN, is upregulated during chronic HIV-1 infection in the gut, we compared core ISGs and IFN-specific ISGs from colon pinch biopsies of HIV-1-uninfected (n = 13) versus age- and gender-matched, antiretroviral-therapy naive persons with HIV-1 (PWH; n = 19). Core ISGs linked to inflammation, T cell activation and immune exhaustion were elevated in PWH, positively correlated with plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels and gut IFN levels, and negatively correlated with gut CD4 T cell frequencies. In sharp contrast, IFN-specific ISGs linked to protein translation and anti-inflammatory responses were significantly downregulated in PWH, negatively.";https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008986;11.5;11.1;11.0;15537366;;;;

We found that GS-6207 inhibits HIV-1 by stabilizing and thereby preventing functional disassembly of the capsid shell in infected cells. X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments revealed that GS-6207 tightly binds two adjoining capsid subunits and promotes distal intra- and inter-hexamer interactions that stabilize the curved capsid lattice. In addition, GS-6207 interferes with capsid binding to the cellular HIV-1 cofactors Nup153 and CPSF6 that mediate viral nuclear import and direct integration into gene-rich regions of chromatin. These findings elucidate structural insights into the multimodal, potent antiviral activity of GS-6207 and provide a means for rationally developing second-generation therapies.";None;49.4;47.1;45.3;;;;;

We aimed to measure alterations in microbial translocation, monocyte activation, gut immune recovery, and intestinal epithelial cell damage in HAART treated individuals. Methods: A prospective, single-arm, longitudinal, cohort study was conducted among antiretroviral naïve HIV-1 infected Thai participants. All participants were in chronic stage of HIV-1 infection before starting HAART. Data and samples were collected prior to initiation of HAART and then after 24 and 48 weeks of HAART. Plasma biomarkers for microbial translocation (16S rDNA and LBP), monocyte activation (sCD14) and intestinal epithelial cell damage (I-FABP) were evaluated. We measured circulating gut-homing CD4+ T cells and circulating gut-homing Th17 cells to assess recoveries of gut immunity and gut immunity to microbial pathogens. Results: The kinetic studies showed no reduction in the levels of plasma 16S rDNA, sCD14 or I-FABP, significant decrease of plasma LBP level, and slow but significant increases in the frequencies of circulating gut-homing CD4+ T cells and circulating gut-homing Th17 cells during 48 weeks of HAART. Dividing participants into low and high microbial translocation (low and high MT) groups at baseline, both groups showed persistent plasma levels of 16S rDNA, sCD14 and I-FABP, and significantly decreased plasma level of LBP. The low MT group had significantly increased frequencies of circulating gut-homing CD4+ T cells and circulating gut-homing Th17 cells during 48 weeks of HAART but this was not observed in the high MT group. Conclusions: We demonstrated persistent high microbial translocation, monocyte activation and intestinal epithelial cell damage with slow gut immune recovery during successful short-term HAART. Additionally, gut immune recovery was apparently limited by high microbial translocation. Our findings emphasize the adverse impact of high microbial translocation on gut immune recovery and the necessity of establishing a novel therapeutic intervention to inhibit microbial translocation.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1043466620302738;5.8;6.1;5.0;10434666;S1043466620302738;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1043466620302738;;

Herein, longitudinal echocardiography was used to assess whether NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice reconstituted with human hematopoietic stem cells (Hu-NSG mice) and infected with HIV-1ADA can recapitulate the salient features of this progressive human disease. Four weeks post infection, Hu-NSG mice of both sexes developed left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (DD), with 25% exhibiting grade III/IV restrictive DD with mitral regurgitation. Increases in global longitudinal and circumferential strains and declines in LV ejection fraction and fractional shortening were observed eight weeks post infection. After twelve weeks of infection, 33% of Hu-NSG mice exhibited LV dyskinesia and dyssynchrony. Histopathological analyses of hearts seventeen weeks post infection revealed coronary microvascular leakage, fibrosis and immune cell infiltration into the myocardium. These data show for the first time that HIV-1ADA-infected Hu-NSG mice can recapitulate key left ventricular cardiac deficits and pathophysiological changes reported in humans with progressive HIV-1 infection. The results also suggest that HIV-1 infected Hu-NSG mice may be a useful model to screen for pharmacological agents to blunt LV dysfunction and associated pathophysiologic causes reported in PLWH.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65943-9;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 170 adults with HIV-1/TB co-infection. Cases had at least one viral load (VL) 1000 RNA copies/mL after 6 months on NNRTI-based ART, and controls had sustained VLs <1000 copies/mL. We sequenced plasma viruses by Sanger and MiSeq next-generation sequencing (NGS). We assessed drug resistance mutations (DRMs) using the Stanford drug resistance database, and analysed NGS data for DRMs at 20%, 10%, 5% and 2% thresholds. We assessed the effect of pretreatment drug resistance (PDR) on VF. RESULTS: We analysed sequences from 45 cases and 125 controls. Overall prevalence of PDR detected at a 20% threshold was 4.7% (8/170) and was higher in cases than in controls (8.9% versus 3.2%), P = 0.210. Participants with PDR at 20% had almost 4-fold higher odds of VF (adjusted OR 3.7, 95% CI 0.8-18.3) compared with those without, P = 0.104. PDR prevalence increased to 18.2% (31/170) when LA-DRVs at 2% were included. Participants with pretreatment LA-DRVs only had 1.6-fold higher odds of VF (adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.6-4.3) compared with those without, P = 0.398. CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment DRMs and LA-DRVs increased the odds of developing VF on NNRTI-based ART, although without statistical significance. NGS increased detection of DRMs but provided no additional benefit in identifying participants at risk of VF at lower thresholds. More studies assessing mutation thresholds predictive of VF are required to inform use of NGS in treatment decisions.;https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/75/11/3319/5890037;8.7;7.7;8.3;;;;;

Few reports exist on patients with HIV and OMA. CASE REPORT: A 41-year-old man diagnosed with HIV-1 infection in 1997 coursed with multiple anti-retroviral schemes as a consequence of poor adherence. In 2008 he presented an HIV-1 viral load of 100,000 copies/mL and a CD4+ T cell count of 10 cells/mm3. In 2013 our patient arrived with an 11-month history of progressive opsoclonus and ataxia. He had undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA load and CD4+ of 606 cells/mm3. No opportunistic infections were found. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed mildly elevated protein concentration and HIV-1 viral load of 534 copies/mL. Cerebrospinal fluid co-receptor tropism test showed selective CCR5 usage. A brain magnetic resonance imaging showed hippocampal atrophy and T2-weighted hyperintensities. Our patient exhibited a dramatic recovery and cerebrospinal fluid HIV clearance after adjustment of anti-retroviral treatment based on genotyping resistance and tropism analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HIV presenting cengral nervous system dysfunction without opportunistic infections, cerebro-spinal fluid and plasma HIV-1 viral load, resistance and tropism tests should be performed to assess a potential viral escape and to design the appropriate anti-retroviral therapy in an individual patient basis.TITLE: Síndrome opsoclono-mioclono-ataxia asociado a fenómeno de escape viral por virus de la inmunodeficiencia humana en el sistema nervioso central.

En 2013 sufrió un cuadro progresivo de 11 meses de evolución caracterizado por opsoclonía y ataxia. En ese momento, su carga viral era indetectable, y la cuenta de CD4+, de 606 células/mm3. Se descartaron infecciones oportunistas. El examen del líquido cefalorraquídeo demostró hiperproteinorraquia leve y una carga viral de 534 copias/mL. El examen del tropismo de correceptor en el líquido cefalorraquídeo demostró un uso selectivo de CCR5. La resonancia magnética cerebral objetivó atrofia hipocámpica e hiperintensidades en las secuencias ponderadas en T2. El paciente mostró una recuperación clínica franca y un aclaramiento de la carga viral en el líquido cefalorraquídeo tras el ajuste de antirretrovirales basado en la resistencia de genotipo y el análisis de tropismo. Conclusiones. En pacientes con infección por el VIH y disfunción del sistema nervioso central sin infecciones oportunistas, debería llevarse a cabo una determinación de la carga viral en el plasma y el líquido cefalorraquídeo para descartar un potencial fenómeno de escape viral, así como exámenes de resistencia y tropismo para diseñar el tratamiento antirretroviral adecuado.;https://www.neurologia.com/articulo/2020243;1.1;1.0;1.0;;;;;

The current study examined syndemic burden and health outcomes among women living with HIV. METHODS: Women were participants enrolled in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Outcomes included blood pressure, HIV health status (HIV-1 RNA viral load and CD4 T-cell counts), and IL-6. Syndemic burden was defined as a count variable of low education, obesity, cigarette use, and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Women (N = 131) were an average of 60.54 years of age (SD = 8.86), and 49% were non-Hispanic Black. In multivariable analyses, syndemic burden was not significantly associated with SBP (P = 0.342) or DBP (P = 0.763), IL-6 (P = 0.168), or CD4 cell count (P = 0.846). However, syndemic burden was associated with increased viral load (age adjusted  = 0.35, P < 0.001). Comparing women with high versus low syndemic burden, also controlling for women's age, women with high syndemic burden had higher DBP and HIV viral load. DISCUSSION: Syndemic burden appeared to play an important role in HIV health status and could potentially increase the risk of HIV transmission. High syndemic burden, defined as at least two syndemic conditions, had the greatest effects of HIV viral load and DBP. Targeted interventions to address syndemic burden may help improve health outcomes in women living with HIV as well as reduce the risk of hypertension and HIV transmission.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAD.0000000000002617;8.8;7.1;7.5;;;;;

Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), non-NRTI, and protease inhibitor resistance (-R) was allowed, but integrase strand transfer inhibitor-R was excluded. Here, we describe the detailed resistance analysis. METHODS: Historical plasma HIV-1 RNA genotypes and baseline proviral DNA genotypes were analyzed. Documented or investigator-suspected NRTI-R was grouped for stratification into 3 categories of level of resistance. Viral blips were assessed through week 48. Virologic failures had genotypic and phenotypic resistance analyses at week 48, confirmed failure, or last visit, if HIV-1 RNA did not resuppress to <50 copies/mL while on study drug. RESULTS: In total, 83% (470/565) of participants had baseline genotypic data available with NRTI-R detected in 24% (138/565), including 5% (30/565) with K65R/E/N or 3 thymidine analog mutations and 19% (108/565) with other NRTI-R mutations. M184V/I was present in 14% (81/565). Pre-existing integrase strand transfer inhibitor-R mutations were found in 4% (20/565) of participants. Primary non-NRTI-R and protease inhibitor-R mutations were present in 21% (118/565) and 7% (38/565) of participants. High rates of viral suppression were maintained in all groups through week 48; blips were observed in only 15 participants (2.7%). Three participants met criteria for resistance analysis (all in DTG+F/TAF arm); none developed treatment-emergent resistance to study drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with baseline NRTI resistance, much of which was previously undocumented, maintained suppression 48 weeks after switching to B/F/TAF or DTG+F/TAF triple therapy. Blips and virologic failure were uncommon using either regimen, with no treatment-emergent resistance.";https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAI.0000000000002454;6.9;7.0;6.4;;;;;

Similarly, a small number of macaques infected with SHIVs develop broadly neutralizing serologic activity, but less is known about the nature of simian antibodies. Here, we report on a monoclonal antibody, Ab1485, isolated from a macaque infected with SHIVAD8 that developed broadly neutralizing serologic activity targeting the V3-glycan region of HIV-1 Env. Ab1485 neutralizes 38.1% of HIV-1 isolates in a 42-pseudovirus panel with a geometric mean IC50 of 0.055 µg/mLl and SHIVAD8 with an IC50 of 0.028 µg/mLl. Ab1485 binds the V3-glycan epitope in a glycan-dependent manner. A 3.5 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of Ab1485 in complex with a native-like SOSIP Env trimer showed conserved contacts with the N332gp120 glycan and gp120 GDIR peptide motif, but in a distinct Env-binding orientation relative to human V3/N332gp120 glycan-targeting bNAbs. Intravenous infusion of Ab1485 protected macaques from a high dose challenge with SHIVAD8. We conclude that macaques can develop bNAbs against the V3-glycan patch that resemble human V3-glycan bNAbs.;https://elifesciences.org/articles/61991;10.0;10.8;10.8;;;;;

The phylodynamic and virological differences among CRF07_BC clusters circulating in MSM, and the factors that could be driving their evolution, remains unclear. Using the HIV-1 CRF07_BC strains obtained from the Los Alamos HIV database, we undertook a large-scale phylogenetic analysis using the maximum likelihood method of partial gag, pol, and env segments to infer their evolutionary relationships. The demographic histories of clusters were determined using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. For four pol clusters we analyzed the non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitution rates and performed site to site analysis to identify positive selection sites and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutation positions. MSM was found to be the predominant risk factor for all four of the CRF07_BC epidemic pol segment clusters with the largest number of infections. Two of those clusters had higher growth in the effective number of infections, and two clusters had slower growth. Analysis of all four clusters showed no significant differences in the mean substitution rates and dN/dS selection pressure ratios. However, a site to site codon analysis found thirteen significant positive selection sites. Ten of these sites are CTL escape mutations. The two clusters with the higher growth in infections had seven and eight pol segment CTL escape mutation sites respectively, while the two with slower growth had only one or two. Our findings demonstrated differences in the CTL escape mutation and divergent evolution of several CRF07_BC clusters circulating among men who have sex with men in China.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567134820303178;5.2;4.9;5.0;15671348;S1567134820303178;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1567134820303178;;

We previously reported superior efficacy of fostemsavir versus placebo in the randomised cohort of the BRIGHTE study after 8-day functional monotherapy (primary endpoint); here we report planned interim analyses through week 96. Methods: BRIGHTE (NCT02362503) is an ongoing multicentre, two-cohort, phase 3 trial, done at 108 centres in 22 countries. We enrolled heavily treatment-experienced adults (18 years) failing antiretroviral therapy (HIV-1 RNA 400 copies per mL) into two cohorts: the randomised cohort, in which patients with one or two fully active antiretrovirals remaining received oral fostemsavir (600 mg twice a day) or placebo in combination with their failing regimen for 8 days, followed by fostemsavir plus optimised background therapy; or the non-randomised cohort, in which patients with no remaining antiretroviral options received oral fostemsavir (600 mg twice a day) plus optimised background therapy from day 1. Endpoints for the week 96 interim analyses included the proportions of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA of less than 40 copies per mL, changes from baseline in CD4 cell counts, and the frequency of adverse events, adverse events leading to discontinuation, and deaths. The intention-to-treat exposed population and the safety population both included all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. The response rates (proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA <40 copies per mL) in the intention-to-treat exposed population were calculated via snapshot analysis at weeks 24, 48, and 96. Findings: Between Feb 23, 2015, and Aug 11, 2016, 371 participants were enrolled and treated, of which 272 participants were in the randomised cohort and 99 in the non-randomised cohort. 320 (86%) of 371 reported a history of AIDS. In the randomised cohort, rates of virological suppression (HIV-1 RNA <40 copies per mL) increased from 53% (144 of 272) at week 24 to 60% (163 of 272) at week 96. Response rates in the non-randomised cohort were 37% (37 of 99) at week 24 and week 96. Mean increases in CD4 counts from baseline at week 96 were 205 cells per L (SD 191) in the randomised cohort and 119 cells per L (202) in the non-randomised cohort. Mean CD4/CD8 ratio increased from 0·20 at baseline to 0·44 at week 96 in the randomised cohort. Few adverse events led to discontinuation (26 [7%] of 371). 12 (4%) of 272 people in the randomised cohort and 17 (17%) of 99 in the non-randomised cohort died; the median baseline CD4 count for participants who died was 11 cells per L. Interpretation: In heavily treatment-experienced individuals with advanced HIV-1 disease and limited treatment options, fostemsavir-based antiretroviral regimens were generally well tolerated and showed a distinctive trend of increasing virological and immunological response rates through 96 weeks; these findings support fostemsavir as a treatment option for this vulnerable population.

DAVEIs trigger virolysis of HIV-1 virions through interactions with the trimeric envelope glycoprotein complex (Env), though the details of these interactions are not fully determined as yet. The purpose of this work was to use structural modeling to rationalize a dependence of DAVEI potency on the molecular length of the linker connecting the two components. We used temperature accelerated molecular dynamics and on-the-fly parameterization to compute free energy versus end-to-end distance for two different linker lengths, DAVEI L0 (His6) and DAVEI L2 ([Gly4Ser]2His6). Additionally, an envelope model was created based on a cryo-electron microscopy-derived structure of a cleaved, soluble Env construct, with high-mannose glycans added which served as putative docking locations for the lectin, along with MPER added that served as a putative docking location for the MPER region of DAVEI (MPERDAVEI). Using MD simulation, distances between the lectin C-terminus and Env gp41 MPER were measured. We determined that none of the glycans were close enough to gp41 MPER to allow DAVEI L0 to function, while one, N448, will allow DAVEI L2 to function. These findings are consistent with the previously determined dependence of lytic function on DAVEI linker lengths. This supports the hypothesis that DAVEI's engage Env at both glycans and the Env MPER in causing membrane poration and lysis.;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pro.3949;4.6;4.6;5.4;09618368;;;;

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: HIV treatment guidelines have traditionally recommended that all HIV-positive individuals are tested for evidence of drug resistance prior to starting ART. Testing for resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors and PIs is well established in routine care. However, testing for integrase strand transfer inhibitor (InSTI) resistance is less consistent. OBJECTIVES: To inform treatment guidelines by determining the prevalence of InSTI resistance in a national cohort of recently infected individuals. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Recent (within 4 months) HIV-1 infections were identified using a Recent Infection Testing Algorithm of new HIV-1 diagnoses in the UK. Resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) in integrase, protease and reverse transcriptase were detected by ultradeep sequencing, which allows for the sensitive estimation of the frequency of each resistant variant in a sample. RESULTS: The analysis included 655 randomly selected individuals (median age = 33 years, 95% male, 83% MSM, 78% white) sampled in the period 2014 to 2016 and determined to have a recent infection. These comprised 320, 138 and 197 samples from 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. None of the samples had major InSTI RAMs occurring at high variant frequency (20%). A subset (25/640, 3.9%) had major InSTI RAMs occurring only as low-frequency variants (2%-20%). In contrast, 47/588 (8.0%) had major reverse transcriptase inhibitor and PI RAMs at high frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Between 2014 and 2016, major InSTI RAMs were uncommon in adults with recent HIV-1 infection, only occurring as low-frequency variants of doubtful clinical significance.

In a case-control study, we evaluated the influence of the nutritional and antioxidant status in HIV-1 adults whose cART was initiated between January 2001 and December 2013. Cases had persistent CD4 counts < 350/L vs. > 350/L for controls, after at least 2 years of cART with persistent viral loads (VL) < 50 copies/mL. Twelve cases and twenty-eight control subjects with the same CD4 count at cART initiation were compared for their nutritional and antioxidant status after age adjustment at dosage assessment. Patients were predominantly male (70%), Caucasian (82%) and at AIDS stage (62%). The median age was 53, and the median CD4 count was 245/mm3 for cases and 630/mm3 for controls after a median time of 7 years on cART. Despite higher energy intakes in cases, anthropometric data was comparable between groups who had similar vitamins B9/B12/C/D/E, zinc, citrulline and glutamine levels. Nine cases (75%) and 8 controls (29%) had hypervitaminosis A (> 2.70 mol/L) (p = 0.030). Cases had lower erythrocyte resistance when exposed to a controlled free radical attack (p = 0.014). Most cases had hypervitaminosis A and altered antioxidant capacities that could affect immunological response. Wide-scale studies are required, but in the meantime, screening of their vitamin A status must be encouraged in these patients.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10096-020-03954-0;5.2;4.5;4.6;09349723;;;;

Co-administration of TAF with rifabutin (RFB) is not recommended due to concerns that RFB decreases TAF gastrointestinal absorption. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy regimens that include the co-administration of TAF and RFB. Methods: Persons with HIV (PWH) who received TAF–RFB co-administration for 1 month were identified retrospectively. The primary outcome was the maintenance of HIV viral load <200 copies/mL (cpm) for those already on HIV therapy at RFB initiation, or suppression of viral load to <200 cpm for those with unsuppressed HIV viral load prior to TAF–RFB co-administration. Results: Twenty-two PWH met the inclusion criteria. Four out of five patients (80%) maintained a viral load <200 cpm and 15/17 (88%) achieved a viral load <200 cpm during TAF–RFB co-administration. After the exclusion of patients who self-discontinued therapy or were lost to follow-up, 19/19 (100%) met the combined primary endpoint of HIV viral load <200 cpm. Conclusions: This study suggests that TAF–RFB co-administration may be effective despite concerns that RFB could reduce TAF absorption.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1201971220321391;5.3;5.6;5.3;12019712;S1201971220321391;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1201971220321391;;

To date, human brain pharmacokinetic data are solely derived from lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and mostly originate from single samples. DESIGN: We determined concentrations of antiretroviral drugs in serial samples of ventricular CSF and compared these to the concentrations in serum and lumbar CSF of these patients. METHODS: Two treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected patients received external ventricular drainage for obstructive hydrocephalus. Starting with a combination antiretroviral regimen (cART), ventricular CSF, and subsequently lumbar CSF, with parallel serum, was frequently collected. Drug concentrations were determined and CSF-to-serum ratios were calculated. RESULTS: High concentrations, resulting in high CSF-to-serum ratios, were found in the ventricular CSF of the three substances zidovudine, lamivudine and indinavir, whereas this was not observed for stavudine, ritonavir, saquinavir and efavirenz. Concentrations of zidovudine and lamivudine were up to four times greater in CSF from the ventricles than in lumbar CSF of the same patient. The zidovudine concentrations in the ventricular CSF exceeded serum concentrations by a factor of 1.4. CONCLUSION: Unexpectedly high concentrations of some antiretrovirals in the ventricular CSF, the site close to the brain parenchyma where HIV is located, should be considered when the cART regimen is aiming at CNS viral replication.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/QAD.0000000000002626;8.8;7.1;7.5;;;;;

Methods: We quantified the HIV-1 proviral DNA and 2-long terminal repeat (2-LTR) circle loads from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the levels of CD38+ and Ki-67+ T-cells, and the levels of interleukin 7 (IL-7) in a cohort of patients with more than 5 years of ART at enrollment and after 1 year. Results: Among 29 participants with a median of 8 years (inter-quartile range, 6.9–9.4) under suppressive ART, we found higher levels of CD8+ CD38+ T-cells after 1 year (P =.000). We determined weak and statistically non-significant correlations between the levels of immune activation and the proviral DNA loads in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Ki-67+ T-cells declined but not significantly and there was no significant correlation with the proportion of CD38+. Plasmatic IL-7 did not consistently correlated with the CD38+ and Ki-67+ T-cells. Conclusions: We found weak but statistically non-significant correlations between the levels of T-cell activation and the proviral DNA and 2-LTR circle loads. These results suggest that mechanisms other than viral replication drive chronic versus early immune activation in the long term.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1201971220306731;5.3;5.6;5.3;12019712;S1201971220306731;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1201971220306731;;

MA is myristoylated and possess a highly basic region (HBR) responsible for the interaction with the negative lipids of the PM, especially with PIP2. In addition, MA binds RNA molecules proposed as a regulatory step of the assembly process. Here we study the interaction of a synthetic peptide (N-terminal 21 amino acids of MA) and liposomes of different compositions using a variety of biophysical techniques. Particularly, we use the fluorescence properties of the single tryptophan of the peptide to analyze its partition to membranes, where we harness for first time the analytical ability of spectral phasors method to study this interaction. We found that electrostatic interactions play an important role for peptide partition to membranes and myristoylation reduces the free energy of the process. Interestingly, we observe that while the presence of PIP2 does not cause measurable changes on the peptide-membrane interaction, the interaction is favored by cholesterol. Additionally, we found that the partition process goes through a transition state involving peptide disaggregation and changes in the peptide secondary structure. On the other hand, we found that the presence of oligonucleotides competes with the interaction with lipids by increasing peptide solubility. In summary, we think that our results, in context of the current knowledge of the role of HIV-1 MA, contribute to a better molecular understanding of the membrane association process.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0005273620302649;7.5;7.2;7.8;00052736;S0005273620302649;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0005273620302649;;

People living with HIV/AIDS have substance abuse disorders at higher rates than non-infected individuals, which puts them at an increased risk of drug–drug interactions. Areas covered: Potential drug–drug interactions are reviewed for a variety of potential drugs of abuse, both licit and illicit. These drugs include alcohol, cigarettes or other nicotine delivery systems, methamphetamine, cocaine, opioids, and marijuana. Potential interactions include decreased adherence, modulation of drug transporters, or modulation of metabolic enzymes. We also review the relative incidence of the use of these drugs of abuse in People living with HIV/AIDS. Expert opinion: Despite considerable improvements in outcomes, disparities in outcomes between PLWHA who use drugs of abuse, vs those who do not still exist. It is of critical necessity to improve outcomes in these patients and to work with them to stop abusing drugs of abuse.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17425255.2020.1814737;5.7;5.9;6.4;17425255;;;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.HIV noninfectious comorbidities (NICMs) are a current healthcare challenge. The situation is further complicated as there are very few effective models that can be used for NICM research. Previous research has supported the use of the HIV-1 transgenic rat (HIV-1TGR) as a model for the study of HIV/AIDS. However, additional studies are needed to confirm whether this model has features that would support NICM research. A demonstration of the utility of the HIV-1TGR model would be to show that the HIV-1TGR has cellular receptors able to bind HIV proteins, as this would be relevant for the study of cell-specific tissue pathology. In fact, an increased frequency of HIV receptors on a specific cell type may increase tissue vulnerability since binding to HIV proteins would eventually result in cell dysfunction and death. Evidence suggests that observations of selective cellular vulnerability in this model are consistent with some specific tissue vulnerabilities seen in NICMs. We identified CXCR4-expressing cells in the brain, while specific markers for neuronal degeneration demonstrated that the same neural types were dying. We also confirm the presence of gp120 and Tat by immunocytochemistry in the spleen, as previously reported. However, we observed very rare positive cells in the brain. This underscores the point that gp120, which has been reported as detected in the sera and CSF, is a likely source to which these CXCR4-positive cells are exposed. This alternative appears more probable than the local production of gp120. Further studies may indicate some level of local production, but that will not eliminate the role of receptor-mediated pathology. The binding of gp120 to the CXCR4 receptor on neurons and other neural cell types in the HIV-1TGR can thus explain the phenomena of selective cell death. Selective cellular vulnerability may be a contributing factor to the development of NICMs. Our data indicate that the HIV-1TGR can be an effective model for the studies of HIV NICMs because of the difference in the regional expression of CXCR4 in rat tissues, thus leading to specific organ pathology. This also suggests that the model can be used in the development of therapeutic options.;https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/8/11/1643;0;0;0.5;;;;;

An increasing number of distinct HIV-1 recombinants have been identified worldwide, but their contribution to the global epidemic is unknown. We aimed to estimate the global and regional distribution of HIV-1 recombinant forms during 1990–2015. Methods: We assembled a global HIV-1 molecular epidemiology database through a systematic literature review and a global survey. We searched the PubMed, Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (Ebscohost), and Global Health (Ovid) databases for HIV-1 subtyping studies published from Jan 1, 1990, to Dec 31, 2015. Unpublished original HIV-1 subtyping data were collected through a survey among experts in the field who were members of the WHO–UNAIDS Network for HIV Isolation and Characterisation. We included prevalence studies with HIV-1 subtyping data collected during 1990–2015. Countries were grouped into 14 regions and analyses were done for four time periods (1990–99, 2000–04, 2005–09, and 2010–15). The distribution of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs) in individual countries was weighted according to the UNAIDS estimates of the number of people living with HIV in each country to generate regional and global estimates of numbers and proportions of HIV-1 recombinants in each time period. The systematic review is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42017067164. Findings: Our global data collection yielded an HIV-1 molecular epidemiology database of 383 519 samples from 116 countries in 1990–2015. We found that the proportion of recombinants increased over time, both globally and in most regions, reaching 22·8% (7 978 517 of 34 921 639) of global HIV-1 infections in 2010–15. Both the proportion and the number of distinct CRFs detected increased over time to 16·7% and 57 CRFs in 2010–15. The global and regional distribution of HIV-1 recombinants was diverse and evolved over time, and we found large regional variation in the numbers (0–44 CRFs), types (58 distinct CRFs), and proportions (0–80·5%) of HIV-1 recombinants. Globally, CRF02_AG was the most prevalent recombinant, accounting for 33·9% (2 701 364 of 7 978 517) of all recombinant infections in 2010–15. URFs accounted for 26·7% (2 131 450 of 7 978 517), CRF01_AE for 23·0% (1 838 433), and other CRFs for 16·4% (1 307 270) of all recombinant infections in 2010–15. Although other CRFs accounted for small proportions of infections globally (<1% each), they were prominent in regional epidemics, including in east and southeast Asia, west and central Africa, Middle East and north Africa, and eastern Europe and central Asia. In addition, in 2010–15, central Africa (21·3% [243 041 of 1 143 531]), west Africa (15·5% [838 476 of 5 419 010]), east Africa (12·6% [591 140 of 4 704 986]), and Latin America (9·6% [153 069 of 1 586 605]) had high proportions of URFs. Interpretation: HIV-1 recombinants are increasingly prominent in global and regional HIV epidemics, which has important implications for the development of an HIV vaccine and the design of diagnostic, resistance, and viral load assays. Continued and improved surveillance of the global molecular epidemiology of HIV is crucial.

In this study, we propose a dynamical fractional order HIV-1 model in Caputo sense which involves the interactions between cancer cells, healthy CD4+T lymphocytes, and virus infected CD4+T lymphocytes leading to chaotic behavior. The model has been investigated for the existence and uniqueness of its solution via fixed point theory, while the unique non-negative solution remains bounded within the biologically feasible region. The stability analysis of the model is performed and the biological relevance of the equilibria is also discussed in the paper. The numerical simulations are obtained under different instances of fractional order . It is observed that, as the fractional power decreases from ’one’ the chaotic behavior becomes more and more attractive.

In this mini-review, I will discuss the situation in Shenzhen city as a window of China to reflect our strategies in fighting the concurrent HIV/AIDS and COVID-19 pandemics. RECENT FINDINGS: Prevention of nosocomial infection, minimizing the follow-up visits to the hospital, maintaining the delivery of PreP/PEP services and testing for SARS-Cov-2 and HIV when someone have fever or respiratory symptoms were the four major approaches to maintain uninterrupted HIV care in Shenzhen. None of 15 000 PLWH seeking HIV care at Shenzhen were diagnosed with COVID-19 during this pandemic. SUMMARY: This article share the experience unprecedented from Shenzhen. We have to adapt our care and service to continue to engage PLWH to avoid poor outcomes. More research is needed to know the long-term implications of pandemic for the health of PLWH.;https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/COH.0000000000000653;7.5;7.2;7.8;;;;;

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of reduced doses of both tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and efavirenz for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. In this open-label, non-inferiority trial, HIV-1-infected antiretroviral-naive adults were randomly assigned to receive either a lower dose anti-retroviral regimen comprised of TDF (200 mg), efavirenz (400 mg), and standard dose lamivudine (300 mg) or the standard dose regimen. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA 50 copies/mL at week 48 using a non-inferiority margin of -10%. At week 48, 79 of 92 (85.9%) participants in the lower dose regimen group and 78 of 92 (84.8%) in the standard dose regimen group achieved HIV-1 RNA 50 copies/mL (treatment difference 1.1%, 95% CI -9.1 to 11.3) in the intention-to-treat analysis. Drug-related adverse events occurred more frequently in the participants receiving the standard dose regimen compared with the lower dose one (63.0% vs 80.4%). Changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate and bone mineral density were comparable between the two groups. The non-inferior efficacy and better safety profile of the lower dose ARV regimen support its use as alternative initial therapy for HIV-1 infected patients.;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2020.1752609;7.3;4.9;6.9;;;;;

There remains a great need to improve the use of existing drugs for HIV therapy. Berberine is traditionally used to treat diarrhea, bacillary dysentery, and gastroenteritis in clinics, here our research shows that berberine is effective in inhibiting HIV-1 entry. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis studies reveal that berberine can directly bind to both N36 and C34 to form a novel N36-berberine-C34 complex and effectively block the six-helix bundle formation between the N-terminal heptad repeat peptide N36 and the C-terminal heptad repeat peptide C34. Circular dichroism experiments show that binding of berberine produces conformational changes that damages the secondary structures of 6-HB. Computer-aided molecular docking studies suggest a hydrogen bond with T-639 and two polar bonds with Q-563 and T-639 are established, involving the oxygen atom and the C=O group of the indole ring. Berberine completely inhibits six HIV-1 clade B isolates and exhibits antiviral activities in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values varying from 5.5 to 10.25 µg/ml. This compound-peptide interaction may represent a mechanism of action of antiviral activities of berberine. As a summary, these studies successfully identify compound berberine as a potential candidate drug for HIV-1 treatment. As a summary, antiviral activity of berberine in combination with its use in clinical practice, this medicine can be used as a potential clinically anti-HIV drug.;https://amb-express.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13568-020-01088-2;2.5;2.8;3.6;;;;;

One-third of these individuals do not achieve optimal CD4 cell recovery (OR) after suppressive antiretroviral treatment (ART). This retrospective/longitudinal study of poor recovery (PR) included 79 HIV-1-infected individuals with CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 (25 PR and 54 OR) before ART. After suppressive ART, 21 PR and 24 OR individuals were further analysed, including paired samples. Selected miRs and plasma inflammatory markers were determined to investigate their potential predictive/diagnostic value for poor recovery. miR-192, IL-6 and sCD14 were independently associated with CD4 recovery before ART (p = 0.031, p = 0.007, and p = 0.008, respectively). The combination of these three factors returned a good discrimination (predictive value for PR) value of 0.841 (AUC, p < 0.001). After suppressive ART, miR-144 was independently associated with CD4 recovery (p = 0.017), showing a moderate discrimination value of 0.730 (AUC, p = 0.008) for PR. Our study provides new evidence on the relationship between miRs and HIV-1 infection that could help improve the management of individuals at HIV-1 diagnosis. These miRs and cytokines signature sets provide novel tools to predict CD4 cell recovery and its progression after ART.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60073-8;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The induction of a potent and long-lasting, broadly neutralizing antibody response is one of the most promising approaches in HIV-1 vaccination. Recently, we demonstrated that Gagspecific T helper cells induced by DNA priming can enhance and modulate the HIV Env-specific B cell response upon virus-like particle (VLP) boost by intrastructural help (ISH). In order to minimize the induction of potentially harmful HIV specific TH cells, we explored the possibility to harness the heterologous TH cells induced by a recombinant tuberculosis subunit vaccine H1, which contains a fusion protein of Ag85B and ESAT-6 antigens in combination with the liposomal adjuvant CAF01. To provide ISH, immunodominant MHC-II restricted peptides from the H1 vaccine were genetically incorporated into the HIV 1 Gag protein and used for HIV VLP production. ISH effects on Envspecific antibody levels and B cell differentiation were analyzed in mice primed against H1 and boosted with VLPs. In contrast to non-primed mice, a significant increase of Env-specific IgG levels for up to 26 weeks after the last immunization was observed. This increase was largely caused by elevated IgG2b and IgG2c levels in mice that received H1 priming. Additionally, ISH enhanced the frequency of Env-specific long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow. In this study, we were able to demonstrate that a heterologous prime-boost regimen consisting of the H1 tuberculosis subunit vaccine and T helper epitope modified HIV-1 VLPs resulted in enhanced HIV Env antibody and B cell responses, mediated by intrastructural help.;https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/8/4/604;6.5;7.5;4.5;;;;;

Abbott Molecular recently released the Alinity m HIV-1 assay to be run on the Alinity m System, a fully automated, continuous and random access analyser using ReadiFlex™ technology. Objectives: Our study investigated the performance of the Alinity m HIV-1 assay in comparison to the cobas® HIV-1 test in a high-throughput molecular laboratory. Study design: We compared the performance of the Alinity m HIV-1 assay with the cobas® HIV-1 test, performed on both the cobas® 4800 and cobas® 6800 systems at three clinically relevant thresholds (50, 200 and 1000 cp/mL). Results: Excellent correlation (r = 0.98) and agreement (mean bias 0.004 Log10 cp/mL) was achieved between the cobas® 4800 and Alinity m HIV-1 assay. While there was good correlation between the Alinity m HIV-1 assay and the cobas® 6800 (r = 0.99), Bland-Altman analysis indicated that the cobas® 6800 on average measured 0.22 Log10 cp/mL higher than the Alinity m HIV-1 assay across the dynamic range. Percentage agreement was excellent at the 200 cp/mL and 1000 cp/mL thresholds and was slightly lower at 50 cp/mL in comparison with the cobas® systems.

Certain exposed individuals do not display T-cell immune conversion in these assays and do not develop TB. Here we report a hitherto unknown form of this phenotype: HIV-1-positive persistently TB, tuberculin and IGRA negative (HITTIN). Methods: A community-based case-control design was used to systematically screen and identify adults living with HIV (HIV+), aged 35–60 years, who met stringent study criteria, and then longitudinally followed up for repeat IGRA and TST testing. Participants had no history of TB despite living in TB hyper-endemic environments in Cape Town, South Africa with a provincial incidence of 681/100,000. Mtb-specific antibodies were measured using ELISA and Luminex. Findings: We identified 48/286 (17%) individuals who tested persistently negative for Mtb-specific T-cell immunoreactivity (three negative Quantiferon results and one TST = 0mm) over 206±154 days on average. Of these, 97·2% had documented CD4 counts<200 prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART). They had received ART for 7·0±3·0 years with a latest CD4 count of 505·8±191·4 cells/mm3. All HITTIN sent for further antibody testing (n=38) displayed Mtb-specific antibody titres. Interpretation: Immune reconstituted HIV+ persons can be persistently non-immunoreactive to TST and interferon- T-cell responses to Mtb, yet develop species-specific antibody responses. Exposure is evidenced by Mtb-specific antibody titres. Our identification of HIV+ individuals displaying a persisting lack of response to TST and IGRA T-cell immune conversion paves the way for future studies to investigate this phenotype in the context of HIV-infection that so far have received only scant attention.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352396420304291;6.0;8.4;8.7;;S2352396420304291;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2352396420304291;;

Nevertheless, various age-related pathologies such as neurocognitive disorders have emerged as serious complications. A “shock and kill” strategy using latency-reversing agents (LRA) to reactivate HIV-1 has been proposed to eliminate the viral reservoir in such chronically infected patients. However, the impact of LRA on the central nervous system remains elusive. Given that an increased amyloid beta (A) deposition is a feature of HIV-1-infected brains, we investigated the consequences of HIV-1 infection and treatment with two LRA (bryostatin-1 and JQ1) on the capacity of human astrocytes to engulf and clear A. We show here that HIV-1-infected astrocytes accumulate a very high amount of A compared to uninfected cells, but the engulfed peptide in degraded very slowly. The LRA bryostatin-1 induces a reduction in A endocytosis, whereas JQ1 treatment results in a very slow degradation of the ingested material associated with a reduced expression of the endopeptidase neprilysin. An exposure to JQ1 also induces a sustained release of A-loaded microvesicles. Thus, both HIV-1 infection and treatment with some LRA could contribute to the reported A accumulation in the brain of HIV-1-infected persons.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/glia.23833;11.3;10.2;10.0;08941491;;;;

The anti-retroviral therapy failure rate and the risk of HIV vertical transmission to infants from women with failed treatment during pregnancy also largely remains unevaluated. Methods: This is a prospective, observational and follow-up study of 18 months to determine the association of ART failure in pregnant women and the subsequent risk of HIV transmission to their infants. A total of 81 mothers were evaluated for ART success/failure by analysing their viral loads. Results: Analyses revealed that a high percentage (19.75%) of women on ART had high viral loads, while the overall HIV transmission rate to the infants was 8.64%. The rate of transmission from women with high viral load was significantly high compared to women with low viral load (37.5% vs. 1.54%; p = 0.0015). CD4 level was not associated with HIV transmission. However, CD4 levels in women, who had successful or failed ART, were significantly different (p = 0.0031). Factors such as mother’s age, baby’s sex and weight as well as delivery mode were not associated with HIV transmission, however, breastfeeding and viral loads were found to be independently associated with HIV transmission to the neonates. Conclusions: This study highlights that a significant proportion of women on ART had impaired viral load control.

Follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells are a recently characterised subset of CD4+T cells. Tfr also exerts an immunosuppressive effect on humoral immune system through interaction with follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, but the role of Tfr in HIV infection needs to be further elucidated. 20 treatment-naïve and 20 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated HIV-infected individuals were enrolled for cross-sectional study and nine complete responders (CRs) and eight immune non-responders (INRs) after ART were collected for retrospective cohort study. Tfr phenotypes, cytokine secretions, and apoptosis of those subjects were evaluated by flow cytometry. HIV DNA was measured by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Significantly increased circulating Tfr was observed in chronic HIV+ patients and the imbalance between Tfr and Tfh17 was associated with CD4+T counts. In addition, an elevated proportion of Tfr was associated with immune reconstruction failure of patients after ART. The IL-10 and CTLA-4 expressions of Tfr cells were up-regulated in treatment-naïve HIV+ patients. Ex vivo experiments showed IL-10 and CTLA-4 expressed by Tfr inhibited IL-21 secretion of Tfh. Tfr harboured a comparable HIV-1 DNA level with Tfh in HIV+ patients. Compared to Tfr of HCs, Tfr cells of HIV+ patients were more insensitive to CD95 and IFN- induced apoptosis, had a higher proliferation rate, and had more stem-like T cell (Tscm) phenotype. The anti-apoptosis feature, higher proliferation rate, and Tscm-like features of Tfr in HIV+ patients, led to the expansion of Tfr which in turn resulted in dysfunction of Tfh. Tfr cells were also involved in immune reconstruction failure and latent infection of HIV. Tfr cells were a novel, and potentially therapeutic, target for the cure of HIV infection, especially for HIV vaccine development and HIV reservoir elimination.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0163445320305958;8.1;7.5;8.0;01634453;S0163445320305958;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0163445320305958;;

Therefore, potential trimeric gp41 or gp140 immunogen candidates are needed. Previously, we developed a trimer motif MTQ and demonstrated that it could help formation of trimeric gp120 and gp140 proteins. In the present study, we immunized Balb/c mice using trimeric gp41-expressing plasmid for prime and monomeric gp41 or trimeric gp140 protein as well as a mutant (Q577A) for boost. The antibody responses in the context of regimens with various immunization intervals and DNA adjuvants including praziquantel (PZQ), cimetidine (CIM), and amiloride (AML) were evaluated. We found that these three adjuvants were not enough to elicit remarkable specific Abs after gp41 DNA immunization, while AML could significantly promote humoral immune responses after protein boosts. Long immunization interval could induce the specific binding Abs earlier and higher and maintain a high level of Abs in the following 27 weeks after final protein boost. Moreover, two times of protein boosts with DNA adjuvant and a longer time interval achieved a higher titer of specific Abs than three times of protein boosts with a shorter time interval. Q577A mutant was benefit for trimeric gp140 boost in the production of binding Abs but harmful to inducing neutralizing Abs, while this mutant in monomeric gp41 presented the opposite trend which may be associated with the immunogen structures. This study highlights the significance of DNA adjuvant Amiloride and long immunization interval in promoting antibody responses and provides new insights into effective HIV immunization regimen design in the future.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264410X20312597;6.0;5.7;5.5;0264410X;S0264410X20312597;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0264410X20312597;;

Its overexpression is enhanced by many factors such as exposure of the cells to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), HIV-1 envelop glycoprotein 120, hypoxia, or glucose deprivation. Thorough understanding of these interactions along with AEG-1 inducers and repressors is important in setting a successful treatment plan targeting this oncogene. Since its discovery in 2002, AEG-1 has made a significant impact in improving our understanding of mechanism of malignant tumors progression, such as breast carcinomas, melanoma, and malignant gliomas. Therefore, it has been a novel therapeutic target for the past two decades.

All rights reserved.Objective: Female sex workers (FSWs) under 20 years of age range from 1,000 to 575,000 in different cities and countries across the globe. There is only a handful of information on the reproductive health (RH) issues of these younger FSWs in the perspective of service utilization and healthcare system. We reviewed existing literature with a view to describe the reproductive health problems, service utilization, and service availability as well as information sources among the FSWs ages <20 years. Materials and methods: A web-based search using Google, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/ PubMed/ PubMed Central, HINARI and JSTOR was performed in English Language. The prevalence of a health issue and percentage of service utilization had been shown using ranges of minimum and maximum value which were calculated by different studies. Results: Findings identified the following RH problems: unintended pregnancies (52%-95%), induced abortion (51%-53%), repeated or multiple abortions (13%-43%), childbirth experiences, sexually transmitted infections (74%-84%), HIV (1%-60.6%), violence (beaten, robbed, not paid, forced or coerced sex, rape) and mental disorders (depression, suicidal thoughts). The consistent use of condom (26%-55%) was not satisfactory. Overall 64% of under 20 years FSWs reported little or no access to healthcare in the previous year and access to RH information sources was also poor. Conclusion: This review has potentially meant to bring forward the RH issues of younger FSWs to the policy makers and programme planners to implement targeted reproductive health interventions for the FSWs ages <20 years.;https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/BJMS/article/view/43870;0.2;0.3;0.3;22234721;;;;

In this study, double electron-electron resonance (DEER) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was utilized to gain insights in how natural polymorphisms in several African and Brazilian protease (PR) variants affect the conformational landscape both in the absence and presence of inhibitors. Findings show that Subtypes F and H HIV-1 PR adopt a primarily closed conformation in the unbound state with two secondary mutations, D60E and I62V, postulated to be responsible for the increased probability for closed conformation. In contrast, subtype D, CRF_AG, and CRF_BF HIV-1 PR adopt a primarily semi-open conformation, as observed for PI-naïve-subtype B when unbound by substrate or inhibitor. The impact that inhibitor binding has on shifting the conformational land scape of these variants is also characterized, where analysis provides classification of inhibitor induced shifts away from the semi-open state into weak, moderate and strong effects.

HIV-2 protease (PR2) is naturally resistant to most of them as PIs were designed for HIV-1 protease (PR1). In this study, we explored the impact of amino-acid substitutions between PR1 and PR2 on the structure of protease (PR) by comparing the structural variability of 13 regions using 24 PR1 and PR2 structures complexed with diverse ligands. Our analyses confirmed structural rigidity of the catalytic region and highlighted the important role of three regions in the conservation of the catalytic region conformation. Surprisingly, we showed that the flap region, corresponding to a flexible region, exhibits similar conformations in PR1 and PR2. Furthermore, we identified regions exhibiting different conformations in PR1 and PR2, which could be explained by the intrinsic flexibility of these regions, by crystal packing, or by PR1 and PR2 substitutions. Some substitutions induce structural changes in the R2 and R4 regions that could have an impact on the properties of PI-binding site and could thus modify PI binding mode. Substitutions involved in structural changes in the elbow region could alter the flexibility of the PR2 flap regions relative to PR1, and thus play a role in the transition from the semi-open form to the closed form, and have an impact on ligand binding. These results improve the understanding of the impact of sequence variations between PR1 and PR2 on the natural resistance of HIV-2 to commercially available PIs. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

It has been reported that peptide-like anti-HIV-1 drugs are effective against SARS-CoV Main protease (Mpro). Due to the close phylogenetic relationship between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, their main proteases share many structural and functional features. Thus, these drugs are also regarded as potential drug candidates targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. However, the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro at the atomic-level is unknown. In the present study, we revealed key interactions between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and three drug candidates by performing pharmacophore modeling and 1 s molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. His41, Gly143, and Glu166 formed interactions with the functional groups that were common among peptide-like inhibitors in all MD simulations.

CLK1 belongs to the CLK kinase family that regulates alternative splicing through phosphorylation of serine-arginine rich (SR) proteins. Recent studies have demonstrated that CLK1 has an important role in the replication of influenza A and chikungunya viruses. Furthermore, CLK1 was found to be relevant for the replication of HIV-1 and the West Nile virus, making CLK1 an interesting cellular candidate for the development of a host-directed antiviral therapy that might be efficient for treatment of newly emerging viruses. We describe here our attempts and detailed procedures to obtain the recombinant kinase domain of CLK1 in suitable amounts for crystallization in complex with specific inhibitors. The key solution for the reproducibility of crystals resides in devising and refining expression and purification protocols leading to homogeneous protein. Co-expression of CLK1 with -phosphatase and careful purification has yielded crystals of CLK1 complexed with the KH-CB19 inhibitor that diffracted to 1.65 Å. These results paved the path to the screening of more structures of CLK1 complexed compounds, leading to further optimization of their inhibitory activity. Moreover, since kinases are desired targets in numerous pathologies, the approach we report here, the co-expression of kinases with -phosphatase, previously used in other kinases, can be adopted as a general protocol in numerous kinase targets for obtaining reproducible and homogenic non-phosphorylated (inactive) forms suitable for biochemical and structural studies thus facilitating the development of novel inhibitors.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1046592820303338;2.6;2.6;2.8;10465928;S1046592820303338;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1046592820303338;;

Under this scenario, the combination of two HIV-1 protease inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, has attracted attention since they have been previously employed against the SARS-CoV main proteinase (Mpro) and exhibited some signs of effectiveness. Recently, the 3D structure of SARS-CoV2 Mpro was constructed based on the monomeric SARS-CoV Mpro and employed to identify potential approved small inhibitors against SARS-CoV2 Mpro, allowing the selection of 15 drugs among 1903 approved drugs to be employed. In this study, we performed docking of these 15 approved drugs against the recently solved X-ray crystallography structure of SARS-CoV2 Mpro in the monomeric and dimeric states; the latter is the functional state that was determined in a biological context, and these were submitted to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) approach to obtain insight into the inhibitory activity of these compounds. Similar studies were performed with lopinavir and ritonavir coupled to monomeric and dimeric SARS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV2 Mpro to compare the inhibitory differences. Our study provides the structural and energetic basis of the inhibitory properties of lopinavir and ritonavir on SARS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV2 Mpro, allowing us to identify two FDA-approved drugs that can be used against SARS-CoV2 Mpro. This study also demonstrated that drug discovery requires the dimeric state to obtain good results.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1093326320305519;2.6;3.0;3.4;10933263;S1093326320305519;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1093326320305519;;

Here we establish the tetraspanin CD151 as a unique marker of T-cell activation and, in extension, an indicator of elevated, systemic T-cell activity. Baseline CD151 expression found on a subset of T-cells was indicative of increased activation of the MAPK pathway. Following TCR/CD3 activation, CD151 expression was upregulated on the overall T-cell population, a quintessential feature of an activation marker. CD151+ T-cell frequencies in the spleen, an organ with increased immune activity, were twice as high as in paired peripheral blood samples. This CD151+ T-cell frequency increase was not paralleled by an increase of CD25 or CD38, demonstrating that CD151 expression is regulated independently of other T-cell activation markers. CD151+ T-cells were also more likely to express preformed granzyme B, suggesting that CD151+ T cells are pro-inflammatory. To this end, HIV-1 patients on antiretroviral therapy who are reported to exhibit chronically elevated levels of immune activity, had significantly higher CD4+CD151+ T-cell frequencies than healthy controls, raising the possibility that proinflammatory CD151+ T cells could contribute to the premature immunological aging phenotype observed in these patients.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72719-8;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

RTs vary in performance characteristics therefore the selection of RTs in an algorithm may affect identification of infection, particularly if acute. National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) assessed RTAs among men who have sex with men recruited using anonymous venue-based sampling. Different algorithms were evaluated among participants who self-reported never having received a positive HIV test result prior to the interview. NHBS project areas performed sequential or parallel RTs using whole blood. Participants with at least one reactive RT were offered anonymous linkage to care and provided a dried blood spot (DBS) for testing at CDC. Discordant results (RT-1 reactive/RT-2 non-reactive) were tested at CDC with lab protocols modified for DBS. DBS were also tested for HIV-1 RNA (VL) and antiretroviral (ARV) drug levels. Of 6500 RTAs, 238 were RT-1 reactive; of those, 97.1% (231/238) had concordant results (RT-1/RT-2 reactive) and 2.9% (7/238) had discordant results. Five DBS associated with discordant results were available for confirmation at CDC. Four had non-reactive confirmatory test results that implied RT-1 false reactivity; one had ambiguous confirmatory test results which was non-reactive in further testing. Regardless of order and type of RT used, RTAs demonstrated high concordant results in the population surveyed. Additional laboratory testing on DBS following discordant results confirmed no infection. Implementing RTAs in the context of anonymous venue-based HIV testing could be an option when laboratory follow-up is not practicable.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10900-020-00871-3;2.8;2.6;2.8;00945145;;;;

This induction of IDO-1 is dependent on the secondary structure of Tat protein, since stimulation with a chemically oxidized Tat protein loses its capacity to induce the production of IDO-1. Among the variety of candidate receptors described for Tat, we demonstrated that Tat protein interacted physically with TLR4/MD2 complex. Strikingly, blockade of Tat-TLR4 interaction by anti-TLR4 antibodies (clone HTA125), LPS-RS, a known TLR4 antagonist, or by soluble recombinant TLR4/MD2 complex inhibited strongly or totally the capacity of Tat to induce IDO-1 in MoDC while such treatments had no effect on IFN--induced IDO-1. Furthermore, we showed that the activation of the transcription factor NF-B by Tat is essential for the production of IDO-1 by human MoDC. Indeed, Tat activated NF-B pathway in MoDC as demonstrated by the phosphorylation of p65 in Tat-treated MoDC. Further, we demonstrate that the stimulation of IDO-1 by Tat or by IFN- was totally or partially inhibited in the presence of NF-B inhibitor respectively. These results suggest that Tat and IFN- act probably by two distinct mechanisms to induce the production of IDO-1. Our results clearly demonstrated that, although TLR4 pathway is necessary for Tat-induced IDO-1 in MoDC, it seems not to be sufficient since stable transfection of a functional TLR4/MD2 pathway in HEK or HeLa cell lines which are endogenously defectives for TLR4, did not restore the capacity of Tat to induce IDO-1 while IFN- treatment induces IDO-1 in HeLa cells independently of TLR4 pathway. These results suggest the involvement of additional stimuli in addition to TLR4 pathway which remain to be identified. Altogether our results demonstrated that, in human MoDC, HIV-1 Tat protein induced IDO-1 expression and activity in a NF-B dependent-manner by recruiting TLR4 pathway.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64847-y;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

We identified a HIV-1-seropositive woman who spontaneously suppressed HIV replication and had normal CD4-cell counts, no HIV-disease, no replication-competent virus and no cell HIV DNA detected with a routine assay. We suspected that dramatic HIV DNA degradation occurred post-infection. We performed multiple nested-PCRs followed by Sanger sequencing and applied a multiplex-PCR approach. Furthermore, we implemented a new technique based on two hybridization steps on beads prior to next-generation sequencing that removed human DNA then retrieved integrated HIV sequences with HIV-specific probes. We assembled 45% of the HIV genome and further analyzed the G-to-A mutations putatively generated by cellular APOBEC3 enzymes that can change tryptophan codons into stop codons. We found more G-to-A mutations in the HIV DNA from the woman than in that of her transmitting partner. Moreover, 74% of the tryptophan codons were changed to stop codons (25%) or were deleted as a possible consequence of gene inactivation. Finally, we found that this woman’s cells remained HIV-susceptible in vitro. Our findings show that she does not exhibit innate HIV-resistance but may have been cured of it by extrinsic factors, a plausible candidate for which is the gut microbiota.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-58969-6;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

The structures of new daphnane diterpenes (1–3) were determined on the basis of extensive spectroscopic methods and the known daphnane diterpenes (4–11) were identified by comparing their observable spectroscopic data with those reported spectral data in the literature. The anti-inflammatory effects as well as anti-HIV activities in vitro of all isolated daphnane diterpenes 1–11 were assessed. As a consequence, daphnane diterpenes 1–11 displayed remarkable inhibitory activities on NO (nitric oxide) production induced by lipopolysaccharide in mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells showing IC50 values in the range of 0.12 ± 0.03 to 10.58 ± 0.16 µM. Meanwhile, daphnane diterpenes 1–11 displayed significant anti-HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) effects showing EC50 values ranging from 0.09509 to 8.62356 µM. These research results indicated that the discovery of these new daphnane diterpenes with remarkable anti-inflammatory and anti-HIV activities from W. chuii, especially these new ones, could be extremely meaningful to the discovery of new anti-inflammatory agents and anti-HIV drugs as well as their potential practical values in the health and pharmaceutical products.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0045206820316862;4.8;4.3;4.5;00452068;S0045206820316862;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0045206820316862;;

However, the design and use of multi-facial helix mimetics remains in its infancy. Here we describe the synthesis and application of novel bilaterally substituted p-terphenyl compounds containing positively-charged aminoalkyl groups in relative 1,4 positions across the aromatic scaffold. These compounds were specifically designed to mimic all faces of the arginine-rich -helix of the HIV-1 protein Rev, which forms deeply embedded RNA complexes and plays key roles in the virus replication cycle. Two of these molecules recognized the Rev site in the viral RNA and inhibited the formation of the RRE-Rev ribonucleoprotein complex, a currently unexploited target in HIV chemotherapy. Cellular assays revealed that the most active compounds blocked HIV-1 replication with little toxicity, and likely exerted this effect through a multi-target mechanism involving inhibition of viral LTR promoter-dependent transcription and Rev function. Further development of this scaffold may open new avenues for targeting nucleic acids and may complement current HIV therapies, none of which involve inhibitors interfering with the gene regulation processes of the virus.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64120-2;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

Many NGS HIVDR data analysis pipelines have been independently developed, each with variable outputs and data management protocols. Standardization of such analytical methods and comparison of available pipelines are lacking, yet may impact subsequent HIVDR interpretation and other downstream applications. Here we compared the performance of five NGS HIVDR pipelines using proficiency panel samples from NIAID Virology Quality Assurance (VQA) program. Ten VQA panel specimens were genotyped by each of six international laboratories using their own in-house NGS assays. Raw NGS data were then processed using each of the five different pipelines including HyDRA, MiCall, PASeq, Hivmmer and DEEPGEN. All pipelines detected amino acid variants (AAVs) at full range of frequencies (1~100%) and demonstrated good linearity as compared to the reference frequency values. While the sensitivity in detecting low abundance AAVs, with frequencies between 1~20%, is less a concern for all pipelines, their specificity dramatically decreased at AAV frequencies <2%, suggesting that 2% threshold may be a more reliable reporting threshold for ensured specificity in AAV calling and reporting. More variations were observed among the pipelines when low abundance AAVs are concerned, likely due to differences in their NGS read quality control strategies. Findings from this study highlight the need for standardized strategies for NGS HIVDR data analysis, especially for the detection of minority HIVDR variants.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-58544-z;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

Drug resistant HIV variants, including minority variants, can compromise response to antiretroviral therapy. Many studies have investigated the clinical relevance of drug resistant minority variants, but the level at which minority variants become clinically relevant remains unclear. A combination of Primer-ID and deep sequencing is a promising approach that may quantify minority variants more accurately compared to standard deep sequencing. However, most studies that used the Primer-ID method have analyzed clinical samples directly. Thus, its sensitivity and quantitative accuracy have not been adequately validated using known controls. Here, we constructed defined proportions of artificial RNA and virus quasispecies and measured their relative proportions using the Primer-ID based, quantitative single-variant sequencing (qSVS) assay. Our results showed that minority variants present at 1% of quasispecies were detected reproducibly with minimal variations between technical replicates. In addition, the measured frequencies were comparable to the expected frequencies. These data validate the accuracy and reproducibility of the qSVS assay in quantifying authentic HIV minority variants, and support the use of this approach to examine the impacts of minority HIV variants on virologic response and clinical outcome.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65085-y;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

In CD4+ myeloid lineage and resting T-cells, SAMHD1 blocks HIV-1 and other viral infections by depletion of the dNTP pool to a level that cannot support replication. SAMHD1 mutations are associated with the autoimmune disease Aicardi–Goutières syndrome and hypermutated cancers. Furthermore, SAMHD1 sensitises cancer cells to nucleoside-analogue anti-cancer therapies and is linked with DNA repair and suppression of the interferon response to cytosolic nucleic acids. Nevertheless, despite its requirement in these processes, the fundamental mechanism of SAMHD1-catalysed dNTP hydrolysis remained unknown. Here, we present structural and enzymological data showing that SAMHD1 utilises an active site, bi-metallic iron-magnesium centre that positions a hydroxide nucleophile in-line with the P-O5 bond to catalyse phosphoester bond hydrolysis. This precise molecular mechanism for SAMHD1 catalysis, reveals how SAMHD1 down-regulates cellular dNTP and modulates the efficacy of nucleoside-based anti-cancer and anti-viral therapies.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16983-2;18.5;18.1;18.1;;;;;

Plasma (PL) and seminal fluid (SF) were available for all patients, whole blood (WB) for seven, non-spermatozoid cells (NSC) for four, and saliva (SAL) for three. Median HIV-1 RNA was 6.2 log10 copies/mL [IQR: 5.5–6.95] in PL, 4.9 log10 copies/mL [IQR: 4.25–5.29] in SF, and 4.9 log10 copies/mL [IQR: 4.46–5.09] in SAL. Median HIV-1 DNA was 4.1 log10 copies/106 PBMCs [IQR: 3.15–4.15] in WB and 2.6 log10 copies /106 Cells [IQR: 2.23–2.75] in NSC. The median overall diversity per patient varied from 0.0005 to 0.0232, suggesting very low diversity, confirmed by the clonal aspect of most of the phylogenetic trees. One single haplotype was present in all compartments for five patients in the earliest stage of infection. Evidence of higher diversity was established for two patients in PL and WB, suggesting compartmentalization. Our study shows low diversity of the env gene in the first stages of infection followed by the rapid establishment of cellular reservoirs of the virus. Such clonality could be exploited in the search for early patient-specific therapeutic solutions.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59234-6;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

Additionally, SHIVs that encode the HIV-1 Env protein and are infectious to macaques have many strains that show different pathogenesis, such as the highly pathogenic SHIV-KS661 and the less pathogenic SHIV-#64. Therefore, we used SHIVs to understand different aspects of AIDS pathogenesis. In a previous study, we established a mathematical model of in vivo early SHIV infection dynamics, which revealed the expected uninfected and infected dynamics in Rhesus macaques. In concrete, the number of uninfected CD4+ T cells in SHIV-KS661-infected Rhesus macaques decreased more significantly and rapidly than that of SHIV-#64 Rhesus macaques, and these Rhesus macaques did not any induce host immune response. In contrast, the number of uninfected CD4+ T cells in SHIV-#64-infected Rhesus macaques is maintained, and host immune response developed. Although we considered that the peak viral load might determine whether systemic CD4+ T cell depletion occurs or host immune responses develop, we could not investigate this because our model quantified only SHIV infection prior to the development of the pathogenicity or host immune responses. Therefore, we developed a new mathematical model to investigate why SHIV-#64 and SHIV-KS661 showed different long-term viral dynamics. We fitted our new model considering antibody responses to our experimental datasets that included antibody titers, CD4+ T cells, and viral load data. We performed a maximum likelihood estimation using a non-linear mixed effect model. From the results, we derived the basic reproduction numbers of SHIV-#64 and SHIV-KS661 from intravenous infection (IV) and SHIV-KS661 from intrarectal infection (IR), as well as the antiviral effects of antibodies against SHIV-#64(IV) and SHIV-KS661(IR). We found significant differences between the basic reproduction number of SHIV-#64(IV) or -KS661(IR) and that of SHIV-KS661(IV). We found no clear difference between the antiviral effects of SHIV-#64(IV) and SHIV-KS661(IR), and revealed that an antiviral effect more than 90% of that of maximum antibody responses was induced from initial antibody responses (i.e., antibody response just after its inducement). In conclusion, we found that the basic reproduction number, rather than SHIV strains determines whether systemic CD4+ T cell depletion develops, and the subsequent antibody responses occurs.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022519320303489;4.0;3.9;4.1;00225193;S0022519320303489;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0022519320303489;;

Nevertheless, sequencing technologies have different error rates, which occur during the sequencing process. If the NGS data is used for diagnostics, these sequences with errors are typically neglected or a worst-case scenario is assumed. In the current study, we focused on the impact of ambiguous bases on therapy recommendations for Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) patients. Concretely, we analyzed the treatment recommendation with entry blockers based on prediction models for co-receptor tropism. We compared three different error handling strategies that have been used in the literature, namely (i) neglection, (ii) worst-case assumption, and (iii) deconvolution with a majority vote. We could show that for two or more ambiguous positions per sequence a reliable prediction is generally no longer possible. Moreover, also the position of ambiguity plays a crucial role. Thus, we analyzed the error probability distributions of existing sequencing technologies, e.g., Illumina MiSeq or PacBio, with respect to the aforementioned error handling strategies and it turned out that neglection outperforms the other strategies in the case where no systematic errors are present. In other cases, the deconvolution strategy with the majority vote should be preferred.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62675-8;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

Furthermore, the ability to generate comprehensive interactomes has enabled the appraisal of each PPI in the context of all predictions leading to further improvements in classification performance in the face of extreme class imbalance using the Reciprocal Perspective (RP) framework. We here describe the PIPE4 algorithm. Adaptation of the PIPE3/MP-PIPE sequence preprocessing step led to upwards of 50x speedup and the new Similarity Weighted Score appropriately normalizes for window frequency when applied to any inter- and cross-species prediction schemas. Comprehensive interactomes for three prediction schemas are generated: (1) cross-species predictions, where Arabidopsis thaliana is used as a proxy to predict the comprehensive Glycine max interactome, (2) inter-species predictions between Homo sapiens-HIV1, and (3) a combined schema involving both cross- and inter-species predictions, where both Arabidopsis thaliana and Caenorhabditis elegans are used as proxy species to predict the interactome between Glycine max (the soybean legume) and Heterodera glycines (the soybean cyst nematode). Comparing PIPE4 with the state-of-the-art resulted in improved performance, indicative that it should be the method of choice for complex PPI prediction schemas.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-56895-w;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

As aberrant protein regulation is suggested to be a shared pathological feature amongst many neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD), disruptions in neuronal lipid processing may contribute to disease progression in the CNS. Specifically, given the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dual role in lipid homeostasis as well as protein quality control (PQC) via unfolded protein response (UPR), lipid dysregulation in the CNS may converge on ER functioning and constitute a crucial mechanism underlying aberrant protein aggregation. In the current review, we discuss the diverse roles of lipid species as essential components of the CNS. Moreover, given the importance of both lipid dysregulation and protein aggregation in pathology of CNS diseases, we attempt to assess the potential downstream cross-talk between lipid dysregulation and ER dependent PQC mechanisms, with special focus on HIV-associated neurodegenerative disorders (HAND).;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0197018620302710;6.3;6.4;5.9;01970186;S0197018620302710;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0197018620302710;;

The current design strategy of soluble forms of Env in native-like trimeric conformation induces neutralizing antibodies with minimal breadth and potency. Extensive shielding by N-glycans on the surface of the HIV-1 Env acts as an immune evasion mechanism by restricting B cell recognition of conserved neutralizing determinants. An alternate approach is to design Env protein with glycan deletion to expose the protein surface. Methods: A stable native-like trimeric Env with glycan holes at potentially immunogenic locations is expected to elicit better induction of germ-line B-cells due to exposure of the immunogenic regions. However, the extent and consequences of glycan removal from the trimer apex that form an important epitope is not explored. In this work, we have designed a construct with glycans deleted from the trimer apex of an Indian clade C origin Env that has previously been characterized for immunogenicity, to understand the impact of deglycosylation on the structural and functional integrity as well as on the antibody binding properties. Results: The V1V2 glycan-deleted protein maintains native-like trimeric conformation with improved accessibility of the V1V2-directed germ-line antibodies. Furthermore, we showed that the protein binds specifically to quaternary conformation-dependent bnAbs but minimally to non-neutralizing antibodies. Conclusions: This study provide an important design aspect of HIV-1 Env-based immunogens with glycan holes in the apex region that could be useful in eliciting apex directed antibodies in immunization studies.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0304416520302452;8.8;7.4;7.4;03044165;S0304416520302452;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0304416520302452;;

While it was generally assumed that the neutralizing antibody (NAb) response depended mainly on the infected individual, the concept that virus-related factors could be important in inducing this response has recently emerged. Here, we analyzed the influence of the infecting viral strain in shaping NAb responses in four HIV-1 infected subjects belonging to a transmission chain. We also explored the impact of NAb responses on the functional evolution of the viral quasispecies. The four patients developed a strong autologous neutralizing antibody response that drove viral escape and coincided with a parallel evolution of their infecting quasispecies towards increasing infectious properties, increasing susceptibility to T20 and increasing resistance to both CD4 analogs and V3 loop-directed NAbs. This evolution was associated with identical Env sequence changes at several positions in the V3 loop, the fusion peptide and the HR2 domain of gp41. The common evolutionary pattern of Env in different hosts suggests that the capacity of a given Env to adapt to changing environments may be restricted by functional constraints that limit its evolutionary landscape.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73975-4;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

Here, we deepen our understanding of prazole budding inhibition by studying a range of viruses in the presence of tenatoprazole. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between the chemistry of prodrug activation and HIV-1 inhibition for diverse prazoles currently on the market. We report that tenatoprazole is capable of inhibiting the replication of members of the enveloped filo, alpha, and herpes virus families but not the flavivirus group and not the non-enveloped poliovirus. Another key finding is that prazole prodrugs must be activated inside the cell, while their rate of activation in vitro correlated to their efficacy in cells. Our study lays the groundwork for future efforts to repurpose prazole-based compounds as antivirals that are both broad-spectrum and selective in nature.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60544-y;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

Higher-ordered oligomerization of this protein forms hexagonally patterned structures that wrap around the viral capsid, despite an anomalously low affinity for the capsid protein (CA). Several studies suggest TRIM5 oligomerizes into a lattice with a symmetry and spacing that matches the underlying capsid, to compensate for the weak affinity, yet little is known about how these lattices form. Using a combination of computational simulations and electron cryo-tomography imaging, we reveal the dynamical mechanisms by which these lattices self-assemble. Constrained diffusion allows the lattice to reorganize, whereas defects form on highly curved capsid surfaces to alleviate strain and lattice symmetry mismatches.

Here we investigate the response of MAIT cells during acute HIV-1 infection utilizing the RV217 cohort with paired longitudinal pre- and post-infection samples. MAIT cells are activated and expand in blood and mucosa coincident with peak HIV-1 viremia, in a manner associated with emerging microbial translocation. This is followed by a phase with elevated function as viral replication is controlled to a set-point level, and later by their functional decline at the onset of chronic infection. Interestingly, enhanced innate-like pathways and characteristics develop progressively in MAIT cells during infection, in parallel with TCR repertoire alterations. These findings delineate the dynamic MAIT cell response to acute HIV-1 infection, and show how the MAIT compartment initially responds and expands with enhanced function, followed by progressive reprogramming away from TCR-dependent antibacterial responses towards innate-like functionality.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13975-9;18.5;18.1;18.1;;;;;

Prodrugs of 1 incorporating simple (carbonyl)oxyalkyl-based linkers and a primary amine in the promoiety were found to exhibit low chemical stability. However, chemical stability was improved by modifying the primary amine moiety to a tertiary amine, resulting in a 2-fold enhancement of exposure in rats following oral dosing compared to dosing of the parent drug 1. Further refinement of the linker resulted in the discovery of 22 as a prodrug that delivered the parent 1 to rat plasma with a 5-fold higher AUC and 67-fold higher C24 when compared to oral administration of the parent drug.

HIV-1, like other eukaryotic viruses, and its infected host exploit the proteasomal degradation system for their respective proliferation and survival, using various PTMs, including but not limited to ubiquitination, SUMOylation, NEDDylation, interferon-stimulated gene (ISG)ylation. Essentially all viral proteins within the virions -- and in the HIV-1-infected cells -- interact with their cellular counterparts for this degradation, utilizing ubiquitin (Ub), and the Ub-like (Ubl) modifiers less frequently, to eliminate the involved proteins throughout the virus life cycle, from the entry step to release of the assembled virus particles. Such interplay is pivotal for, on the one hand, the cell to restrict proliferation of the infecting virus, and on the other, for molecular counteraction by the virus to overcome this cellular protein-imposed restriction. Recent reports indicate that not only viral/cellular proteins but also viral/viral protein interactions play vital roles in regulating viral protein stability. We hence give an overview of the molecular processes of PTMs involved in proteasomal degradation of the viral and cellular proteins, and the viral/viral and viral/cellular protein interplay in restriction and competition for HIV-1 vs. host cell survival. Insights in this realm could open new avenues for developing therapeutics against HIV-1 via targeting specific steps of the proteasome degradation pathway during the HIV-1 life cycle.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168170220310492;5.1;4.9;5.3;01681702;S0168170220310492;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0168170220310492;;

While several mathematical models have been explored in the context of LTR-protein interactions, in this work for the first time HIV-1 LTR model featuring repressed, intermediate, and activated LTR states is integrated with generation of long (env) and short (TAR) RNAs and proteins (Tat, Pr55, and p24) in T-cells and macrophages using both cell lines and infected primary cells. This type of extended modeling framework allows us to compare and contrast behavior of these two cell types. We demonstrate that they exhibit unique LTR dynamics, which ultimately results in differences in the magnitude of viral products generated. One of the distinctive features of this work is that it relies on experimental data in reaction rate computations. Two RNA transcription rates from the activated promoter states are fit by comparison of experimental data to model predictions. Fitting to the data also provides estimates for the degradation/exit rates for long and short viral RNA. Our experimentally generated data is in reasonable agreement for the T-cell as well macrophage population and gives strong evidence in support of using the proposed integrated modeling paradigm. Sensitivity analysis performed using Latin hypercube sampling method confirms robustness of the model with respect to small parameter perturbations. Finally, incorporation of a transcription inhibitor (F07#13) into the governing equations demonstrates how the model can be used to assess drug efficacy. Collectively, our model indicates transcriptional differences between latently HIV-1 infected T-cells and macrophages and provides a novel platform to study various transcriptional dynamics leading to latency or activation in numerous cell types and physiological conditions.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59008-0;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated, encoding around 66–87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Here, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the formation of oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which were absent on SARS and HKU1 CoVs. We provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic epitopes.

We investigated circulating antibody specificities in two phase 1 poxvirus prime-protein boost clinical trials conducted in South Africa: HVTN 097 (subtype B/E) and HVTN 100 (subtype C). With cross-subtype peptide microarrays and multiplex binding assays, we probed the magnitude and breadth of circulating antibody responses to linear variable loop 2 (V2) and conformational V1V2 specificities. Antibodies targeting the linear V2 epitope, a correlate of decreased HIV-1 risk in RV144, were elicited up to 100% and 61% in HVTN 097 and HVTN 100, respectively. Despite higher magnitude of envelope-specific responses in HVTN 100 compared to HVTN 097 (p’s < 0.001), the magnitude and positivity for V2 linear epitope and V1V2 proteins were significantly lower in HVTN 100 compared to HVTN 097. Meanwhile, responses to other major linear epitopes including the variable 3 (V3) and constant 5 (C5) epitopes were higher in HVTN 100 compared to HVTN 097. Our data reveal substantial differences in the circulating antibody specificities induced by vaccination in these two canarypox prime-protein boost trials. Our findings suggest that the choice of viral sequences in prime-boost vaccine regimens, and potentially adjuvants and immunogen dose, influence the elicitation of V2-specific antibodies.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57491-z;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

This information has led to the development of state-of the-art bioinformatic tools that are useful to predict co-receptor usage based on the V3 loop sequence mainly of subtypes B, C and A. However, these methods show a poor performance for subtype F V3 loops, which are found in an increasing number of HIV-1 strains worldwide. In the present work we investigated determinants of viral tropisms in the understudied subtype F by looking at genotypic and structural information of coreceptor:V3 loop interactions in a novel group of 40 subtype F V3 loops obtained from HIV-1 strains phenotypically characterized either as syncytium inducing or non-syncytium inducing by the MT-2 assay. We provide novel information about estimated interactions energies between a set of V3 loops with known tropism in subtype F, that allowed us to improve predictions of the coreceptor usage for this subtype. Understanding genetic and structural features underlying HIV coreceptor usage across different subtypes is relevant for the rational design of preventive and therapeutic strategies aimed at limiting the HIV-1 epidemic worldwide.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69408-x;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

However, HIV-1 often acquires resistance to PIs. Here, seven novel PIs were synthesized, by introducing single atom changes such as an exchange of a sulfur to an oxygen, scission of a single bond in P2-cyclopropylaminobenzothiazole (or -oxazole), and/or P1-benzene ring with fluorine scan of mono- or bis-fluorine atoms around DRV’s scaffold. X-ray structural analyses of the PIs complexed with wild-type Protease (PRWT) and highly-multi-PI-resistance-associated PRDRVRP51 revealed that the PIs better adapt to structural plasticity in PR with resistance-associated amino acid substitutions by formation of optimal sulfur bond and adaptation of cyclopropyl ring in the S2-subsite. Furthermore, these PIs displayed increased cell permeability and extreme anti-HIV-1 potency compared to DRV. Our work provides the basis for developing novel PIs with high potency against PI-resistant HIV-1 variants with a high genetic barrier.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65993-z;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

Among these, CCR5 and CXCR4 play pivotal roles in cancer metastasis and HIV-1 transmission and infection. They act as essential co-receptors for HIV and furnish a route to the cell entry. In particular, inhibition of either CCR5 or CXCR4 leads very often the virus to shift to a more virulent dual-tropic strain. Therefore, dual receptor inhibition might improve the therapeutic strategies against HIV. In this study, we aimed to discover selective CCR5, CXCR4, and dual CCR5/CXCR4 antagonists using both receptor- and ligand-based computational methods. We employed this approach to fully incorporate the interaction attributes of the binding pocket together with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding free energy calculations. The best hits were evaluated for their anti-HIV-1 activity against CXCR4- and CCR5-specific NL4.3 and BaL strains. Moreover, the Ca2+ mobilization assay was used to evaluate their antagonistic activity. From the 27 tested compounds, three were identified as inhibitors: compounds 27 (CCR5), 6 (CXCR4) and 3 (dual) with IC50 values ranging from 10.64 to 64.56 M. The binding mode analysis suggests that the active compounds form a salt bridge with the glutamates and -stacking interactions with the aromatic side chains binding site residues of the respective co-receptor. The presented hierarchical virtual screening approach provides essential aspects in identifying potential antagonists in terms of selectivity against a specific co-receptor. The compounds having multiple heterocyclic nitrogen atoms proved to be relatively more specific towards CXCR4 inhibition as compared to CCR5. The identified compounds serve as a starting point for further development of HIV entry inhibitors through synthesis and quantitative structure-activity relationship studies.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0928098720303250;5.7;5.4;6.6;09280987;S0928098720303250;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0928098720303250;;

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the major impediment for penetration of antiretroviral drugs, causing therapeutics to reach only suboptimal level to the brain. Conventional antiretroviral drug regimens are not sufficient to improve the treatment outcomes of HAND. In our recent report, we have developed a poloxamer-PLGA nanoformulation loaded with elvitegravir (EVG), a commonly used antiretroviral drug. The nanoformulated EVG is capable of elevating intracellular drug uptake and simultaneously enhance viral suppression in HIV-1-infected macrophages. In this work, we identified the clinical parameters including stability, biocompatibility, protein corona, cellular internalization pathway of EVG nanoformulation for its potential clinical translation. We further assessed the ability of this EVG nanoformulation to cross the in vitro BBB model and suppress the HIV-1 in macrophage cells. Compared with EVG native drug, our EVG nanoformulation demonstrated an improved BBB model penetration cross the in vitro BBB model and an enhanced HIV-1 suppression in HIV-1-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages after crossing the BBB model without altering the BBB model integrity. Overall, this is an innovative and optimized treatment strategy that has a potential for therapeutic interventions in reducing HAND.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60684-1;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

In this study, we performed a detailed characterization of strain-specific variability of sequences from the U5 to upstream of the gag gene start codon of diverse HIV-1 strains by using next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques. Overall, we found that this region of the HIV-1 genome displayed a low degree of intra-strain variability. On the other hand, inter-strain variability was found to be as high as that reported for gag and env genes (13–17%). We observed strain-specific single point and clustered mutations in the U5, PBS, and gag leader sequences (GLS), generating potential strain-specific transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Using an infrared gel shift assay, we demonstrated the presence of potential TFBS such as E-box in CRF22_01A, and Stat 6 in subtypes A and G, as well as in their related CRFs. The strain-specific variation found in the sequence corresponding at the RNA level to functional domains of the 5 UTR, could also potentially impact the secondary/tertiary structural rearrangement of this region. Thus, the variability observed in this 5 end of the genomic region of divergent HIV-1 strains strongly suggests that functions of this region might be affected in a strain-specific manner. Our findings provide new insights into DNA–protein interactions that regulate HIV-1 replication and the influence of strain characterization on the biology of HIV-1 infection.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70083-1;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

Since the discovery of HIV-1 circulating recombinant form CRF 85_BC in Southwest China in 2016, this BC recombinant forms had been reported in different regions of China. However, the history and magnitude of CRF85_BC transmission were still to be investigated. Method: We conducted the most recent molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 among newly reported HIV-1 infected patients in Sichuan in 2019 by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 1291 pol sequences. Then, we used maximum likelihood approach and the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of pol sequences to reconstruct the phylogeographic and demographic dynamics of the CRF85_BC. Results: HIV-1 CRF85_BC (68/1291, 5.27%) became the fourth most prevalent strain revealing a significant increase in local population. CRF85_BC were only found in heterosexually infected individuals and the majority of CRF85_BC (95.45%) were circulating among the people living with HIV aged 50 years and over (PLHIV50+), suggesting a unique prevalent pattern. The founder lineages of CRF85_BC were likely to have first emerged in Yunnan, a province of Southwest China bordering Sichuan, in the early 2000s. It then spread exponentially to various places (including Guangxi, Sichuan, et al) and became endemic around 2008.6 (2006.7–2010.2) in Sichuan. Conclusion: Taken together, our findings on HIV-1 subtype CRF85_BC infections provided new insights into the spread of this virus and extended the understanding of the HIV epidemic in China.;https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05488-4;4.5;4.3;4.1;;;;;

It is a potential target for inhibitors of viral fusion, but its hydrophobic nature and proximity to membrane in situ has precluded ready analysis of inhibitor interactions. Methods: We evaluated the sensitivity of 19F NMR and fluorescence for detecting peptide and small molecule binding to the HP and explored the effect of non-denaturing detergent or phospholipid as cosolvents and potential mimics of the membrane environment surrounding gp41. Results: Chemical shifts of aromatic fluorines were found to be sensitive to changes in the hydrogen bonding network that occurred when inhibitors transitioned from solvent into the HP or into ordered detergent micelles. Fluorescence intensities and emission maxima of autofluorescent compounds responded to changes in the local environment. Conclusions: Gp41 – ligand binding occurred under all conditions, but was diminished in the presence of detergents. NMR and fluorescence studies revealed that dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) was a poor substitute for membrane in this system, while liposomes could mimic the membrane surroundings. General significance: Our findings suggest that development of high potency small molecule binders to the HP may be frustrated by competition between binding to the HP and binding to the bilayer membrane.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0304416520302361;8.8;7.4;7.4;03044165;S0304416520302361;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0304416520302361;;

In the previous study, we found host factor coiled-coil domain containing protein 8 (CCDC8) can strongly inhibit HIV-1 production, but the underline mechanism is not clear. Here we show that overexpression of CCDC8 reverses the normal HIV-1 production process, and causes newly assembled HIV-1 Gag particles to be endocytosed on the plasma membrane, rather than budding out. Live-cell imaging system captured the moment of CCDC8-mediated Gag internalization on the plasma membrane, and the speed of Gag turnover is up to 1.53 m/s, much faster than Gag assembly on the plasma membrane. After Gag internalization, it accumulates in the cellular organelle—lysosome for degradation, but not proteasome, autophagosome, endoplasmic reticulum, clathrin or recycling endosome. In addition, CCDC8 is a membrane-associated protein, and N-terminal of CCDC8 is very important for membrane binding, and also important for inhibition of Gag assembly. C-terminal deletion of CCDC8 has a little effect on anti-HIV-1 effect. Moreover, CCDC8 is phosphorylated at amino acid threonine T87 and serine S261, and mono-methylated at lysine K491. Alanine mutations of T87A, S261A and K491A singly or in combination do not affect CCDC8 anti-HIV activity. In conclusion, overexpression of CCDC8 can cause newly assembled HIV-1 Gag particles on the plasma membrane to be endocytosed and degraded in lysosome.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68341-3;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

We investigated HIV-1 transmission networks in men who have sex with men (MSM), injecting drug users (IDU), female sex workers (FSW) and heterosexuals (HET) in coastal Kenya. We used maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetics to analyse new (N = 163) and previously published (N = 495) HIV-1 polymerase sequences collected during 2005–2019. Of the 658 sequences, 131 (20%) were from MSM, 58 (9%) IDU, 109 (17%) FSW, and 360 (55%) HET. Overall, 206 (31%) sequences formed 61 clusters. Most clusters (85%) consisted of sequences from the same risk group, suggesting frequent within-group transmission. The remaining clusters were mixed between HET/MSM (7%), HET/FSW (5%), and MSM/FSW (3%) sequences. One large IDU-exclusive cluster was found, indicating an independent sub-epidemic among this group. Phylodynamic analysis of this cluster revealed a steady increase in HIV-1 infections among IDU since the estimated origin of the cluster in 1987. Our results suggest mixing between high-risk groups and heterosexual populations and could be relevant for the development of targeted HIV-1 prevention programmes in coastal Kenya.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63731-z;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

However, the molecular events underlying HIV neuropathogenesis remain elusive, mainly due to lack of brain-representative experimental systems to study HIV-CNS pathology. To fill this gap, we developed a three-dimensional (3D) human brain organoid (hBORG) model containing major cell types important for HIV-1 neuropathogenesis; neurons and astrocytes along with incorporation of HIV-infected microglia. Both infected and uninfected microglia infiltrated into hBORGs resulting in a triculture system (MG-hBORG) that mirrors the multicellular network observed in HIV-infected human brain. Moreover, the MG-hBORG model supported productive viral infection and exhibited increased inflammatory response by HIV-infected MG-hBORGs, releasing tumor necrosis factor (TNF-) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) and thereby mimicking the chronic neuroinflammatory environment observed in HIV-infected individuals. This model offers great promise for basic understanding of how HIV-1 infection alters the CNS compartment and induces pathological changes, paving the way for discovery of biomarkers and new therapeutic targets.";http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72214-0;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

This process is widely employed by human viruses such as HIV and SARS coronavirus and is critical for their replication. Here, we developed a high-throughput approach to assess the frameshifting potential of a sequence. We designed and tested >12,000 sequences based on 15 viral and human PRF events, allowing us to systematically dissect the rules governing ribosomal frameshifting and discover novel regulatory inputs based on amino acid properties and tRNA availability. We assessed the natural variation in HIV gag-pol frameshifting rates by testing >500 clinical isolates and identified subtype-specific differences and associations between viral load in patients and the optimality of PRF rates. We devised computational models that accurately predict frameshifting potential and frameshifting rates, including subtle differences between HIV isolates.

HIV-1 Tat protein can penetrate cell membrane freely and secrete into extracellular medium. Exo-Tat loses this penetrating property. HIV-1 Tat protein can damage the synaptic membranes contributing to the development of dementia in HIV-1 infected patients. To investigate whether the penetrating property attributes to synaptic damage in vivo, we have generated adeno-associated viruses AAV-Tat and AAV-Exo-Tat viruses.

The mRNA and protein expression levels in blood, brain, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, muscle and spleen were determined on day 21.

Human milk (HM) exosomes are highly enriched in microRNAs (miRNAs), which play an important role in neonatal immunity. Furthermore, HM exosomes from healthy donors are known to inhibit HIV-1 infection and transmission; however, the effect of HIV-1 on HM exosomal miRNA signatures remains unknown. In this study, we used nCounter NanoString technology and investigated miRNAs expression profiles in first week postpartum HM exosomes from HIV-1 infected and uninfected control mothers (n = 36). Our results indicated that HIV-1 perturbed the differential expression patterns of 19 miRNAs (13 upregulated and 6 downregulated) in HIV-1 infected women compared to healthy controls.

The HIV-1 gp41-derived antigens anchored in the virosome membrane, along with the adjuvant 3M-052 (TLR7/8 agonist) on the same particle, served as a candidate vaccine for the proof of concept for establishing manufacturing processes, which can be directly applied or adapted to other virosomal vaccines or lipid-based particles. Heat spray-dried powders suitable for nasal or oral delivery, and freeze-dried sublingual tablets were successfully developed as solid dosage forms for mucosal vaccination. The antigenic properties of vaccinal antigens with key gp41 epitopes were maintained, preserving the original immunogenicity of the starting liquid form, and also when solid forms were exposed to high temperature (40 °C) for up to 3 months, with minimal antigen and adjuvant content variation. Virosomes reconstituted from the powder forms remained as free particles with similar size, virosome uptake by antigen-presenting cells in vitro was comparable to virosomes from the liquid form, and the presence of excipients specific to each solid form did not prevent virosome transport to the draining lymph nodes of immunized mice. Virosome integrity was also preserved during exposure to <15 °C, mimicking accidental freezing conditions. These “ready to use and all-in-one” thermostable needle-free virosomal HIV-1 mucosal vaccines offer the advantage of simplified logistics with a lower dependence on the cold chain during shipments and distribution.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-020-0190-9;1.4;3.5;6.7;;;;;

R5-tropic viruses are predominantly detected during early infection. A switch to X4-tropism often occurs during the course of infection. X4-tropism switching is strongly associated with accelerated disease progression and jeopardizes CCR5-based HIV-1 cure strategies. It is unclear whether host immunological factors play a causative role in tropism switching. We investigated the relationship between immunological factors and X4-tropism in a cross-sectional study in HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C)-infected patients and in a longitudinal HIV-1 subtype B (HIV-1B) seroconverter cohort. Principal component analysis identified a cluster of immunological markers (%HLA-DR+ CD4+ T-cells, %CD38+HLA-DR+ CD4+ T-cells, %CD38+HLA-DR+ CD8+ T-cells, %CD70+ CD4+ T-cells, %CD169+ monocytes, and absolute CD4+ T-cell count) in HIV-1C patients that was independently associated with X4-tropism (aOR 1.044, 95% CI 1.003–1.087, p = 0.0392). Analysis of individual cluster contributors revealed strong correlations of two markers of T-cell activation (%HLA-DR+ CD4+ T-cells, %HLA-DR+CD38+ CD4+ T-cells) with X4-tropism, both in HIV-1C patients (p = 0.01;p = 0.03) and HIV-1B patients (p = 0.0003;p = 0.0001). Follow-up data from HIV-1B patients subsequently revealed that T-cell activation precedes and independently predicts X4-tropism switching (aHR 1.186, 95% CI 1.065–1.321, p = 0.002), providing novel insights into HIV-1 pathogenesis and CCR5-based curative strategies.";http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-71699-z;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

AFF1/4 is the scaffold protein that recruits other components of SEC and forms dimer depending on its THD domain (TPRL with Handle Region Dimerization Domain). Here we report the crystal structure of the human AFF4-THD at the resolution of 2.4 Å. The 4, 5, and 6 of one AFF4-THD mediate the formation of a dimer and pack tightly against the equivalent part of the second molecule in the dimer of AFF-THD. Mutagenesis analysis revealed that single mutations of either Phe1014 or Tyr1096 of AFF4 to alanine impair the formation of the AFF4 dimer. In addition, transactivation assay also indicated that Phe1014 and Tyr1096 of AFF4 are critical to the transactivation activity of AFF4. Interestingly, the corresponding residues Phe1063 and Tyr1145 in AFF1 have an effect on the transactivation of HIV-1 provirus. However, such mutations of AFF1/4 have no effect on the interaction of AFF1/4 with other subunits of the SEC. Together, our data demonstrated that the dimerization of AFF1/4 is essential to transactivation of HIV-1 provirus.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-020-0142-6;4.1;6.4;9.2;20565968;;;;

However, natural virological suppression and absence of immune dysfunction are not always long-term sustained. We define exceptional EC (EEC) as HIV-1 subjects who maintain the EC characteristics without disease progression for more than 25 years. We analyzed three EEC, diagnosed between 1988 and 1992, who never showed signs of clinical disease progression in absence of any antiretroviral treatment. A comprehensive clinical, virological, and immunological study was performed. The individuals simultaneously exhibited 3 described host protective alleles, low levels of total HIV-1 DNA (<20 copies/106 CD4+ T-cells) without evidence of replication-competent viruses (<0.025 IUPM), consistent with high levels of defective genomes, strong cellular HIV-1-specific immune response, and a high poly-functionality index (>0.50). Inflammation levels of EEC were similar to HIV-1 negative donors. Remarkably, they showed an exceptional lack of viral evolution and 8-fold lower genetic diversity (<0.01 s/n) in env gene than other EC. We postulate that these EEC represent cases of spontaneous functional HIV-1 cure. A non-functional and non-genetically evolving viral reservoir along with an HIV-1-specific immune response seems to be key for the spontaneous functional cure.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-58696-y;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

We characterized the local phylodynamics of HIV-1 in DC using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Viral samples from 68 participants from 2016 through 2017 were sequenced and paired with epidemiological data. Phylogenetic and network inferences, drug resistant mutations (DRMs), subtypes and HIV-1 diversity estimations were completed. Haplotypes were reconstructed to infer transmission clusters. Phylodynamic inferences based on the HIV-1 polymerase (pol) and envelope genes (env) were compared. Higher HIV-1 diversity (n.s.) was seen in men who have sex with men, heterosexual, and male participants in DC. 54.0% of the participants contained at least one DRM. The 40–49 year-olds showed the highest prevalence of DRMs (22.9%). Phylogenetic analysis of pol and env sequences grouped 31.9–33.8% of the participants into clusters. HIV-TRACE grouped 2.9–12.8% of participants when using consensus sequences and 9.0–64.2% when using haplotypes. NGS allowed us to characterize the local phylodynamics of HIV-1 in DC more broadly and accurately, given a better representation of its diversity and dynamics. Reconstructed haplotypes provided novel and deeper phylodynamic insights, which led to networks linking a higher number of participants. Our understanding of the HIV-1 epidemic was expanded with the powerful coupling of HIV-1 NGS data with epidemiological data.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-58410-y;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

Therefore, we analyzed factors related to CA-MRSA infection and performed a molecular epidemiological investigation. Methods: HIV-1-infected patients were diagnosed with SSTIs related to S. aureus between 2007 and 2017, and MRSA was classified into community and hospital-acquired types according to published criteria. Information was collected retrospectively from clinical records, and multivariate analysis by logistic regression was performed concerning factors related to CA-MRSA infection. We evaluated the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type, multilocus sequence type, and the presence of genes encoding Panton–Valentine leucocidin (PVL) in 27 MRSA samples isolated during and after 2015. Results: We found 218 episodes of SSTIs in 169 patients, and among initial episodes of SSTIs, the MRSA ratio was higher from 2015 to 2017 relative to that from 2007 to 2014 (88% vs. 44%; p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that in men having sex with men [MSM; odds ratio (OR): 13] and exhibiting onset during and after 2015 (OR: 5.4), CD4+ cell count 200 cells/L (OR: 5.6) and the presence of lesions in the lower abdomen or buttocks (OR: 9.5) were independent factors related to CA-MRSA infection. Additionally, PVL+/ST8/SCCmec type IV MRSA was the predominant pathogen (22 cases; 81%).

The NCp7, which is cleaved from Gag during viral maturation, is a nucleic acid chaperone, coating and protecting the gRNA. In this study, an RT-qPCR-based approach was developed to quantitatively compare the Psi-selectivity of Gag and NCp7 in the presence of bacterial or 293T total RNAs. The binding affinity of Gag and NCp7 to the stem-loop (SL) 3 of Psi was also compared using surface plasmon resonance. We found that Gag selected more Psi-RNA than NCp7 from both E. coli BL21 (DE3) and in vitro binding reactions, and Gag bound to SL3-RNA with a higher affinity than NCp7. Moreover, Gag contained two Zn2+ whereas NCp7 contained one. The N-terminal zinc-finger motif of NCp7 lost most of its Zn2+-binding activity. Deletion of N-terminal amino acids 1–11 of NCp7 resulted in increased Psi-selectivity, SL3-affinity and Zn2+ content. These results indicated that Zn2+ coordination of Gag is critical for Psi-binding and selection. Removal of Zn2+ from the first zinc-finger motif during or after Gag cleavage to generate mature NCp7 might serve as a switch to regulate the functions of Gag NC domain and mature NCp7. Our study will be helpful to elucidate the important roles that Zn2+ plays in the viral life cycle, and may benefit further investigations of the function of HIV-1 Gag and NCp7.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S030090842030239X;5.9;5.9;5.9;03009084;S030090842030239X;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S030090842030239X;;

Data Sources: Phase III clinical trials and review articles were identified through PubMed (1996 to March 2020) and ClinicalTrials.gov (2000 to May 2020) using the keywords dolutegravir, lamivudine, and HIV. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Relevant clinical trials and review articles available in English evaluating efficacy and safety of DTG and 3TC were included. Data Synthesis: The once-daily, single-tablet regimen of DTG/3TC is the first dual antiretroviral therapy (ART) recommended for initial therapy in treatment-naïve adults with HIV-1 infection. DTG and 3TC were compared with a regimen of DTG and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine in the GEMINI studies and demonstrated noninferiority for the primary end point of virological suppression at up to 96 weeks. No treatment-emergent resistance mutations were identified in a small group of participants who did not reach virological suppression. The regimen is well tolerated, and the most common adverse events reported in trials include headache, diarrhea, nausea, insomnia, and fatigue. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This dual-ART regimen is a favorable treatment option for ART-naïve patients with HIV-1 RNA <500 000 copies/mL, absence of hepatitis B virus, and no resistance to DTG or 3TC. Benefits of dual ART include reduction in treatment-related adverse events and toxicities, drug interactions, and cost. In addition, the once-daily, single-tablet formulation promotes adherence. Conclusions: DTG/3TC has demonstrated efficacy in maintaining virological suppression in ART-naïve patients at up to 96 weeks while minimizing treatment-related adverse events and toxicities.;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1060028020933772;5.7;5.2;4.3;10600280;;;;

To investigate host factors which promote HIV-1 latency, we conducted a genome-wide functional knockout screen using CRISPR-Cas9 in a HIV-1 latency cell line model. This screen identified IWS1, POLE3, POLR1B, PSMD1, and TGM2 as potential regulators of HIV-1 latency, of which PSMD1 and TMG2 could be confirmed pharmacologically. Further investigation of PSMD1 revealed that an interacting enzyme, the deubiquitinase UCH37, was also involved in HIV-1 latency. We therefore conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the deubiquitinase family by gene knockout, identifying several deubiquitinases, UCH37, USP14, OTULIN, and USP5 as possible HIV-1 latency regulators. A specific inhibitor of USP14, IU1, reversed HIV-1 latency and displayed synergistic effects with other latency reversal agents. IU1 caused degradation of TDP-43, a negative regulator of HIV-1 transcription. Collectively, this study is the first comprehensive evaluation of deubiquitinases in HIV-1 latency and establishes that they may hold a critical role.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62375-3;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

The main circulating forms were the circulating recombinant form (CRF) 02_AG (44% of the analysed sequences), CRF43_02G (16%), and subtype G (8%). Twenty-three percent of the sequences represented unique recombinant forms (URFs), whereof 37 (11%) could be grouped into seven potentially novel CRFs. Bayesian phylodynamic analysis suggested that five major Nigerian HIV-1 sub-epidemics were introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, close to the Nigerian Civil War. The analysis also indicated that the number of effective infections decreased in Nigeria after the introduction of free antiretroviral treatment in 2006. Finally, Bayesian phylogeographic analysis suggested gravity-like dynamics in which virus lineages first emerge and expand within large urban centers such as Abuja and Lagos, before migrating towards smaller rural areas. This study provides novel insight into the Nigerian HIV-1 epidemic and may have implications for future HIV-1 prevention strategies in Nigeria and other severely affected countries.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59944-x;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

From 2016-2017, 199 plasma samples were collected from 24 blood centers and confirmed as HIV viral load positive or serologically reactive in National Centers for Clinical Laboratories (NCCL), of which 179 were sequenced and subtyped in the gag, protease (PR)-reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN) and/or envelope (env) regions. DRMs in PR-RT and IN regions were analyzed in Stanford HIVdb Program. The majority of subtypes were circulating recombinant form (CRF) 07_BC (34.6%) and CRF01_AE (32.4%); many unique recombinant forms (URFs) (39, 21.8%) and other rare CRFs were observed in the study. Notably, CRF02_AG and CRF06_cpx strains typically found in Africa were firstly identified amongst Chinese blood donors. DRMs were common, with 28 of 179 (15.6%) specimens carrying DRMs, including the PR N88S and RT K103N mutations, which have been implicated in elevated resistance to antiretroviral drugs. Furthermore, 4 HIV-1 isolates (2.4%, 4/168) had surveillance drug-resistance mutation (SDRM), including 3 nonnucleosidereverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) SDRMs (1 K101E, 2 K103N) and 1 protease inhibitor (PI) SDRM (M46I). The HIV viral diversity among blood donors observed in this study suggest that ongoing HIV-1 recombination is becoming progressively complex in China, and lots of DRMs found in the study exacerbate the primary drug resistance landscape, which highlight the necessity of timely genotypic drug resistance monitoring and molecular surveillance of HIV-1 among blood donors.";http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64463-w;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

Nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors, such as entecavir (ETV) and lamivudine (3TC), serve as crucial anti-HBV drugs. However, structural studies of HBV RT have been hampered due to its unexpectedly poor solubility. Here, we show that human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) with HBV-associated amino acid substitutions Y115F/F116Y/Q151M in its RT (HIVY115F/F116Y/Q151M) is highly susceptible to ETV and 3TC. Additionally, we experimentally simulated previously reported ETV/3TC resistance for HBV using HIVY115F/F116Y/Q151M with F160M/M184V (L180M/M204V in HBV RT) substituted. We determined crystal structures for HIV-1 RTY115F/F116Y/Q151M:DNA complexed with 3TC-triphosphate (3TC-TP)/ETV-triphosphate (ETV-TP)/dCTP/dGTP. These structures revealed an atypically tight binding conformation of 3TC-TP, where the Met184 side-chain is pushed away by the oxathiolane of 3TC-TP and exocyclic methylene of ETV-TP. Structural analysis of RTY115F/F116Y/Q151M/F160M/M184V:DNA:3TC-TP also demonstrated that the loosely bound 3TC-TP is misaligned at the active site to prevent a steric clash with the side chain -methyl of Val184. These findings shed light on the common structural mechanism of HBV and HIV-1 resistance to 3TC and ETV and should aid in the design of new agents to overcome drug resistance to 3TC and ETV.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59775-w;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

However, NP-inspired drug leads are declining, among other reasons due to high re-discovery rates. We developed a conceptual framework using the metabolic fingerprint of entire ecosystems (MeE) to facilitate the discovery of global bioactivity hotspots. We assessed the MeE of 305 sites of diverse aquatic ecosystems, worldwide. All samples were tested for antiviral effects against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), followed by a comprehensive screening for cell-modulatory activity by High-Content Screening (HCS). We discovered a very strong HIV-1 inhibition mainly in samples taken from fjords with a strong terrestrial input. Multivariate data integration demonstrated an association of a set of polyphenols with specific biological alterations (endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, and NFkB) caused by these samples. Moreover, we found strong HIV-1 inhibition in one unrelated oceanic sample closely matching to HIV-1-inhibitory drugs on a cytological and a chemical level. Taken together, we demonstrate that even without physical purification, a sophisticated strategy of differential filtering, correlation analysis, and multivariate statistics can be employed to guide chemical analysis, to improve de-replication, and to identify ecosystems with promising characteristics as sources for NP discovery.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57709-0;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

The resurgence of this deadly disease has been inflamed by comorbidity with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The risk of TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than people without HIV. Development of a single vaccine to combat both diseases is an ardent but tenable ambition. Studies have focused on the induction of specific humoral and cellular immune responses against HIV-1 following recombinant BCG (rBCG) expressing HIV-1 antigens. Recent advances in the TB vaccines led to the development of promising candidates such as MTBVAC, the BCG revaccination approach, H4:IC31, H56:IC31, M72/AS01 and more recently, intravenous (IV) BCG. Modification of these vaccine candidates against TB/HIV coinfection could reveal key correlates of protection in a representative animal model. This review discusses the (i) potential TB vaccine candidates that can be exploited for use as a dual vaccine against TB/HIV copandemic (ii) progress made in the realm of TB/HIV dual vaccine candidates in small animal model, NHP model, and human clinical trials (iii) the failures and promising targets for a successful vaccine strategy while delineating the correlates of vaccine-induced protection.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-020-00245-9;1.4;3.5;6.7;;;;;

The Rev protein binds to partially spliced and unspliced viral RNAs and mediates their nuclear export. Therefore, Rev possesses functional domains that enable its shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), a lentivirus, can lead to an immunodeficiency syndrome after a long incubation period, similar to that associated with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The FIV Rev functional domains have been predicted only by homology with those of HIV-1 Rev. In the present study, the nuclear and nucleolar localization signals (NLS and NoLS, respectively) of the FIV Rev were examined. A series of FIV Rev deletion mutants fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were used to localize the NLS in a region spanning amino acids (aa) 81–100. By using alanine substitution mutants, basic residues present between the amino acids (aa) 84–99 of the FIV Rev protein sequence were identified to form the NLS, whereas those between aa 82–95 were associated with the NoLS function. These results further enhance our understanding of how Rev exerts its role in the replication cycle of lentiviruses.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168170220310601;5.1;4.9;5.3;01681702;S0168170220310601;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0168170220310601;;

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected cells within secondary lymphoid tissues exist in a low-oxygen or hypoxic environment in vivo. However, the majority of studies on HIV replication and latency are performed under laboratory conditions where HIFs are inactive. We show a role for HIF-2 in restricting HIV transcription via direct binding to the viral promoter. Hypoxia reduced tumor necrosis factor or histone deacetylase inhibitor, Romidepsin, mediated reactivation of HIV and inhibiting HIF signaling-pathways reversed this phenotype. Our data support a model where the low-oxygen environment of the lymph node may suppress HIV replication and promote latency. We identify a mechanism that may contribute to the limited efficacy of latency reversing agents in reactivating HIV and suggest new strategies to control latent HIV-1.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-1103-1;0;0;2.0;;;;;

A total of 209 partial pol gene sequences of HIV-1 CRF55_01B were sampled during 2007–2015 from 7 provinces of China. Phylogenetic analyses and trait diffusion process of these sequences were performed using Bayesian methods. Distance-based molecular network analyses were performed to infer putative relationships. Characteristics of genetically linked individuals were analyzed. Our study identified that HIV-1 CRF55_01B likely originated among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Guangdong province in January 2003 (April 2000–April 2005), and that Guangdong province and MSM are major hubs for the spread of the HIV-1 CRF55_01B epidemic in China. A Bayesian Skygrid plot revealed that the effective population size of HIV-1 CRF55_01B experienced increased phase followed by a plateau. All sequences from persons of unknown risk clustered within groups who reported MSM risk. This could be because Chinese MSM may not report such risk due to HIV/AIDS-related stigmatization and discrimination. This study inferred the transmission dynamics of the HIV-1 CRF55_01B epidemic in China at high resolution.

Our group previously described that CD4+ T cells from patients with CML on treatment with TKIs such as dasatinib were resistant to HIV-1 infection ex vivo. The main mechanism for this antiviral activity was primarily based on the inhibition of SAMHD1 phosphorylation, which preserves the activity against HIV-1 of this innate immune factor. Approximately 50% CML patients who achieved a deep molecular response (DMR) may safely withdraw TKI treatment without molecular recurrence. Therefore, it has been speculated that TKIs may induce a potent antileukemic response that is maintained in most patients even one year after treatment interruption (TI). Subsequent to in vitro T-cell activation, we observed that SAMHD1 was phosphorylated in CD4+ T cells from CML patients who withdrew TKI treatment more than one year earlier, which indicated that these cells were now susceptible to HIV-1 infection. Importantly, these patients were seronegative for HIV-1 and seropositive for cytomegalovirus (CMV), but without CMV viremia. Although activated CD4+ T cells from CML patients on TI were apparently permissive to HIV-1 infection ex vivo, the frequency of proviral integration was reduced more than 12-fold on average when these cells were infected ex vivo in comparison with cells isolated from untreated, healthy donors. This reduced susceptibility to infection could be related to an enhanced NK-dependent cytotoxic activity, which was increased 8-fold on average when CD4+ T cells were infected ex vivo with HIV-1 in the presence of autologous NK cells. Enhanced cytotoxic activity was also observed in CD8 + T cells from these patients, which showed 8-fold increased expression of TCR and more than 18-fold increased production of IFN upon activation with CMV peptides. In conclusion, treatment with TKIs induced a potent antileukemic response that may also have antiviral effects against HIV-1 and CMV, suggesting that transient use of TKIs in HIV-infected patients could develop a sustained antiviral response that would potentially interfere with HIV-1 reservoir dynamics.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006295220304391;8.4;6.2;7.5;00062952;S0006295220304391;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006295220304391;;

These Abs carry a unique but crucial post-translational modification (PTM), namely O-sulfated tyrosine in the heavy chain complementarity determining region (CDR) H3 loop. Several studies have demonstrated that plants are suitable hosts for the generation of highly active anti-HIV-1 antibodies with the potential to engineer PTMs. Here we report the expression and characterisation of CAP256-VRC26 bNAbs with posttranslational modifications (PTM). Two variants, CAP256-VRC26 (08 and 09) were expressed in glycoengineered Nicotiana benthamiana plants. By in planta co-expression of tyrosyl protein sulfotransferase 1, we installed O-sulfated tyrosine in CDR H3 of both bNAbs. These exhibited similar structural folding to the mammalian cell produced bNAbs, but non-sulfated versions showed loss of neutralisation breadth and potency. In contrast, tyrosine sulfated versions displayed equivalent neutralising activity to mammalian produced antibodies retaining exceptional potency against some subtype C viruses. Together, the data demonstrate the enormous potential of plant-based systems for multiple posttranslational engineering and production of fully active bNAbs for application in passive immunisation or as an alternative for current HIV/AIDS antiretroviral therapy regimens.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63052-1;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

During 2016–2018 the main subtypes were A (26.7%), G (9.7%) and C (7.3%). Recombinants accounted for a third of infections (12.7%/23.6% Circulant/Unique Recombinant Forms). We identified the first CRF47_BF reported in Africa and four transmission clusters. A significant increase of subtype A and sub-subtype F1 and a significant reduction of sub-subtype A1 and subtype D were observed in Kinshasa during 2016–2018 compared to variants circulating in the city from 1983 to 2008. We provide unique and updated information related to HIV-1 variants currently circulating in Kinshasa, reporting the temporal trends of subtypes/CRF/URF during 43 years in the DRC, and providing the most extensive data on children/adolescents.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74558-z;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

Understanding structural properties of vaccine candidate antigens leads to rational design of vaccines which improves their presentation to immune system and facilitates their manufacturing and storage. This study aims to investigate structural properties and stability of one variant of HIV-1 Tat recombinant protein using different spectroscopic, electrophoretic, and microscopic methods. Therefore, after the gene transformation, protein expression was optimized in E. coli cells and the C-terminal His6-tagged protein was purified using Ni-NTA resin. The structural stability of the pure protein was then investigated under different conditions including pH, Zn2+ ions, thermal and chemical stress. Acidic and alkaline pHs affects spectroscopic properties of the vaccine in different ways. The structure unfolding experiment shows relatively poor stability of the zinc-free protein sample compared to the ion-containing one. According to the quenching experiment and also thermal stability study results, the protein has attained more structural compactness in the presence of Zn2+. Secondary structure of the protein is mainly disordered and didn't significantly affect under various conditions. Finally, different degrees of oligomerization and aggregation were found under physiological conditions.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0141813020339015;5.5;6.0;6.9;01418130;S0141813020339015;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0141813020339015;;

Here, we report that a CD4+ T cell repertoire recognizes a glycopeptide epitope on gp120 presented by MHCII pathway. This glycopeptide is strongly immunogenic in eliciting glycan-dependent cellular and humoral immune responses. The glycopeptide specific CD4+ T cells display a prominent feature of Th2 and Th17 differentiation and exert high efficacy and potency to help Env trimer humoral immune responses. Glycopeptide-induced CD4+ T cell response prior to Env trimer immunization elicits neutralizing antibody development and production of antibodies facilitating uptake of immunogens by antigen-presenting cells. Our identification of gp120 glycopeptide–induced, T cell–specific immune responses offers a foundation for developing future knowledge-based vaccines that elicit strong and long-lasting protective immune responses against HIV-1 infection.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16319-0;18.5;18.1;18.1;;;;;

To understand the molecular details of this allostery, here, we introduce Env mutations aimed to prevent CD4-induced rearrangements in the HIV-1 BG505 Env trimer. Binding analysis and singlemolecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer confirm that these mutations prevent CD4-induced transitions of the HIV-1 Env. Structural analysis by singleparticle cryo-electron microscopy performed on the BG505 SOSIP mutant Env proteins shows rearrangements in the gp120 topological layer contacts with gp41. Displacement of a conserved tryptophan (W571) from its typical pocket in these Env mutants renders the Env insensitive to CD4 binding. These results reveal the critical function of W571 as a conformational switch in Env allostery and receptor-mediated viral entry and provide insights on Env conformation that are relevant for vaccine design.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-14196-w;18.5;18.1;18.1;;;;;

Here, we analyzed summary statistics from the largest genome-wide association study of HIV-1 acquisition to-date, consisting of 6,334 infected patients and 7,247 population controls, to advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms implicated in this trait. We found that HIV-1 acquisition is polygenic and heritable, with SNP heritability estimates explaining 28–42% of the variance in this trait at a population level. Genetic correlations alongside UK Biobank data revealed associations with smoking, prospective memory and socioeconomic traits. Gene-level enrichment analysis identified EF-hand calcium binding domain 14 as a novel susceptibility gene for HIV–1 acquisition. We also observed that susceptibility variants for HIV-1 acquisition were significantly enriched for genes expressed in T-cells, but also in striatal and hippocampal neurons. Finally, we tested how polygenic risk scores for HIV-1 acquisition influence blood levels of 35 inflammatory markers in 406 HIV-1-negative individuals. We found that higher genetic risk for HIV-1 acquisition was associated with lower levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand 17. Our findings corroborate a complex model for HIV-1 acquisition, whereby susceptibility is partly heritable and moderated by specific behavioral, cellular and immunological parameters.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59256-0;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

Studies showed that alterations of its membrane-related components, including the transmembrane domain (TMD) and cytoplasmic tail (CT), can reshape the antigenic structure of the Env ectodomain. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we determine the structure of an Env segment encompassing the TMD and a large portion of the CT in bicelles. The structure reveals that the CT folds into amphipathic helices that wrap around the C-terminal end of the TMD, thereby forming a support baseplate for the rest of Env. NMR dynamics measurements provide evidences of dynamic coupling across the TMD between the ectodomain and CT. Pseudovirus-based neutralization assays suggest that CT-TMD interaction preferentially affects antigenic structure near the apex of the Env trimer. These results explain why the CT can modulate the Env antigenic properties and may facilitate HIV-1 Env-based vaccine design.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16165-0;18.5;18.1;18.1;;;;;

Despite the reduction in AIDS-related deaths achieved by current antiretroviral therapies, drawbacks including drug resistance and the failure to eradicate infection highlight the need to identify new pathways to target the infection. Circadian rhythms are endogenous 24-h oscillations which regulate physiological processes including immune responses to infection, and there is an emerging role for the circadian components in regulating viral replication. The molecular clock consists of transcriptional/translational feedback loops that generate rhythms. In mammals, BMAL1 and CLOCK activate rhythmic transcription of genes including the nuclear receptor REV-ERB, which represses BMAL1 and plays an essential role in sustaining a functional clock. We investigated whether REV-ERB activity regulates HIV-1 replication and found REV-ERB agonists inhibited HIV-1 promoter activity in cell lines, primary human CD4 T cells and macrophages, whilst antagonism or genetic disruption of REV-ERB increased promoter activity. The REV-ERB agonist SR9009 inhibited promoter activity of diverse HIV-subtypes and HIV-1 replication in primary T cells. This study shows a role for REV-ERB synthetic agonists to inhibit HIV-1 LTR promoter activity and viral replication, supporting a role for circadian clock components in regulating HIV-1 replication.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70170-3;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

The use of certain antiretroviral drugs can contribute to this process. Methods: We investigated 26 potential biomarkers in serum samples from HIV-1 infected patients virologically suppressed under ART. The main objective of our study was to evaluate if virological suppression achieved with a triple drug regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate co-formulated with emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) as backbone, could correlate with a better immunological and inflammatory profile in relation to the third class of antiretroviral drug administered. The eligible patients were then divided into 3 groups in relation to the third drug associated with TDF/FTC: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) (Group 1, n = 16), protease inhibitors (PI) (Group 2, n = 17) and integrase inhibitors (INI) (Group 3, n = 16). Results: Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were more represented in Group 2 than in Group 3 (IL-1Ra, p = 0.013; IL-12p70 p = 0.039; TNF- p = 0.041; IL-8, p = 0.027; MIP1 , p = 0.033). Eotaxin showed lower levels in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (p = 0.010), while IP-10 was significantly lower in Group 1 compared to both Group 2 and Group 3 (p = 0.003 and p = 0.007, respectively). Conclusions: Our results seem to discourage the administration of PI as a third drug in a virologically effective antiretroviral regimen, as its use is linked to the detection of higher levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in comparison with INI and NNRTI.";https://aidsrestherapy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12981-020-00316-w;3.2;3.8;4.4;;;;;

CD300a has an important role in some viral infections and its expression levels are known to be modulated by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)1 infection on several cell types. The main objective of this work was to investigate CD300a expression and its regulation during HIV-1 specific CD8+ T cell responses. CD300a receptor expression was analysed by multiparametric flow cytometry on CD8+ T lymphocytes from HIV negative donors, naive HIV-1+ individuals and HIV-1+ subjects under suppressive combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). HIV-1 specific CD8+ T cell response was studied by stimulating cells with HIV-1 derived peptides or with a Gag HIV-1 peptide. Our results showed that HIV-1 specific CD8+ T cells expressing higher levels of CD300a were more polyfunctional showing an increased degranulation and cytokine production. Moreover, we observed an up-regulation of CD300a expression after Gag HIV-1 peptide stimulation. Finally, our results demonstrated an inverse correlation between CD300a expression on CD8+ T lymphocytes and HIV disease progression markers. In conclusion, CD300a expression is associated to a better and more polyfunctional HIV-1 specific CD8+ T cell response.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63025-4;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

Notably, the HIV-1 positive individuals were not placed on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the time of recruitment and blood collection. A third group consisting of 10 healthy participants without MDR TB or HIV infection was recruited from the University of the Witwatersrand. Blood samples collected from all three cohorts were employed for extraction of plasma, total RNA and genomic DNA. Results: Our data indicated that the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) genes was significantly increased in HIV-1 positive patients and was lowest in MDR TB-HIV co-infected patients. By contrast, histone acetyltransferase (HAT), histone deacetylase (HDAC), protein tyrosine kinase (PtkA) and protein tyrosine phosphatase (PtpA) mRNA expression levels were substantially enhanced in HIV-1 infected and were lowest in healthy individuals. Conversely, Dicer expression levels were comparable among all three study groups. Conclusion: Promising preliminary data emanating from this investigation may potentially be used for generation of novel vaccines and therapeutic compounds capable of neutralising MDR TB-HIV and HIV-1 infection.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2213716520302563;2.0;2.6;3.5;22137165;S2213716520302563;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2213716520302563;;

It is a non-pathogenic virus and is transmitted among humans mainly through the exposure to contaminated blood and is often associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, among other viruses. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of HPgV viremia, its association with HIV and clinical epidemiological factors, as well as the full-length sequencing and genome characterization of HPgV recovered from blood donors of the HEMOPA Foundation in Belém-PA-Brazil. Methods: Plasma samples were obtained from 459 donors, tested for the presence of HPgV RNA by the RT-qPCR. From these, a total of 26 RT-qPCR positive samples were submitted to the NGS sequencing approach in order to obtain the full genome. Genome characterization and phylogenetic analysis were conducted. Results: The prevalence of HPgV was 12.42%. We observed the highest prevalences among donors aged between 18 and 30 years old (16.5%), with brown skin color (13.2%) and men (15.8%). The newly diagnosed HIV-1 prevalence was 26.67%. The HPgV genotype 2 (2a and 2b) was identified. No data on viral load value was found to corroborate the protective effect of HPgV on HIV evolution. Conclusions: This study provided information regarding the HPgV infection among blood donors from HEMOPA Foundation. Furthermore, we genetically characterized the HPgV circulating strains and described by the first time nearly complete genomes of genotype 2 in Brazilian Amazon.;https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12985-020-01427-6;4.0;4.2;4.5;;;;;

To determine the prevalence of HIV and TB among individuals found at bars in slums of Kampala, Uganda, we enrolled adults found at bars that provided written informed consent. Individuals with alcohol intoxication were excluded. We performed HIV testing using immunochromatographic antibody tests (Alere Determine HIV-1/2 and Chembio HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK). TB was confirmed using the Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay, performed on single spot sputum samples. We enrolled 272 participants from 42 bars in 5 slums. The prevalence of HIV and TB was 11.4% (95% CI 8.1–15.8) and 15 (95% CI 6–39) per 1,000 population respectively. Predictors of HIV were female sex (aOR 5.87, 95% CI 2.05–16.83), current cigarette smoking (aOR 3.23, 95% CI 1.02–10.26), history of TB treatment (aOR 10.19, 95% CI 3.17–32.82) and CAGE scores of 2–3 (aOR 3.90, 95% CI 1.11–13.70) and 4 (aOR 4.77, 95% CI 1.07–21.35). The prevalence of HIV and TB was twice and four times the national averages respectively. These findings highlight the need for concurrent programmatic screening for both HIV and TB among high risk populations in slums.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70472-6;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

The FCH domain only 1 (FCHO1) protein is key molecule involved in the early stages of CME formation. The consequences of mutations in FCHO1 in humans were unknown. We identify ten unrelated patients with variable T and B cell lymphopenia, who are homozygous for six distinct mutations in FCHO1. We demonstrate that these mutations either lead to mislocalisation of the protein or prevent its interaction with binding partners. Live-cell imaging of cells expressing mutant variants of FCHO1 provide evidence of impaired formation of clathrin coated pits (CCP). Patient T cells are unresponsive to T cell receptor (TCR) triggering. Internalisation of the TCR receptor is severely perturbed in FCHO1-deficient Jurkat T cells but can be rescued by expression of wild-type FCHO1. Thus, we discovered a previously unrecognised critical role of FCHO1 and CME during T-cell development and function in humans.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14809-9;18.5;18.1;18.1;;;;;

We investigated the combined impact of the latency reversing agent vorinostat (VOR) and AGS-004, an autologous dendritic cell immunotherapeutic, on the HIV reservoir. HIV+, stably treated participants in whom resting CD4+ T cell-associated HIV RNA (rca-RNA) increased after VOR exposure ex vivo and in vivo received 4 doses of AGS-004 every 3 weeks, followed by VOR every 72 hours for 30 days, and then the cycle repeated. Change in VOR-responsive host gene expression, HIV-specific T cell responses, low-level HIV viremia, rca-RNA, and the frequency of resting CD4+ T-cell infection (RCI) was measured at baseline and after each cycle. No serious treatment-related adverse events were observed among five participants. As predicted, VOR-responsive host genes responded uniformly to VOR dosing. Following cycles of AGS-004 and VOR, rca-RNA decreased significantly in only two participants, with a significant decrease in SCA observed in one of these participants. However, unlike other cohorts dosed with AGS-004, no uniform increase in HIV-specific immune responses following vaccination was observed. Finally, no reproducible decline of RCI, defined as a decrease of >50%, was observed. AGS-004 and VOR were safe and well-tolerated, but no substantial impact on RCI was measured. In contrast to previous clinical data, AGS-004 did not induce HIV-specific immune responses greater than those measured at baseline. More efficacious antiviral immune interventions, perhaps paired with more effective latency reversal, must be developed to clear persistent HIV infection.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61878-3;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

To investigate the HIV clades circulating in this community a retrospective study was performed in 557 HIV-infected immigrants living in 12 Italian cities. Immigrants originated from East-Europe and Central-Asia (11.7%), North Africa and Middle East (7.3%), South and South-East Asia (7.2%), Latin America and the Caribbean (14.4%), and sub-Saharan Africa (59.4%). More than 87% of immigrants were on antiretroviral therapy (ART), although 26.6% of them were viremic. A 22.0% of immigrants had hepatitis (HBV and/or HCV) and/or tuberculosis. HIV phylogenetic analysis on sequences from 192 immigrants showed the presence of clades B (23.4%), G (16.1%), C (10.4%), A1 (9.4%), F1 (5.2%), D (1.6%) and Circulating Recombinant Forms (CRFs) (33.9%). CRF02_AG represented 72.3% of the total CRFs. Clusters between immigrants and Italian natives were also present. Drug resistance mutations to NRTI, NNRTI, and PI drug classes occurred in 29.1% of ART-treated and in 12.9% of ART-naïve individuals.

However, the virus rapidly evolves to exploit the IFN- response for its replication, spread, and pathogenic function. In this study, we attempted to determine IFN- susceptibility and productivity of infectious transmitted/founder (TF) (n = 8) and non-transmitted (NT) viruses (n = 8) derived from HIV-1 infected infants. Independent experiments were carried out to determine IFN- resistance, replication fitness, and viral productivity in CD4+ T cells over a short period. In vitro studies showed that TF viruses were resistant to IFN- during the very near moment of transmission, but in the subsequent time points, they became susceptible to IFN-. We did not observe much difference in replicative fitness of the TF viruses in cultures treated with and without IFN-, but the difference was significant in the case of NT viruses obtained from the same individual. Despite increased susceptibility to IFN-, NT viruses produced more viral particles than TF viruses. Similar results were also obtained in cultures treated with maraviroc (MVC). The study identified unique characteristics of TF viruses thus prompting further investigation into virus-host interaction occurring during the early stages of HIV infection.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59596-x;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

But the underlying mechanisms of these inhibitions are unknown. Here we show that PSGL-1 directly binds to cellular actin filaments (F-actin) to restrict actin dynamics, which leads to inhibition of HIV DNA synthesis. PSGL-1 is incorporated into nascent virions and restricts actin dynamics in the virions, which partially accounts for the inhibition of virion infectivity. More potently, PSGL-1 inhibits incorporation of Env proteins into nascent virions, causing a loss of envelope spikes on the virions as shown by Cryo-electron microscopy and super-resolution imaging. This loss is associated with a profound defect in viral entry. Mechanistically, PSGL-1 binds gp41 and sequesters gp41 at the plasma membrane, explaining the inhibition of Env incorporation in nascent virions. PSGL-1’s dual anti-HIV mechanisms represent novel strategies of human cells to defend against HIV infection.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-020-0184-9;4.1;6.4;9.2;20565968;;;;

TLRs are instrumental in activating inflammatory responses in innate immune cells, but their function in adaptive immune cells is less well understood. Here we show that synthetic ligands of TLR8 boosted T cell receptor signaling, resulting in increased cytokine production and upregulation of surface activation markers. Adjuvant TLR8 stimulation, but not TLR7 or TLR9, further promoted T helper cell differentiation towards Th1 and Th17. In addition, we found that endosomal HIV induced cytokine secretion from CD4+ T cells in a TLR8-specific manner. TLR8 engagement also enhanced HIV-1 replication and potentiated the reversal of latency in patient-derived T cells. The adjuvant TLR8 activity in T cells can contribute to viral dissemination in the lymph node and low-grade inflammation in HIV patients. In addition, it can potentially be exploited for therapeutic targeting and vaccine development.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13837-4;18.5;18.1;18.1;;;;;

Mainly due to lack of a full-length double-domain APOBEC structure, it is unknown how CD1/CD2 domains connect and how dimerization/multimerization is linked to RNA binding and virion packaging for HIV-1 restriction. We report rhesus macaque A3G structures that show different inter-domain packing through a short linker and refolding of CD2. The A3G dimer structure has a hydrophobic dimer-interface matching with that of the previously reported CD1 structure. A3G dimerization generates a surface with intensified positive electrostatic potentials (PEP) for RNA binding and dimer stabilization. Unexpectedly, mutating the PEP surface and the hydrophobic interface of A3G does not abolish virion packaging and HIV-1 restriction. The data support a model in which only one RNA-binding mode is critical for virion packaging and restriction of HIV-1 by A3G.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14377-y;18.5;18.1;18.1;;;;;

Advancing translation of CCR5-mutant-based cellular therapies for HIV requires development of novel physiologically relevant animal models. Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCMs), with high degree of MHC allele sharing, are valuable models for HIV-1 research and stem cell therapies. To facilitate the generation of a CCR5-mutant MHC-defined MCM model, we explored editing the CCR5 gene in MCM embryos via CRISPR-Cas9. We refined ovarian stimulation and in vitro fertilization (IVF) methods established for Chinese cynomolgus macaques to generate in vitro MCM embryos. Time-lapse embryo imaging was performed to assess the timing of MCM embryonic developmental events in control and CRISPR-Cas9 microinjected embryos. Using a dual-guide gene targeting approach, biallelic deletions in the CCR5 gene were introduced into ~ 23–37% of MCM embryos. In addition, single blastomere PCR analysis revealed mosaicism in CCR5 editing within the same embryo. Successful development of IVF and CCR5 editing protocols in MCM embryos lays a foundation for the creation of CCR5-mutant MCMs to assess novel stem cell-based HIV therapeutics.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75295-z;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

Infected infants develop plasma bnAbs frequently and as early as 1-year post-infection suggesting factors governing bnAb induction in infants are distinct from adults. Understanding viral characteristics in infected infants with early bnAb responses will provide key information about antigenic triggers driving B cell maturation pathways towards induction of bnAbs. Herein, we evaluate the presence of plasma bnAbs in a cohort of 51 HIV-1 clade-C infected infants and identify viral factors associated with early bnAb responses. Plasma bnAbs targeting V2-apex on the env are predominant in infant elite and broad neutralizers. Circulating viral variants in infant elite neutralizers are susceptible to V2-apex bnAbs. In infant elite neutralizers, multivariant infection is associated with plasma bnAbs targeting diverse autologous viruses.

Here, we imaged nuclear entry and transport of HIV-1 replication complexes in cell lines, primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and CD4+ T cells. We show that viral replication complexes traffic to and accumulate within nuclear speckles and that these steps precede the completion of viral DNA synthesis. HIV-1 transport to nuclear speckles is dependent on the interaction of the capsid proteins with host cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 6 (CPSF6), which is also required to stabilize the association of the viral replication complexes with nuclear speckles. Importantly, integration site analyses reveal a strong preference for HIV-1 to integrate into speckle-associated genomic domains. Collectively, our results demonstrate that nuclear speckles provide an architectural basis for nuclear homing of HIV-1 replication complexes and subsequent integration into associated genomic loci.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17256-8;18.5;18.1;18.1;;;;;

The three peptides show greater inhibitory potencies in cellular and mucosal tissue pre-clinical models than the parent sequence and the retro-enantio shows a strengthened proteolytic stability. Since HIV-1 fusion inhibitor peptides need to be embedded in the membrane to properly interact with their viral target, the structural features were determined by NMR spectroscopy in micelles and solved by using restrained molecular dynamics calculations. Both parent and retro-enantio peptides demonstrate a topology compatible with a shared helix–turn–helix conformation and assemble similarly in the membrane maintaining the active conformation needed for its interaction with the viral target site. This study represents a straightforward approach to design new targeted peptides as HIV-1 fusion inhibitors and lead us to define a retro-enantio peptide as a good candidate for pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV-1.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-71404-0;4.8;6.4;7.2;;;;;

Many bnAbs isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals are encoded by immunoglobulin gene rearrangments with infrequent naive B cell precursors and with unusual genetic features that may be subject to host regulatory control. Here, we administer antibodies targeting immune cell regulatory receptors CTLA-4, PD-1 or OX40 along with HIV envelope (Env) vaccines to rhesus macaques and bnAb immunoglobulin knock-in (KI) mice expressing diverse precursors of CD4 binding site HIV-1 bnAbs. CTLA-4 blockade augments HIV-1 Env antibody responses in macaques, and in a bnAb-precursor mouse model, CTLA-4 blocking or OX40 agonist antibodies increase germinal center B and T follicular helper cells and plasma neutralizing antibodies. Thus, modulation of CTLA-4 or OX40 immune checkpoints during vaccination can promote germinal center activity and enhance HIV-1 Env antibody responses.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14670-w;18.5;18.1;18.1;;;;;

We showed previously that short-term broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) therapy given 24 h after oral exposure cleared simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) in a macaque model of perinatal infection. Here, we report that all infants given either a single dose of bNAbs at 30 h, or a 21-day triple-drug ART regimen at 48 h, are aviremic with almost no virus in tissues. In contrast, bNAb treatment beginning at 48 h leads to tight control without adaptive immune responses in half of animals. We conclude that both bNAbs and ART mediate effective post-exposure prophylaxis in infant macaques within 30–48 h of oral SHIV exposure. Our findings suggest that optimizing the treatment regimen may extend the window of opportunity for preventing perinatal HIV infection when treatment is delayed.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13972-y;18.5;18.1;18.1;;;;;

We here describe, in a cohort of > 170 in utero HIV-infected infants from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, fetal immune sex differences resulting in a 1.5–2-fold increased female susceptibility to intrauterine HIV infection. Viruses transmitted to females have lower replicative capacity (p = 0.0005) and are more type I interferon-resistant (p = 0.007) than those transmitted to males. Cord blood cells from females of HIV-uninfected sex-discordant twins are more activated (p = 0.01) and more susceptible to HIV infection in vitro (p = 0.03). Sex differences in outcome include superior maintenance of aviraemia among males (p = 0.007) that is not explained by differential antiretroviral therapy adherence. These data demonstrate sex-specific innate immune selection of HIV associated with increased female susceptibility to in utero infection and enhanced functional cure potential among infected males.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15632-y;18.5;18.1;18.1;;;;;
